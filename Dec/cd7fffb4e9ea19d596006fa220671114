Researchers in the United States (U. S.) have found that late dinners and heavy evening snacking don’t favour women’s hearts based on their damaging impact. The researchers at New York City’s Columbia University found that those who ate more of their daily calories in the evening had a higher risk of heart disease. Their findings were presented at the American Heart Association’s annual meeting, which held in Philadelphia, United States, from November 16 to 18. Considering that these findings were presented at a medical meeting, they should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. Columbia Associate Research Scientist, Nour Makarem, who led the study, said shifting the timing of eating was “a simple, modifiable behaviour that can help lower heart disease risk.” The term heart disease is often used interchangeably with the term cardiovascular disease, which generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Makarem said most of the 112 women, with average age of 33, involved in the study, ate some food after 6p.m., but those who consumed a higher proportion of their daily calories in the evening tended to have had poorer heart health, the ‘NewsmaxHealth’ reported. In fact, with every one per cent increase in calories consumed after 6p.m., heart health declined accordingly. Similar findings occurred with every one per cent increase in daily calories consumed after 8p.m., according to the study. Specifically, women who ate more of their daily calories in the evening were more likely to have higher blood pressure, higher body mass index (BMI) and poorer long-term control of blood sugar. Makarem said: “So far, lifestyle approaches to prevent heart disease have focused on what we eat and how much we eat,” adding that the ‘when of eating’ may be important, too.
