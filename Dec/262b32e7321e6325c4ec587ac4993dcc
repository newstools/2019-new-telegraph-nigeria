The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has described the release of former National Security Adviser (NSA), Col. Sambo Dasuki (rtd) and the publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore, as a proof of a new dawn for the nation’s democracy. CAN President, Rev. Samson Ayokunle, who commended the Federal Government in a statement made available to journalists in Abuja yesterday, said the release was a Christmas gift to Nigerians. According to him, the body would continue to support the Federal Government in ensuring peace and stability as long as it continues to respect the rule of law. Ayokunle said: “We are very happy with the decision of the Federal Government to release the duo of Dasuki and Sowore as mandated by the Federal High Court, Abuja. We appreciate the Attorney General of the Federation and the Minister of Justice for his intervention and counsel. “The action of the government is commendable and it is a new dawn for democracy. As long as the Federal Government continues to respect the rule of law and the Constitution, CAN will continue to work with the government to ensure that there is peace and stability in the polity. “We will not cease to pray for President Muhammadu Buhari and his team for a successful tenure of office. Nigeria should be a pacesetter for the continent in everything good, being the giant of Africa in the abundance of human and material resources.”
