In commemoration of this year’s World AIDs Day, the management of Flour Mills Nigeria (FMN) Plc has cautioned its staff about their lifestyles, discrimination and stigmatisation at the workplace in anticipation of supporting victims with HIV if the need arises. Group Managing Director, FMN, Paul Miyonmide Gbededo made this appeal when the company marked 2019 World AIDs Day in Lagos, where he implored workers in the organisation to know their HIV status considering the current state of the epidemic – AIDS in the country. In his address, Gbededo explained that the awareness about the scourge of HIV/AIDS in the environment was very germane and critical, saying that the world has committed to end the AIDs epidemic by 2030 as part of the sustainable development goals (SDGs), with Nigeria ready to play key role towards achieving this laudable objective. According to him, at the FMN, the management was encouraging workers on the importance of collaboration across the various departments and businesses in line with its PIILOT core values. He said, “If we must achieve our collective objective as a family in FMN, we must recognise the importance of collaboration across our various departments and businesses. Going by PIILOT – our core values, we are constantly reminded of the importance of values like ownership and teamwork.
