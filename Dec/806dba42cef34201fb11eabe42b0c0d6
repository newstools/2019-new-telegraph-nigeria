There’s beyond doubts little or nothing else King of Fuji Music, K1-De-Ultimate, needs to prove.  He’s a class act. You may not have heard that the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi has indicated his interest to confer on Alhaji Wasiu Ayinde Marshal aka K1 De Ultimate, the powerful traditional title of the Maiyegun of Yorubaland.  It might also interest you to know that as soon as the highly revered monarch sent a letter to the top-flight musician on his intention, he (K1) quickly put a call to his auto merchant in the United States of America to make an order for the latest Rolls Royce Ghost that costs a whopping N200million to be delivered to his doorstep before the celebration day.  The wonder-on-wheels, we gathered would be delivered to K1 by the first week in January.  Meanwhile, many close to him enough knows that K1 loves super machines from a very young age. He has driven a lot of good cars in the past with the latest being a Bentley, which he has been using to paint the streets in different colours. Now, a ‘Roller’ will be added to his fleet of fanciful cars that colours his compound in Ijebu Ode.  Some of the posh cars the Fuji exponent ownes includes: Cooper, Lexus SUV, Range Rover Sports, Bentley, Mercedes Benz (AMG) among a host of others all of which come with customised features and number plates.
