It appears BBNaija reality star, Tacha, may have entered into quite a number of bad books with some Nigerian celebrities who showed her support during her stay in the BBNaija house. One of them is Nollywood actress, Angela Okorie, who recently took to her Instagram page to lambast the TV reality star for being ungrateful to her despite all she went through to show her support during the BBNaija show. Sharing a video of a boy appreciating her, she wrote: “This Right Here keeps me going. What Ever I do for people. I don’t expect a payback And that is why God Keeps blessing me. But as a human being, I think I deserve gratitude. Some people I helped like Tacha can’t even say Thank you for giving her my platform To push her Brand.” Tacha ignores me, what an ungrateful personality. “As the matter of fact she ignores me. When I write her It takes 2 days to reply me Or she directs me to her manager. What an Ungrateful personality. Tacha it took you 2 weeks to call me after youLeft Big brother house, That was After hairess told u to call to at least say thank you, Now I understand why Jaruma unfollowed you. Tacha I told you to post her picture publicly and Say Thank you to her for all she did for you, Cos is not easy to spend money on who doesn’t Know u , Gratitude is important.” She said she told Tacha that a good character will keep her in the industry for a long time but a bad character will make her lose everything. According to her, she was the first public face to post Tacha’s picture when she entered the big brother house. “Desist from being Ungrateful to people who Helped you when u were a nobody Else it will Ruin You forever. NB: Gratitude is everything. Morning world.#Epaindem” the actress added.
