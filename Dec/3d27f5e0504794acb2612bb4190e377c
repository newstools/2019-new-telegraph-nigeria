The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) wants security agencies to question leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the killings and electoral violence that characterized the nation’s elections This, the party said, became necessary following revelations that certain APC leaders were allegedly behind the gruesome killings and bloody violence that marred the November 16 governorship and senatorial elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states.
PDP, in a statement Tuesday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbobdiyan expressed shock by attempts by the APC to dismiss nationwide calls for electoral reforms. The party noted that the spokesperson of the ruling party, Lanre Issa-Onilu, noted that no ‘”amount of reform” can help PDP’s outcry and demand for violence-free election in Nigeria. PDP said by interpreting national and international concerns over bloodletting and violence in our elections as PDP’s ‘malady’, the APC has further confirmed apprehensions that it is the mastermind of the horrific violence and forceful invasion of polling units to aid their rigging plots.
