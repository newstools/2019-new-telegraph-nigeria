Anthony Martial is set to miss Manchester United’s clash with Tottenham on Wednesday due to injury, according to reports. The 23-year-old was substituted for Mason Greenwood in the 82nd minute during United’s 2-2 draw with Aston Villa on Sunday, reports metro.co.uk. But instead of sitting on the bench for the remainder of the game, the French forward headed straight down the tunnel with his hand over his face. According to Sky Sports News, Martial suffered a muscular problem during that match and is struggling to overcome that problem in time for Spurs’ visit to Old Trafford on Wednesday evening. Martial has already missed eight games for United this season due to a hamstring injury, and he could now be facing another spell on the sidelines ahead of his side’s busy winter schedule. The report also claims that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is considering playing three central defenders against Jose Mourinho’s side – a formation he started with in United’s 3-3 draw against Sheffield United just over a week ago. Martial’s potential absence could mean that Marcus Rashford will spearhead United’s attack in a central role, while Jesse Lingard could deputise on the left flank. Solskjaer has guided United to just two wins in their last six Premier League matches and his side are already eight points behind fourth-placed Chelsea. Spurs, meanwhile, have won both of their Premier League games since Mourinho took over from Mauricio Pochettino last month. Wednesday’s fixture will be the first time Mourinho has returned to Old Trafford as a manager since he was sacked by United last December.
