It is no longer news that walking down the aisle means a couple will be married forever. This is even more obvious in the lives of some Nigerian celebrity couples whose marriages crashed soon after they were consummated. One of such celebrity couples is Nollywood actor, IK Ogbonna, and his Colombian ex-wife, Sonia La Reina. The duo has been the sweetheart in the entertainment industry at one time and the news of their split was not taken well by many fans. Their marriage produced a handsome son, Ace, as some fans still nurse hope that they would get back together. In a question and answer session hosted by Sonia on Instagram, a fan asked the Colombian beauty how she is coping with being a single mother. The pretty lady responded that she is actually enjoying every bit of it and she loves that she can move at her own pace because itâ€™s super fulfilling.
