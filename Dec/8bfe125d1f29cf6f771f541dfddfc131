Winner of Saturday’s Kogi West Senatorial rerun election, Senator Smart Adeyemi has described the tenure of the defeated Senator Dino Melaye, in the Red Chamber of the National Assembly, as a total waste and disaster. The Alll Progressives Congress (APC)’s Adeyemi, who was declared winner after the Court of Appeal ordered the rerun, polled 88, 373 votes to oust Melaye of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who got 62, 133 votes. Addressing journalists in on Sunday in Lokoja, the Kogi State capital, Adeyemi described Senator Dino Melaye as his “political boy”. He, however, promised to redeem the image of his constituency and the state in general. The Senator elect, while apologising on behalf of the Kogi West senatorial district to those Melaye had maligned during his period in the senate, claimed to have brought Melaye up in politics, but unfortunately he later turned against him. “Melaye’s era at the National Assembly was a disaster to the people of Kogi State and the nation in general. “Dino was insulting everyone that made him. Nobody is too big for him to insult; fighting people. So, I am apologising to Mr. President, Muhammadu Buhari, former President Olusegun Obasanjo, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Governor Yahaya Bello, all the security and institutions he insulted to forgive Dino and the Kogi West constituency. It is not in our character to be that reckless. “Dino stole the political garment of his master and anyone who steals his master’s dress before his maturity, will either wear an oversized garment,” he said. Adeyemi thanked the APC for their support, just as he commended Governor Yahaya Bello for making the party very strong in the state.
