Former President of the Senate, Senator David Mark, has urged Nigerians to use this period of the yuletide to pray for the peace and unity of the nation in order to overcome the myriads of socio-economic and political problems confronting the country. According to a statement by Paul Mumeh, his Media Assistant, “Mark believes that with prayers, commitment and honesty of purpose, Nigeria can surmount the challenges even as he submits that the problems are useful lessons for greater future if we learn from it.”  Addressing pilgrims to Jerusalem at St. Mulumba Catholic chaplaincy, Abuja, before their departure to the Holy land yesterday, Mark told them to put Nigeria first saying, “the nation needs divine intervention to conquer her problems.”  He, however, reminded those in authorities to ensure justice and fairness in all their dealings because justice and equity would only promote peace and unity. He counseled the pilgrims to be good ambassadors of Nigeria in the Holy land by obeying the laws of the host nation. Mark reminded the Pilgrims that going to Jerusalem, was primarily a religious obligation and not an opportunity to engage in commerce or buying and selling. He warned against absconding from the Holy land, saying that the consequences of such action would be unimaginable. Earlier in his homily, the Chaplain of St. Mulumba Catholic Chaplaincy, Rev. Fr. Innocent Jooji, told the Pilgrims to be guided by rules of pilgrimage, stating that “it is purely a religious experience to strengthen our faith in God.”
