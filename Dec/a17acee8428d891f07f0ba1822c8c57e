A 22-year-old man, Amusa Hammed, has been arrested for allegedly impregnating a minor at the Bariga area of Lagos State and compelling her to abort it.  The incident happened on December 6, at No. 7 Dassy Castro, off Odunsi Street, Bariga. It was gathered that Hammed, after impregnating the girl, caused her to carry out an abortion.  Hammed was arrested after Bariga Police Station received a complaint about him, leading to the minor being taken to Mirabel Center Ikeja, for medical treatment and forensic examination. The medical report showed that she had an abortion. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Bala Elkana said that Hammed has confessed to detectives from ‘Family Support Unit’ that he carried out the abortion with the assistance of a nurse.  Elkana, however, said that the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, has ordered that the suspect be charged to Court.
