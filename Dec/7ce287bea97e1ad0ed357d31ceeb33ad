A 28-year-old female fruit seller, identified as Joy Osain, has allegedly killed herself by drinking a poisonous substance suspected to be Sniper. The late Osain, a source in Azikoro village where the incident happened, said she was residing with Eze Augustus the boyfriend before the unfortunate incident happened. The source, who did not want his name mentioned, told New Telegraph that contrary to the allegation that the man beat the lady to death, the lady felt bad because the man brought in another lady into the house where they were living together. The source, who took New Telegraph to a corner before speaking, said: “See, I have to tell you the truth because I know you. The lady drank Sniper because she found out that the boyfriend brought in another lady who was incidentally the girlfriend of her lover into the house. “They started quarrelling and she drank Sniper. As at when Joy fell on the floor outside and died, the boyfriend was not even around. They called him and told him. He now ran to the police station to report. “The relatives of the girl came and destroyed the boy’s house saying that he beat their sister to death.” When Sunday Telegraph visited the family of the deceased at Agbura community where the late girl hailed from, the father, Chief Abida, who was visibly pained, said: “I don’t have anything to say now. How can they still arrest three persons that went to take my daughter to the mortuary after the death of my daughter? “If they didn’t arrest them, I would have let go but now they are in detention. Please I don’t have anything to say. I’m sorry.”
