This is due to the strategic importance they attach to Lagos route. The Chief Executive Officer of the airline, Shal Weiss, made the disclosure when he visited Nigeria. Weiss was in Nigeria as part of the airline’s strategic growth to reposition and consolidate on its lucrative London-Lagos route. which was launched 18 years ago and to hold business meetings with airline strategic partners. He told New Telegraph that the airline customers were going to enjoy incentives, stressing that Virgin Atlantic had returned to profitability and ready to launch more routes to South America. The airline, according to him, is already phasing out its iconic B747 and A340 airplanes, which it hitherto deployed on the London-Lagos route. His words: “The plans are to retire the old planes like B747 and A340 for the new ones that are coming. B747 by the way has been a fantastic plane. Everybody loves the B747. The passengers absolutely love it especially the upper deck but it has been 50 years that it has been flying and there are new technologies, better planes, more efficient, more noise efficient and we are moving to those. We are not saying we have been operating B747 for 50 years. We retired one actually last week.” Asked if the carrier was looking at expansion into more cities in Nigeria, the airline chief  said his company was in growth mode not only in Nigeria where they have made some strides but expanding to other cities like Tel Aviv, increasing its flights to Mumbai and opening up services to South America.
