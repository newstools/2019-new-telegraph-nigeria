Boris Johnson’s Conservatives have won an outright majority in the Commons after securing 326 seats. The Tory leader will remain prime minister and lead the Government, commanding more than half of the seats necessary to do so. He looks set to achieve the party’s biggest election win since Margaret Thatcher was in charge, with his election gamble paying off and teeing him up to push through his Brexit deal, reports standard.co.uk. The Conservatives are on 338 seats at time of writing. Speaking after retaining his seat earlier, the prime minister said: “It does look as though this One Nation Conservative government has been given a powerful new mandate to get Brexit done.” Johnson’s success, which looks to mark the biggest Tory majority since 1987, was teamed with crushing outings for the other main party leaders. Jeremy Corbyn has announced he will stand down as Labour leader, while Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson lost her seat. Meanwhile, Downing Street said in a statement that if the exit poll was correct, and Mr Johnson was returned to Downing Street, there will be a minor cabinet reshuffle on Monday. The Withdrawal Agreement Bill, paving the way for Brexit on January 31, would have its second Commons reading on Friday, December 20. A major reshuffle would take place in February, after the UK has left the EU, No 10 added, with a Budget statement in March.
