Kelechi Iheanacho continued his revival after he shone again as Leicester City recorded their eighth straight English Premier League win courtesy of a 4-1 win at Aston Villa.  Iheanacho scored a goal and provided an assist, just as he had done in the dramatic win against Everton.  The striker, who started his first EPL game this season at Villa, first set up Jamie Vardy to open scoring in the 20th minute, before he himself netted from the first post on 41 minutes.  He has now scored two goals and provided two assists in the league.  It is the form that originally got Leicester to splash 25 million pounds on him. Leicester City remain second on the table with 38 points from 16 matches, eight points behind leaders Liverpool.
