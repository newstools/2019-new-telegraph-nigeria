When the year approaches the end, Christmas décor will be everywhere to set the mood for the Christmas celebration.  Rather than going in all traditional Christmas décor, do something different and unique this year by going green this season. Red and green have been representing Christmas since, like, forever, but there is a little bit more you can do when it comes to your Christmas holiday colour palette. Get a little more creative this year and spread the holiday cheer to a few other colour schemes.  Green, metallics, and bright, unexpected hues are just as festive, and way more fun. You can add green to your home in many different ways. Whether it’s in bright, bold statements or as a subtle touch in a rustic pattern, green will give your space energetic festive vibes.   An effortless wat to introduce green into your interiors is by adding velvet throw pillows to your living room. Velvet has been back for a while now but decorators still can’t get enough of it. Tactile and durable with a hint of decadence, the texture will instantly turn your room from drab to fab.  At its most vamp-like, green velvet brings a touch of gothic glamour to the home but it can be found in every colour imaginable to effortlessly blend with your interior. So this season why not try some pastel velvet accessories?
