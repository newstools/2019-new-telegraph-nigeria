 S uper Eagles striker Victor Osimhen has said he is delighted Lille celebrated their 75th birthday with a win to end a four-game winless run.  More than 40,000 fans were at the stadium when Osimhen fired his eighth French Ligue 1 goal in first-half stoppage time from the penalty spot and this proved to be the match winner for Lille against Dijon. “I am happy for this win,” the Super Eagles striker said.  “It was an important win because we had gone without a win in three, four games. “It was important to give the fans this win and a good fight.” Last season’s runners-up are now seventh on the table with 22 points from 15 matches, 11 points behind leaders PSG.
