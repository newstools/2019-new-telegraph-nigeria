The FCT Ministerial Traffic Task Team has issued a seven-day ultimatum to operators of illegal motor parks in Kubwa area to relocate. Chairman of the team, Mr Ikharo Attah, gave the ultimatum after a meeting with the motor park owners and traders. Attah said that the measure was to ensure sanity in and around Kubwa, which was one of the populated Abuja outskirts. Attah told operators of the park that the exercise was not a plan to hurt them but to ensure free flow of traffic in line with the FCT Minister, Muhammad Bello’s plan to ease traffic logjam in Abuja. “We are carrying out a total clean up of Kubwa town: illegal motor parks will not be allowed to remain. We want the people to have and enjoy a special motor park terminal.” “The continued trading on the road corridors in Kubwa is causing grilock in the axis and must be addressed. “This is a major clean up of Kubwa town; you can see sundry nuisance all over. The exercise is all about sanity and not to hurt anyone.” Mr Bello Kaka, Head of Enforcement, Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB), in a remark, said that there was no going back on the exercise. Kaka said that the board would soon start prosecuting those that failed to obey the extant laws. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that the team held sensitisation meetings at NYSC junction, Kubwa, NNPC and Oando filling stations, Maitama Ultra modern market and Dutsen-Alhaji market gate.
