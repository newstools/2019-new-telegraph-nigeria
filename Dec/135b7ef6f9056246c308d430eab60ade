According to the organisers, the awards follow  the lender’s noticeable efforts at implementing notable HR practices and being unbiased in its approach to personnel management in the banking sector and in the country at large. Delivering his speech at the event, a former Chairman/Managing Director of Mobile Oil Nigeria Plc, Mr. Olu Onakoya,  emphasised the evolution that had taken place in HR practices in the modern age. He said that gone were the days when the HR profession was only saddled with the responsibility of hiring and firing employees, adding that the contemporary HR department oversees all things related to managing an organisation’s most important asset — its human capital. He further explained that today’s HR department is also responsible for fostering a positive work environment through effective employee-employer relations, engagement, and education. While appreciating the organisers of the award, Olufunke Amobi, Country Head Human Capital, Stanbic IBTC Holdings PLC, commended the efforts of the Stanbic IBTC team for their great contribution to the success of the organisation.
