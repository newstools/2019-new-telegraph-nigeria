A notorious armed robber, Sampson Iheukwumere Nwokocha, aka, Grave, who has been terrorizing residents of Umuahia, the Abia State capital, was yesterday afternoon gunned down by a tactical team from the state police command. Nwokocha, an ex-convict, was killed in a hideout at Ossah Mgbaja in Umuahia North council area. Thousands of people gathered to take a glimpse of the corpse at the Abia State Police Command headquarters, Bende Road, Umuahia.  The ring believed to be the source of his invincibility, which, however, failed him, was placed on his chest close to the bullet hole, which made its way straight to his heart. No member of his gang was caught with him. He was found alone and shot. The police had been on his trail until yesterday.  New Telegraph gathered that the arrest and detention of Sampson’s mother, believed to be behind him, at the Correctional Center, Afara, made his arrest easy.  Speaking on the incident, the State Commissioner of Police, Mr Ene Okon, said it was Nwokocha who led a robbery gang on November 6 to invade Hotel Helson, Umuahia, to rob staff and guests, “during which one of the policemen on duty was shot dead and his rifle carted away.”  Okon further disclosed that “also on November 10, 2019 himself and his gang robbed the attendants and customers of Forte Oil service station along Bank Road, Umuahia.” The commissioner also said: “On different occasions he led a gang that snatched vehicles within and outside the capital city, Umuahia. “Today in an encounter with a tactical team of the command, he was caught up by superior fire power of the team.”  Okon, who said the police acted on a tip off, appealed to members of the public to avail the police with information to help arrest of criminal elements.
