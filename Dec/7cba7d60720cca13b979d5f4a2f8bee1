The chances of Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka of making it to the Super Eagles are slim as the Nigeria Football Federation is not keen on moving for him. Saka has given hints regarding his desire to play his international football for Nigeria despite featuring for England at the junior levels. The starlet who broke into the Gunners first team this season is hoping he can follow in the footsteps of Alex Iwobi who pledged his allegiance to the country of his parents and became a mainstay of the Nigerian team. However, the 19-year-old said in a recent interview that Nigeria was yet to contact him on the possibility of changing his nationality and our correspondent reliably learnt that the NFF would not  make a move for him now because eggheads at the Glasshouse believe the winger is not ripe enough for the Eagles. A senior member of the Super Eagles backroom staff  told Operanews that although there could be moves for the winger in the future, the general feelings among the chieftains including coach Gernot Rohr is that he should be allowed to continue his development at Arsenal as it would be too early to rush him into international football. ’’There are so many players of Nigerian descent that we are looking at and Saka is one of them,” the source said. “However, a move for Arsenal starlet is not the priority now because we have some players in the team who are also technically gifted. With due respect to Saka, players like Samuel Chukwueze, Samuel Kalu and even Moses Simon who are playing ssame roles as him are doing well now; and it is hard to believe that the Arsenal player is better than them. He’s still young; he still has plenty of time and Rohr really likes him but he feels it is not time to bring him in.”
