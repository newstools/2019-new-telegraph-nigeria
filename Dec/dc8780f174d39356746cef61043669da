President Muhammadu Buhari has sent a message of congratulations to Anthony Joshua following his victory over Andy Ruiz Jr, which ensured he regained his world boxing titles which he lost to the Mexican six months ago. Buhari, speaking through his Special Adviser Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said he was saluting Joshua for bringing joy to millions of Nigerians at home and in the Diaspora, who had rooted for him to regain the titles he lost about six months ago. In a tweet on the verified Government of Nigeria Twitter handle, the President said: “The downfall of a man is truly not the end of his life. There’s always another, and better day. This is a lesson we must all learn from you as a country.” Adesina’s tweet concluded by adding: “He wishes @anthonyfjoshua well as he seeks to bring more glory to Nigeria, and to the boxing profession.” Saturday’s night win meant Joshua became a two-time word heavyweight champion by exacting revenge over Ruiz Jr in dominant fashion with a unanimous points victory in a tense rematch in Saudi Arabia. Six months on from the night where Ruiz stunned boxing, Joshua risked his career being left in tatters with a second defeat but served up 36 minutes of movement and well-timed punching to take the IBF, WBA and WBO titles back to Britain, reports the BBC. After cutting his Mexican rival inside the first round he simply never looked back and picked out smart jabs and right hands throughout before being serenaded with chants of “AJ, AJ, AJ” by the 14,000 or so fans in the largely full Diriyah Arena. Ruiz never looked close to landing a knockdown and when scores of 118-110 118-110 and 119-109 were read out, Joshua jumped up and down in the ring in celebration, just as the man who had wrecked his US debut did in June.
