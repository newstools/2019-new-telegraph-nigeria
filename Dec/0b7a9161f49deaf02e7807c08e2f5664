The brewing industry has continued to struggle with operations as the harsh business environment confines International Breweries Plc to a loss position. Chris Ugwu reports   T hough Nigeria’s beer industry is a very vital component of the non-oil sector, which has largely contributed to economic growth in recent times, various factors have interfered to alter the dynamics of the alcoholic beverage market. Notable among the changes to the architecture of alcohol business in the country is the rise to prominence of new variants of alcoholic drinks, which mixes bitters with spirit.   For instance, the introduction of Alomo Bitters produced by a Ghanaian company,  Kasapreko Limited, in Accra, led the charge of this category of beverages, thereby, making the market share of all other alcoholic brands to be re-configured as the beer brands suffered significant market loss.   This is why the financial results of most of the companies in the sector have continued to dwindle in the past few years.  Despite hopes that subsequent results would be brighter enough to erase the negatives in the accounts, the trend has continued with the increased excise duty duties and other challenges. International Breweries Plc like its peers has continued to struggle for better performance but in spite of its innovative and proactive responses to market dynamics and competitive pressures, the company has remained at a loss position. Its share price movement has also ebbed and remain susceptible to the challenges facing manufacturing businesses in Nigeria. Financials  For the nine months ended September 2018, the company reported a loss after tax of N7.137 billion as against a profit of N1.429 billion posted in 2017.  Cost of sales stood at N54.591 billion from N20.234 billion in 2017. However, revenue rose to N83.346 billion in 2018 from N36.527 billion in 2017. According to analysts at FBNQuest, “International Breweries’ (IB) Q3 2018 (end-Sep) results were broadly behind our estimates. Sales for the quarter surprised positively (+13 per cent) but this was more than offset by a 500bp underperformance in EBIT margin. Consequently, Q3 pre-tax losses were 83 per cent worse than forecast.   “Although IB’s sales have lately been driven by additional volumes coming from its recently-commissioned Sagamu plant, margins remain under pressure. Of more concern, the company’s performance has not lived up to post-merger projections, as expected synergies have failed to materialise. Indeed, published results post-merger suggest that inefficiencies may be coming from Pabod and/or Intafact, and these are weighing on combined earnings.   “Given Q3 results, we have made significant cuts to our earnings estimates over the 2018-20E period and revised our price target downwards by around 34 per cent to N31.1. Year to date, IB shares have lost -43.6 per cent, worse than the broad index which is down -19.6 per cent. From current levels, the shares show an upside potential of +7 per cent to our fair value estimate. That said, considering our negative outlook on earnings over our forecast period, we retain our Neutral rating on the stock.   “International Breweries Plc. reported a loss after tax of N3.866 billion for the financial year ended December 31, 2018 as against loss of N1.395 billion posted during the period ended December 2017. Loss before tax equally stood at N8.049 billion during the period under review from N3.233 billion during the comparable period of 2017.” Revenue, however, grew to N120.610 billion during the period from N36.527 billion in 2017, amounting to 230 per cent increase, while cost of sales grew to 221 per cent to N73.270 billion from N22.819 billion in 2017. International Breweries Plc. reported a loss after tax of N3.987 billion during the first quarter ended March 2019, from N2.240 billion loss reported in March 2018. Loss before tax stood at N5.085 billion for the first quarter as against loss of N2.557 billion posted in March 2018.   Revenue dropped by 39 per cent to N36.096 billion in 2019 from N25.966 billion recorded earlier while cost of sales stood at N22.609 billion from N15.857 billion in 2018, accounting for 42.58 per cent increase. The brewer reported a loss after tax of N6.84 billion for the half year ended June 30, 2019, from N2.846 billion loss reported in June 2018.  Loss before tax stood at N10.526 billion for the half year as against loss of N5.242 billion posted in 2018.  However, revenue grew by 29.22 per cent to N68.630 billion in 2019 from N53.109 billion recorded earlier but cost of sales stood at N45.437 billion from N32.198 billion in 2018, accounting for 41.12 per cent increase. International Breweries sustained the loss position during the third quarter as it reported a loss after tax of N16.445 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, from N7.137 billion loss reported in September 2018. Loss before tax stood at N24.076 billion for the Q3 as against loss of N9.014 billion posted in 2018.   However, revenue grew by 16.69 per cent to N97.260 billion in 2019 from N83.346 billion recorded earlier but cost of sales stood at N66.138 billion from N51.114 billion in 2018, accounting for 29.39 per cent increase. Earnings’ deflators   Analysts at CSL Research, while reacting to the nine months figures, said revenue dipped 14.6 per cent q/q to N28.6 billion on the back of fewer festivities within the quarter. They added that revenue was also down in Q2 2019 compared to Q1 2019.This according to them may signal a slowdown in revenue growth for IntBrew who is eroding competitors’ market share using discount pricing strategy.   They noted that the growth in Cost of Sales was driven by a 28.0 per cent growth in raw material cost which is faster than the growth in revenue which implies increasing cost per unit.   “We believe the growing cost is due to higher barley prices. Consequently, Gross margin declined, down 5.4ppts y/y to 43.4 per cent. Nevertheless, Gross profit was up 3.8 per cent y/y to N42.2 billion in nine months 2019 from N40.7 billion in nine months 2018 while it dipped 22.3 per cent q/q to N11.0 billion in Q3 2019.   “Operating Expenses grew significantly, up 33.1 per cent y/y to N33.1 billion in 9M 2019. The rise in Opex was driven by surge in Marketing & Promotion Expenses (up 36.0 per cent y/y) and administrative expenses adjusted for depreciation (up 27.3 per cent y/y).   “Furthermore, Depreciation Expense grew significantly, up 61.5 per cent y/y to N20.3bn in 9M 2019 from N12.6bn in 9M 2018. We note the jump in depreciation expense is due to the commencement of booking depreciation charge on property, plant and equipment associated with the opening of the Sagamu plant. These assets were previously classified as assets in course of construction and were not depreciated. against this backdrop, IntBrew recorded a loss before interest and tax of N10.9 billion in 9 months 2019.   “IntBrew’s bloated debt book continues to pressure earnings as Net Finance cost increased 45.8 per cent y/y to N13.1 billion in nine months 2019 from N9.0 billion in nine months  2018. The company took additional short-term debt of N29.0 billion in nine months 2019, bringing outstanding long-term debt obligation to N153.5 billion and debt to equity to a precarious 13.0x. Consequently, loss before tax worsened to N24.1 billion in nine months 2019 from N9.2 billion in 9M 2018 while a tax credit of N7.6 billion cushioned loss after tax to N16.4 billion,” they said.   Looking forward Addressing shareholders at the 41 Annual General Meeting  (AGM), Chairman of the company,  Sunday Akintoye Omole, said: “We remain optimistic for the outlook for 2018 and beyond. We will continue to develop and differentiate our brand portfolios, taking opportunities to grow sales and improve our mix. With the exciting news of our Sagamu brewery coming on line mid-year 2018, we will have capacity to continue our expansion plans. “Focus will be maintained on cost effectiveness and synergy delivery. Healthy cash generation will again be a priority. We will target investments in production capacity, marketing and sales capability and business systems in order to drive medium-term growth.”  According to analysts at FBNQuest, due to improved FX liquidity, “we believe there is limited risk of additional FX losses in the near term. We also expect the company to benefit from improved cost synergies following the merger. “We have forecast PBT margin to average around 17 per cent over the 2017-19E period compared with 8 per cent recorded in FY 2017(end-Mar). We see EPS growth of 33 per cent y/y on average over the same period. “Looking ahead, we see IB continuing to undercut competitors in its attempt to gain more market share. We also expect that it will aggressively push more of its brands into the Lagos market (an important market for the Brewers) following increased capacity at Sagamu.   “We, however, see IB’s price competition coming at the expense of margins, which are already constrained. In our view, to ease pressure on bottom line, IB’s management may need to take further steps to reduce expensive debt and/or shift to equity sources of financing.”   Last line Though high cost of operations has significantly weighed down on the real sector of the economy, it is expedient for the brewer to continue to manage its cost base tightly to deliver moderate operating margin improvement for growth and profitability.
