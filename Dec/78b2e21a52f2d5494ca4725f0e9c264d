P lateau State Governor and Chairman, Northern Governors’ Forum (NGF), Simon Lalong, has directed security agencies in the state to deal decisively with anyone found disturbing the peace of the state or engaged in any criminal activity during the Christmas and New Year celebrations.   Lalong spoke yesterday during the 2019 Christmas Carol held at the Government House Chapel, Rayfield, Jos.  He warned those he described as trouble-makers and war merchants that they would be dealt with decisively if found disturbing the peace of the state or engaged in any criminal activity.   According to him, peace had been restored in the state and that it was the duty to all to protect and preserve it at all cost.   He called on all citizens to go about their celebrations freely, but with utmost vigilance so as to report any suspected criminal to the security agencies for prompt action.  “As a government, we are continuing our rescue mission by implementing our three-pillar policy vision that is anchored on peace, security and good governance; infrastructural development and sustainable economic rebirth.   “We shall therefore continue to count on your prayers; support and constructive criticisms to enable us discharge this burden with all our energy.  “I assure you that we will continue to administer the state with the fear of God and carry everyone along according to our oath of office.  Lalong also called on Christians on the Plateau to continue to be the light and reflect the essence of the birth of Christ the saviour in all their actions and interactions.  “Let us promote and practice peace because it is central to our development. We have to build on the successes that we have achieved so far and ensure that the ugly past is truly behind us.  He, however, called on Christians in the state not to keep the joy and pleasures of the season to themselves alone, but to reach out and share with others, particularly the less privileged and those of other faiths.
