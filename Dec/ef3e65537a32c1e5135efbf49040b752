An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court yesterday sentenced a 24-year-old man, Innocent Ahuwuanya, to two months imprisonment for stealing a mobile phone valued at N65,000. Chief Magistrate, G. O Anifowose, ordered that Ahuwuanya should serve his term at Kirikiri Correctional Centre after he pleaded guilty to a charge of stealing. Anifowose sentenced the convict without giving an option of fine. “I hope this will serve as deterrent to others who intend to commit such crime,” she said. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Sergeant Felicia Okwori, told the court that Ahuwuanya committed the offence on 18th of June, at Crest Inn Hotel,  Balogun Street, Oshodi, Lagos. Okwori said that Ahuwuanya stole the Infinix Hot 5 mobile phone from where it was being charged at the reception of the hotel. “He was arrested when the CCTV footage camera at the reception was reviewed,” the prosecutor said. The offence contravened Section 287 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
