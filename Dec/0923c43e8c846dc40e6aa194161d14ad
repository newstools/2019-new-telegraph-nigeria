OPPORTUNITY Cocoa traders in Nigeria have exploited the challenges faced by their competitors to maximise price  I ncidence of high  black pod disease in Ghana and the introduction of cocoa price floor by Cote D’Ivoire and Ghana earlier in the year have paved the way for Nigerian cocoa in the global market.   The two neighbouring countries had agreed to a premium price for their cocoa with buyers early in the year before they were ensnared by the problems.   Because of the challenges faced by the leading producers of the beans, Nigeria is expected to realise N220.5 billion from cocoa proceeds at the international market this year following the inability of the neighbouring countries to sell the bad beans through trans-border shipment to Nigeria due to border closure.  According to the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) in its forecast, the country’s cocoa output is estimated at  245,000 tonnes for 2019 season.  The prices of cocoa beans in October 2019 increased from N650, 000 per tonne at farm gate to between  N720, 000 and N900, 000 per tonnes at the peak of the season.  Findings revealed that Malaysia and The Netherlands have turned to Nigeria to buy some fermented cocoa beans valued at N8.3 billion within the last few months.  Nigeria has  exported some cocoa beans valued at N6.2 billion to Netherland and  N2.1 billion to Malaysia in the last two months.  Some of the beans are exported through the Lagos Port Complex and Port and Terminal Multi-services Limited (PTML) of Tincan Island Port.  In the 2019/2020 season, AFEX Cocoa Outlook explained that some international buyers had entered into partnerships with traders to aggregate volumes of cocoa from the Nigeria.  It said: “There is an increasing demand for Nigerian cocoa in the international market stemming from the envisaged shortfall of cocoa from Ghana as a result of the black pod disease which plagued the crop.  “Some volumes are, however, being transacted in the market with a number of aggregators utilising mechanical dryers to achieve acceptable moisture levels.”  The company further explained that a number of large multinational firms had commenced purchasing, saying that there would  be a differential of up to 40 per cent between opening season price and peak season price per tonne at farm gate.  Before the new development in West African cocoa market, ICCO had explained that out of the global output of 4.83 million tonnes, African countries were projected to export 3.67million tonnes this year.  It stated in July 2019 that Cameroon was expected to produce 250,000 tonnes; Côte d’Ivoire,  2.15 million tonnes; Ghana, 900,000 tonnes and Nigeria, 245,000 tonnes.   Further, the organisation noted that the demand for the beans had recorded growth by 3.4 per cent to 4.75 million tonnes  In 2018, domestic price of the beans in Nigeria increased by 21 per cent despite the  output, which  dwindled by seven per cent.  Within the period, price per metric tonne rose from between N580,000 and N600,000  to N821,520.  Also, between January and October, 2018, cocoa price surged by 43 per cent because of dryness and fungi plaguing the crops in other West African countries, which accounts for over two-thirds of global supplies.
