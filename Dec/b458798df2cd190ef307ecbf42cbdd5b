Barely a week after an officer of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LSMA) was stoned to death; six officers of the Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC) were allegedly stabbed and injured by the staff and touts working around the Federal High Court, Ikoyi. New Telegraph learnt that the officers were attacked while trying to arrest street traders and confiscate goods and items that allegedly displayed and sell on the walkways in front of the court along Queens Drive in Ikoyi in compliance with the governorâ€™s directive on street trading. It was gathered that during the exercise, staff of the Federal High Court, who were known to patronise the street traders, allegedly prevented the officers from arresting the traders which led to the bloody clash between the staff of the Federal High Court and other touts said to be working near the premises. Speaking on the mayhem, the Deputy Corps Marshal in Charge of Operations Mr. Ganiu Kazeem, explained that the team arrived at the scene of the incident at about 1:45 pm but were attacked by staff of the Federal High Court with the support of private security personnel, hurling stones, iron rods, broken bottles and cutlasses and leaving members of the enforcement team injured. According to him, the operation had nothing to do with the staff of the Court but it was discovered that the hawkers were paying rent to the private security of the Court thereby necessitating the intervention by court personnel. The Deputy Corp Marshal confirmed that some of suspects were arrested during the fracas, while the case was also immediately reported at the Ikoyi Police Station for further investigation, advising Lagosians to comply with the laws on street trading as the government would no longer tolerate the slightest attack on any enforcement personnel.
