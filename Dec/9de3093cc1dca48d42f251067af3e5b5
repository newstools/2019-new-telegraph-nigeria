Gunmen numbering over 20 in the early hours of friday attacked a Kaduna community and abducted a pregnant woman, simply identified as Mrs. Okeke and two children. The attack took place in Juji, a suburb of Kaduna metropolis, Chikun Local Government Area of the state. The gunmen were said to have arrived the community about 1am and started shooting sporadically into the air. Residents who were sleeping woke up to the sound of gunshots even as many others took to their heels, running into the bush for cover. A resident of the area said that there was pandemonium across the community as a result of the attack. The gunmen were said to have moved into the residence of the pregnant woman, who is a mother of three and forcefully dragged her out of the compound. The husband of the woman was said to have travelled. A 12 year old boy was also abducted with his mother who was recuperating from injuries she sustained from a motorcycle accident recently. She was, however, abandoned when she could not cope with the long distance trek in the bush following injuries from the accident. The woman was said to have found her way home later in the day. While a nine-year-old girl was also said to have been abducted by the bandits. A resident disclosed that: “We heard shots around 1 am and all of us ran in different directions. Many people ran into the bush, others hid around their compounds. “I ran to a nearby bush and hid until they left before I came out. It was this morning that we discovered that they left with the nineyear- old girl and the son of the woman who was abandoned but was able to find her way back to Juji this morning.” The police were said to have visited the area yesterday morning to assess the situation of things. But when contacted, the spokesman for the Kaduna State Police Command, Yakubu Sabo, said he learnt there was an incident in the area and promised to get the details of what transpired.
