The US House Judiciary Committee has approved two impeachment charges against President Donald Trump, moving the process towards a full House vote. The articles, backed by Democrats and opposed by Republicans, are expected to be voted on by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives next week. Trump is the fourth US president in history to face impeachment, reports the BBC. Speaking to reporters at the White House, he again dismissed the process as a “sham” and a “hoax”. Friday’s hearing lasted just over ten minutes before the two articles of impeachment – abuse of power and obstructing Congress – were passed by 23 votes to 17. The vote had been expected on Thursday but was delayed after more than 14 hours of rancorous debate. Republicans criticised that decision by Democratic Party Chairman Jerry Nadler, accusing him of pushing back the vote to ensure more TV coverage. In the abuse of power article, Trump is accused of soliciting a foreign country to help him politically by trying to force Ukraine to launch a corruption investigation into his political rival Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential contender. He is also accused of obstructing Congress by failing to co-operate with the House investigation. Leading Democrats agreed the articles of impeachment described over nine pages. They say that Trump “betrayed the nation” by acting “corruptly”. Nadler made a brief statement to reporters after the vote, calling it a “solemn and sad day” and pledged that the House of Representatives would “act expeditiously”. But Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz said: “For Democrats, impeachment is their drug.” Speaking from the White House Oval Office alongside the president of Paraguay, Trump called the impeachment process “a witch hunt”, “a sham” and “a hoax”. He said Democrats were “trivialising impeachment” adding that they are “making absolute fools out of themselves”. “It’s a sad thing for this country, but seems to be very good for me politically,” he added.
