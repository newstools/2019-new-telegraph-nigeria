Gianluigi Buffon drew level with Paolo Maldini in the all-time Serie A appearances chart as Juventus climbed back to the top of the league with a 2-1 win at Sampdoria. The 41-year-old has now made 647 appearances in Italy’s top flight. He also moved ahead of Alessandro del Piero as Juve’s all-time record appearance maker on 479 matches, reports the BBC. Paulo Dybala and Cristiano Ronaldo were on the scoresheet as Juve moved three points clear of Inter Milan. Dybala opened the scoring in the 19th minute with a sumptuous volley from the right-hand corner of the box. Gianluca Caprari equalised before Ronaldo scored the winner with a header at the back post. Caprari was sent off in stoppage time for his second bookable offence. Buffon started his career at Parma, where he won the UEFA Cup and Coppa Italia in 1999 before moving to Juventus two years later. In Turin, he won nine Serie A titles, the Coppa Italia four times and finished runner-up in the Champions League twice under Massimiliano Allegri. He left for Paris St-Germain in 2018, winning the Ligue 1 title in his only season in the French capital, before returning to Juventus. The former Italy captain, who won the World Cup in 2006, also holds the appearance record for his national team, with 176 caps between 1997-2018.
