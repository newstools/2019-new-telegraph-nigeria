Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCCC), Ibadan zonal office, yesterday, stormed a Lagos hotel believed to be a hideout for Internet fraudsters and arrested a Yahoo kingpin as well as 26 others. The target of the operation was Rasaq Balogun, a suspected Internet fraud kingpin, whose illicit activities had dominated intelligence gathered from the recently arrested ‘police spies’ during a raid on their Abeokuta base. According to findings, Balogun harboured an army of young men recruited to carry out financial frauds through the use of the Internet. Some others were also arrested at his Beckley Estate residence, also in Lagos State. The raid on his hotel, Modzak Hotel, located at Abule-Egba, Lagos State, sufficiently gave credence to the suspicion as a retinue of young men were caught living in his hotel with no specific mission. The suspected kingpin and 26 other young men, between ages 18 and 35, were arrested at the scene. Some others were also arrested and brought to the Commission’s Ibadan zonal office for further interrogation. According to reports, officers of the anti-graft agency also recovered three vehicles, fetish items, laptops, mobile phones and documents suspected to contain fraudulent data from the suspect. The EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, said that the suspects would be charged to court.
