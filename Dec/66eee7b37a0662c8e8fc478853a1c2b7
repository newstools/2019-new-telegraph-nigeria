 T he Ilorin Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arrested three persons, including a Vice-Principal, for allegedly collecting money from students participating in the on-going National Examination Council (NECO) at Government Day Secondary School, Ote in Eiye-Nkorin Area of Kwara State.  The suspects are the Vice- Principal of the school, Issa Abdulrahman, a teacher, Usman Lanre Kayode and a supervisor of the examination in the centre, Saka Isiaka.  The Commission received an intelligence report that the school management and supervisor of the centre were extorting money from the students writing NECO in order to assist them in the examination. It was further gathered that the principal of the school allegedly used to separate the students during the examination. He allegedly used to place students that paid money in a classroom, and those that didn’t in another. Trouble started after an operative of the Commission, who dressed in a casual manner on 6th of December, pretending to be a passer-by, spied what was going on.  An iPad containing answers to all the questions was recovered from the suspects.  The suspects, according to the EFCC, would soon be charged to court.
