Margaret Saffold was found by cops with multiple gunshot wounds inside the pair’s Maywood home about 1 p.m. Sunday, NBC Chicago reported. She was declared dead at the scene. Her 76-year-old husband, James Delane, was also found inside the house with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head, the report said.
