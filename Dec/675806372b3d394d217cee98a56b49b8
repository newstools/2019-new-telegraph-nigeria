A mother was jailed after her toddler put a loaded gun he thought was his water pistol into his mouth and shot himself dead. Melissa Michelle Adamson, 33, was jailed for 24 years Monday over the negligence death of two year-old Lokhi Bloom at his Colorado Springs home in October 2018. Lokhi loved playing with his water squirt gun, and is believed to have mistaken the unsecured pink pistol for one of his toys at the time of the tragedy. Adamson, who is a recovering crystal meth addict, told cops afterwards that she’d loaded her .380 Ruger following a ‘threatening visit’ from a drug dealer called Beast. She was too high at the time to realize what was going on, but later tried to blame Lokhi’s dad, who now lives in Chicago, for the horrific tragedy. Adamson claimed to have left the gun in her office and gone into her garage to call her sister. She said she then heard a bang and returned to the house to find Lokhi mortally wounded. Attempts to revive the toddler were unsuccessful, and he was pronounced dead shortly after. During a search of Adamson’s home, police also found an ax, drug paraphernalia and two toy guns that Lokhi regularly played with. The killer mom admitted child abuse resulting in death in September, the ‘Colorado Springs-Gazette’ reported. She also pleaded guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a minor after admitting giving weed to two children. Adamson struck a plea deal which agreed a sentence of between 16 and 26 years, with sentencing Judge Lin Billings Vela handing out close to the maximum stretch available.
