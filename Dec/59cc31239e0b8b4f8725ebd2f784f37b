The traditional ruler of Afaraukwu autonomous community, Eze Israel Okwu Kanu and the father of leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, has died. Eze Kanu’s death was announced Friday afternoon by the traditional ruler of the neighbouring Okwulagha Afaraukwu, Eze Eddie Ibeabuchi on behalf of the Afaraukwu traditional rulers’ council. Eze Kanu died three months after the death of his wife, Ugoeze Sally Kanu, who died on August 30 in a German hospital and is yet to be buried. The news of Eze Kanu’s death, who was said to be in critical health condition at the time of the wife’s death, was confirmed by his second son and Kanu’s younger sibling, Emmanuel Kanu. Reacting, the Abia State government through the Commissioner for Information described the death as a rude shock. “It was with rude shock that we learnt of the passing on of one of our great royal fathers, HRM Eze Sir I.O. Kanu, the Egwu Ukwu II of Afaraukwu Ibeku at the age of 86 years. “His unwavering love and sterling contributions to the development of his community in particular, and Abia State in general, are well documented. No doubt HRM left a lasting legacy and an indelible impression on the minds of Ndigbo everywhere in the world.” He assured the family of the late monarch of support in the period of mourning.
