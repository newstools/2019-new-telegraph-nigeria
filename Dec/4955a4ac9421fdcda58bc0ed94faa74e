The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) yesterday condemned the killings of aid workers by the Boko Haram and called on the Federal Government to immediately review its negotiation strategy with the Islamic sect to forestall future occurrence.  ACF, which described the killings as callous, barbaric and inhuman, also noted that it was a “clear desecration of Islam, which preaches sacred inviolability of the individual.”  A statement made available to newsmen in Kaduna titled; “ACF Condemned Killing of AID Workers,” also called on the Federal Government to intensify its rescue operations to give hope to the families of those still in captivity.  The statement signed by the National Publicity Secretary of ACF, Muhammad Ibrahim Biu, “urges the Federal Government to review its negotiation strategy with the terrorists and ensure that all kidnapped persons still in the captivity of the Boko Haram, including Leah Sharibu and the Chibok girls, are rescued and released to their families.   “ACF urges the Federal Government to intensify its rescue operations in order to assuage the fears of families of those kidnapped and Nigerians of what may happen to those still in captivity.”  Part of the statement also said: “Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) is shocked and saddened by the sad news of yet another killing of four aid workers, including a woman by the Boko Haram terrorists yesterday in Borno State.  “It will be recalled that sometimes last year; two female aid workers with International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were abducted by the terrorists during an attack on the military base in Rann, Borno State, and were subsequently executed by the terrorists on the grounds that the Federal Government (FG) failed to meet up some of their demands.”
