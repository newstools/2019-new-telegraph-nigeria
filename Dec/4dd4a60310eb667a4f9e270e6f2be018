The Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO) has come up with a policy to combat the incidents of sexual harassment on campus. This is also, as the university prepares to award first degrees and higher degrees to a total of 2848 graduates during its 32nd Convocation ceremony scheduled for Saturday. The Vice Chancellor, Professor Francis Eze disclosed these during the pre-convocation press briefing of University on Wednesday. According to the Vice Chancellor, the draft policy against sexual harassment on campus is presently being considered by the Governing Council of the university. Professor Eze said: “It is important that I inform you that the university has developed the Sexual Harassment Policy and is being considered by the Governing Council. This became necessary following the recent national outcry on cases of sexual harassments in our universities. “This document spells out what constitutes sexual harassment as well as appropriate sanctions for same.” The Vice Chancellor also noted that an Anti-Plagiarism Policy and University Research Policy have also been developed and are awaiting approvals of the university’s Senate and Council.
