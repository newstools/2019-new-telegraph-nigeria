 T he Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Adewale Akanbi, has divorced his Jamaican wife, Chanel Chin.   The monarch made this known in a statement made available to journalists yesterday in Osogbo by his Chief Press Secretary, Ali Ibrahim.   The statement reads: “This is to inform the general public, especially friends and associates of the Oluwo of Iwoland, His Imperial Majesty, Oba (Dr.) Abdulrosheed Adewale Akanbi, Telu I, that Ms Chanel Chin is an ex-queen of his majesty. This information is necessary for the attention of the general public to avoid representation on proxy or accordance of respect attached to the sacred stool of Oluwo to her. For personal irreconcilable differences, Chanel Chin ceased to be his Majesty’s queen.   We equally enjoin the public to disregard any business transaction or request with her using the office of his majesty. We wish her the best in her new journey.”
