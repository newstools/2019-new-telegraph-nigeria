Lagos State Government yesterday decried residents’ attitude towards safety, saying most of the deadly disasters recorded in the state are avoidable and caused by human error and carefree attitude towards safety.  The government, which also appealed to the residents to cooperate with the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), said that the response time to emergency can be improved upon, if the residents create a room for the enabling environment to get to the scene of the emergency and manage the situation effectively.  Speaking at the Year 2019 Staff Retreat, the Director- General, LASEMA Dr Femi Oke-Osanyintolu said that cohesion amongst staff is very key to achieving allround success by LASEMA with its staff strength of less than 150 personnel providing extremely sensitive and crucial, life-saving services to an estimated Lagos population of over 23.5 million people. He said that the agency’ staff must not only be well trained with skills horned to the nines for optimal performance.  “LASEMA staff must as a matter of survival, be well bonded to think and act as one especially during operations knowing that during emergencies, every second counts,” he said.  Lamenting that some residents’ lack proper orientation regarding the role of the agency and their expectations, Osanyintolu said that the agency would continue to do its best by managing any disasters in the state. On his part, a former Permanent Secretary in the state, Mr Bashiru Braimoh, who was also the Guest Speaker, said that the response time to emergency was improving due to the calibre of people appointed to manage the emergency agencies.  According to him, the state’s Commissioner for Special Duties had the prerequisite experience in the disaster management just as the Director-General of LASEMA, saying all these had contributed to the reduction of lives lost during disasters in the state. Buraimoh urged the emergency responders in the state to continue to workers harder to ensure safety of lives and property of the residents in the state
