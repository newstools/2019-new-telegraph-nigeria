No fewer than 11 persons have been killed following the invasion of armed bandits on Kukoki village in Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State on Tuesday night. Findings by the New Telegraph have it that the bandits held the people hostage for three hours during which they kidnapped the District head of Madaka Alhaji Zakari Yau, his wife as well as the village head of Kukoki. This is coming barely 48 hours after 11 people were killed in another community in Koki, Shiroro Local Government â€“ an attack which occurred on Sunday morning while the people were preparing to go to church. The Secretary of the District Council and a retired soldier were among the victims including six others. It was reliably learnt that the bandits, numbering over 20, stormed the district at about 10pm Tuesday and started shooting sporadically into the air before they burgled houses of the villagers. The bandits who came in with about 15 motorcycles were said to have ransacked houses and shops in the community and looted food and other valuables including cattle and sheep. A source close to Kukoki village told our correspondent that before the arrival of security operatives after several hours of distress calls, the bandits had disappeared into the bush.
