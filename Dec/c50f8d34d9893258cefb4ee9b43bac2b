* Ortom: Commissioning projects, a waste of time Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state Monday announced that he would lift the ban on employment into the state civil service by the first quarter of next year.
Besides, the governor silenced critics of his administration whom he said have resorted to challenging him on social media over his inability to commission any project since he became governor.
He pointedly told such critics that he does not believe in projects commissioning since “it is a waste of time and money”.
Governor Ortom announced the lift of embargo on employment while flagging off some refurbished vehicles of the State Environmental Sanitation Authority (BENSESA) for waste management to improve the sanitary condition of the state capital.
The governor, who directed immediate payment of the backlog of seven months stipend owed all casual staff of the agency which has accumulated to over N3.1 million, said already, he had put in place a committee to negotiate the minimum wage with labour unions to include them on the payroll of government.
“By the first quarter of 2020, we shall be lifting embargo on employment because I am aware that there are a little gaps in the civil service as a result of death and retirement of workers.
“So I have put in place a committee to negotiate the minimum wage with labour unions and by the time they end this and we know what is our actual wage bill and income of the state, then, we will be able to tally it with what we will do in terms of giving new employment to our people.”
