T he Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called on Bayelsa State governor, Seriake Dickson and his Rivers State counterpart, Nyesom Wike, to sheathe their swords in their altercations over disputed oil well.   Dickson and Wike had attacked each other since the court judgement that gave the disputed Soku oil well to Rivers State.  The two governors were elected on the PDP platform.   The party, in a statement yesterday by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said it has activated its internal reconciliation mechanism to settle the matter amicably.  “The PDP recognizes that the tone of disagreements between the two respected governors was skin-deep and only borne out of their love and zeal for their respective states.  “The PDP leadership hereby urges both Governors Wike and Dickson, as eminent leaders and frontline stakeholders in our party, to sheathe their swords while the leadership harmoniously resolves the issue,” the party said in the statement.   It assured party leaders, stakeholders, members and supporters, particularly in the two states, to remain calm and united, as the issue was already being resolved. PDP said it remains one big indivisible family and would not allow anything to undermine its unity and focus especially at this trying time in the history of the nation.
