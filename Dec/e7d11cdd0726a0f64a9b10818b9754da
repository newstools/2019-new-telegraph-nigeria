No fewer than five people died in an auto-crash which occurred along Ogbomoso-Ilorin Road on Thursday, while several were injured.
According eye witnesses, the accident, which occurred at about 3.47 p.m at Ladokun area in the Surulere North Local Council Development Area (LCDA), involved an Ilorin- bound commercial car and another one coming from Ilorin to Ogbomoso. The vehicles bore number plates RUW 135 XA and GBY 322 AA.
An eyewitness, Mr Ade Akanmu, said four people died on the spot while the last person died before getting to the hospital, adding that the accident  occurred as a result of wrong overtaking.
“In all, five people – three men and two women – died on the spot. Several others suffered varying degrees of injuries. We rescued the victims by cutting parts of the vehicles with an axe,” Akanmu said.
One of the passengers who lost his life in the accident was identified as Chief Alaaga by some sympathisers at the scene. It was gathered that the late Alaaga was coming from a meeting when he met his untimely death.
When contacted on the telephone, the state Commander, Federal Road Safety Corp, Mrs Uche Chukura, said she was yet to receive any signal on the accident.
