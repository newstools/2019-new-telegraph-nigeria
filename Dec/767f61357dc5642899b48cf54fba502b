The Minister of Power, Mr Sale Mamman, has suspended the Managing Director of Rural Electrification Agency, Ms Damilola Ogunbiyi. The Special Adviser to Mamman on Media and Communication, Mr Aaron Artimas, made this known in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja. Artimas said following some apparent infractions in the agency, the minister directed the managing director to proceed on indefinite suspension with immediate effect. He said Ogunbiyi had been directed to hand over to the next most senior officer in the agency, reports the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). “Consequently, the minister has directed an immediate investigation into the activities of the agency towards re-positioning it for better service delivery,’’ Artimas said.
