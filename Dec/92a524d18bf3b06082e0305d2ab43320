Stakeholders in the private sector have called on the Federal Government to encourage private sector investments in the cotton, textile and garment industry, with long term economic policies that will galvanise the sectors as employment hub for Nigerian youths. This was made known in a communiqué issued by the Editorial Board of Penpushing Media, following discussion on its platform comprising key political actors, professionals in diverse fields, traditional rulers among others after a thorough debate on the increasing takeover of foreign markets of local products. The debate also touched other related issues that seem to be eroding the nation cultural values, compounding the unemployment situation of Nigeria’s growing population and deepening the penchant of Nigerians for foreign items in place of local alternatives. The communiqué also took a critical look at the recent call by the wife of Ekiti State Governor, Erelu Bisi Fayemi for a ban on the importation of ‘Asooke’ from Asian countries, while applauding the call, the stakeholders submitted that Government should apply high tariff on the importation of finished textile products while giving waivers on importation of raw materials to local textile industries to make them more competitive and a contributor to the country’s GDP. Other resolutions stated: that the Central Bank of Nigeria should pursue it’s policy directive as enunciated by the Governor, Godwin Emefiele in April this year that ‘importers must source all cotton needs locally from 2020’ to bring about job opportunities in the textile and garment industry.
