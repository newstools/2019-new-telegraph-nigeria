Many major parts of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, on Monday witnessed heavy traffic gridlock when the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, visited the city and prayed for the residents at the December ‘Let’s Go A-fishing’ programme organised by the Region 21 of the church.  Mostly affected for about five hours when the man of God visited the Obafemi Awolowo Way Stadium (formerly Liberty Stadium) were the following areas: Ring Road, Liberty Road, Challenge -Molete Road, NTC Road, as well as, Oke Bola Road.  Following the gridlock, many of the worshippers, who came from different parts of the city and adjoining communities, trekked to the venue, as security men had a hectic time controlling both the human and vehicular traffic in order to maintain peace and orderliness.  Immediately he arrived, Pastor Adeboye prayed for the sick before mounting the podium where he also prayed for Governor Seyi Makinde, Oyo State in general and the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji, who was represented by his Princess Alhaja Rasidat.  Describing Ibadan as a special province that is very strategic to RCCG,  Adeboye said, “Ibadan is always the first to be in touch after the Holy Ghost Congress when the anointing is still fresh. Ibadan always comes first with a programme”, disclosing further that he would visit no fewer than 20 places during the December ‘Go A-fishing,’ programme.
