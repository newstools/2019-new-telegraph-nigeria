One of the country’s prospects for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, Odunayo Adekuoroye, has said she will try her best not to repeat the same mistakes she made at the last Olympics in Rio, Brazil, which was her first outing at the games. The 53k weight wrestler was defeated by Sweden’s Sofia Mattsson in the quarter final of the 2016 Games and she has set her sights on going for the gold medal in Tokyo. Speaking with our correspondent, the athlete who applauded the minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, on the recent Adopt-an-Athlete Initiative, said such opportunity would help to drive the athletes to success in Tokyo. “I am grateful and happy to hear about it (the Adopt-an-Athlete Initiative), it is good news to all athletes and I know it will translate to good outing at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games for all the athletes and the country will be better for it,” she said. “I am going for gold in Tokyo, made mistakes at the world Level this year, and still went ahead to get the bronze, so if I correct my mistakes as I prepare for competitions in the New Year, I am not match rusty, and with the help of God, all things are possible. “2019 was a good year for me. I won a gold medal at the German Grand Prix, was at the World Ranking series in Istanbul where I also won a gold, also at the World Championship and I won a bronze, I will say it was a very good year for me.” She applauded all the athletes that represented the country in different competitions in the year as she said 2019 was good for Nigeria as a country. According to her, two different athletes won medal at the world stage which was an improvement to the previous years. Adekuoroye added: “The athletes tried their best especially at the world level. We had two bronze medals this year which is okay compared to the previous years that I was the only one that won at the world level. “Seeing Ese Brume also winning a medal at the Athletics World Championships, shows that Nigerian athletes are going up.”
