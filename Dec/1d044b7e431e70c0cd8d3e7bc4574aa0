The Department of State Services (DSS), has released the convener of #Revolution Now Movement, Mr. Omoyele Sowore.
Sowore, the publisher of Sahara Reporters, was arrested alongside an activist, Mr. Olawale Bakare on August 3, for alleged treasonable felony, among other related charges.
However, an Abuja High Court had granted him bail weeks ago without the Service complying with the ruling, prompting the judge to threaten to charge the DSS with contempt.
But confirming Sowore’s release last night, spokesperson for the DSS, Dr. Peter Afunanya, said: “Yes, Sowore was (has been) released”.
Asked if the sum of N100, 000 was paid as fine, he said: “Yes, we paid the N100, 000.”
