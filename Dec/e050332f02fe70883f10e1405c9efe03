Serie A leaders Inter Milan missed the chance to move four points clear at the summit after being held to a goalless draw by Roma at the San Siro. The build-up to the fixture had been overshadowed by Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport’s ‘Black Friday’ headline, which was accompanied by images of Roma defender Chris Smalling and Inter striker Romelu Lukaku. Lukaku condemned the headline as “one of the dumbest” he has ever seen while Smalling said it was “wrong and insensitive”. Antonio Conte’s Inter were denied a seventh-minute opener after Lukaku drew a good save from Antonio Mirante, reports the BBC. Inter’s Marcelo Brozovic then blazed an attempt over following Mirante’s scuffed clearance shortly before half-time, while Mirante – in for Roma’s injured Pau Lopez – frustrated Inter further after the interval. England manager Gareth Southgate was in attendance, alongside assistant Steve Holland, as Roma’s Manchester United loanee Smalling stuck tight to former Old Trafford team-mate Lukaku throughout in what was an assured display. The result, which ends Inter’s five-match winning run, means reigning champions Juventus can move top with victory over third-placed Lazio on Saturday (19:45 GMT).
