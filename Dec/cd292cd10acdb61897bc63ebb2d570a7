Police in Ondo State said they had arrested 10 people in connection with the burning of a church in Akure, Sotitobire Miracle Centre. On Wednesday, some youths set fire to the church over a one-year-old boy, Gold Kolawole, who allegedly went missing during a Sunday service in the church in November. Youths mobilised to the church over the rumour that the body of the missing child was exhumed from the church’s altar. The rumour became rife following allegations that Gold had been used for rituals by the founder of the church, Prophet Babatunde Alfa. Yesterday, the state Commissioner of Police, Undie Adie, said more arrest would still be made concerning the attack on Sotitobire Miracle Centre. Adie said his men had swung into action to avoid the breakdown of law and order. He said: “Investigation is ongoing and I can assure you that any person linked with the incident won’t be spared. “Yesterday (Wednesday), we were able to arrest 10 persons and they are in our custody. “We also intercepted a vehicle carrying some of the properties looted from the pastor’s house. “The police were able to protect the pastor’s house from being set ablaze but some of his properties were looted and some of his cars were damaged but the cars have been moved to State Criminal Investigations and Intelligence Department (SCIID).” The commissioner also confirmed the death of a police sergeant and two civilians in the Wednesday attack. He also disclosed that another policeman was critically injured. Adie appealed to residents of Akure to be law-abiding and detach themselves from any unlawful act capable of putting them in trouble. Angry youths in the early hours of Wednesday burnt down Sotitobire Miracle Church in Akure and looted Alfa’s house on Oda Road.
