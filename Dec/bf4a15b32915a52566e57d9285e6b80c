Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami has told human rights lawyer, Femi Falana, that decision to release convener of the #RevolutionNow protests, Omoyele Sowore, will not be taken by his office alone.
Following a decision by Malami to withdraw Sowore’s case from State Security Services (SSS), Falana wrote the AGF asking for the release of his client.
Falana who is the lead defence counsel to Sowore who is currently being detained by the DSS.
But Malami declared that the “Federal Government is guided by extant laws and tradition of the law in handling legal matters and related ligitations.”
The AGF stated this in a statement released on Monday titled “FG guided by extant laws, court tradition.”
“When parties submit their issues for determination to a court of law, they lack exclusivity of decision over such issues without recourse to the court.
“We remain guided by the established tradition and will not take a unilateral decision without recourse to the rule of law,” he reaffirmed.
