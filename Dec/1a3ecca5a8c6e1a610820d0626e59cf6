The Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) yesterday said that the Federal Government has ordered an investigation into the invasion of the Federal High Court, Abuja, by the operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) last Friday. Malami stated this at the headquarters of the Federal High Court in Abuja while answering questions from journalists after paying a courtesy visit to the newly confirmed Chief Judge of the court, Justice John Tsoho. New Telegraph recalls that the DSS, in its bid to re-arrest the Convener of #RevolutionNow protest, Omoyele Sowore, had invaded the court, during which the judge – Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu – fled the scene. Answering questions from reporters, Malami said he did not visit the Chief Judge over Sowore’s case, but to congratulate him on his confirmation by the Senate as the substantive Chief Judge of the Federal High Court. Asked if he was not appalled by the DSS’ conduct, Malami said: “Whatever affects the integrity of the court is a worrisome issue for us. “I can never be pre-emptive of an incident over which I was not a live witness to. “But one thing I am certain of is that the government has put in place mechanism for investigation of the reported incident. “So, I would not like to be pre-emptive in terms of a conclusion, one way or the other, without allowing the consummation and conclusion of the investigation process.” The AGF also paid a similar visit to the newly confirmed President of the National Industrial Court, Justice B. B Kanyip.
