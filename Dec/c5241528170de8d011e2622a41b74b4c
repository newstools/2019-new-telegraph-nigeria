Daniel Atori, Minna As part of efforts to bring succor to the less privileged in Niger State, a non-governmental organisation, Ayewosai Foundation has distributed food items and clothing to over 100 persons in Minna, the state capital. Founder of the Foundation, who is also the Chief Press Secretary to the Niger Governor, Mrs Mary Noel Berje, said during the unveiling of the foundation in Minna that the gesture was to extend hand of fellowship to the less privileged especially widows and orphans in the society. In her message, she said: “I am passionate about helping humanity and ensuring the well-being of people especially women and children. “It is a dream I have had for the past seven years. I grew up seeing my father helping and fighting for the well-being of his people which are the Gbagyis, so it is a cause I inherited from him. “At first, I started this initiative with my Gbagyi people, I used to go to communities to give to the less privileged and encourage parents to send their children to school especially the girl-child because I know the importance of education. “I have this passion of always wanting to share whatever I have with people around me because I feel it doesn’t take anything to share with the neighbor next door.” Berje the added that the foundation was a non-political, non-tribal and non-religious organisation aimed at bring succour to the less privilege. One of the beneficiaries, Mrs Mercy Francis, while speaking on behalf of others, expressed appreciation to the founder and prayed God to uplift the foundation to greater heights.
