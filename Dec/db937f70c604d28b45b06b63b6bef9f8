 O peratives of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Person (NAPTIP), have arrested a travel agent for exploitative labour in Oman.   The suspect was alleged to have recruited and facilitated the trafficking of a 27-year-old lady to Oman in February 2019.   NAPTIP operatives have been on the trail of the suspect since the matter was reported sometimes in October 2019.   One of the suspects, Adeyemi Adeleke Jamiu, who is a travel agent, promised to procure Canadian visa for the victim after collecting N300,000, but later offered her nursing job in Oman after the Canada visa was denied.   Jamiu and his partner,  Oluwatosin Mariam Balogun, still at large, succeeded in trafficking the victim to Oman for housemaid job. She worked in a slavery like condition, serving 13 adults and seven children in five different bungalows, without rest for almost 24 hours every day.   After working for two months and paid N60,000 salary, the suspects started demanding for three months salaries as their commission.   When the victim fell sick due to the volume of work, and asked to be returned to Nigeria, the suspects demanded that she should pay the sum of N800, 000, including her return ticket.  The victim’s return has since been facilitated and the suspect is currently in custody while investigation continues.   According to NAPTIP, the case file will be forwarded to the legal and prosecution unit for further necessary action.  The Commander of NAPTIP, Lagos Command – Daniel Atokolo said that the Director General of NAPTIP – Dame Julie Okah Donli, has zero tolerance for offenders of human trafficking.
