  *Govt orders closure of schools, cites disturbing security report   Thousands of Youths loyal to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State Thursday protested against Friday’s planned mega rally to receive former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu and other defectors into the ruling party. This is as the state government also Thursday ordered the closure of all schools over what it described as “disturbing security report concerning the use of school premises for a political rally.” The protesting APC youths, who said they were drawn from 192 wards in the state, insisted they do not want any violence in the state. They marched from Ring road to the Benin Airport. The youths had set bonfires on different parts of the dual carriage Airport Road thereby causing hours of traffic gridlock, even as motorists made detours through other routes to the city centre. Spokesman for the protesters, Mr. Imafidon Utete, said they were on the streets to protest against plans to disrupt public peace under the guise of receiving PDP members.
