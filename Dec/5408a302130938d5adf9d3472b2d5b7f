The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Bayelsa State, Senator Douye Diri, has accused the State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Mr. Monday Udoh, of violating the Governorship Election Petition Tribunal order on the inspection of election materials.  Senator Diri said in defiance of the tribunal’s order, the REC allowed the All Progressives Congress (APC) to inspect sensitive and non-sensitive voting materials used during the November 16 governorship election.   Senator Douye Diri, in a statement made available to newsmen on Tuesday in Yenagoa, described the involvement of APC in the exercise as a flagrant abuse of the tribunal’s order.   “The tribunal had granted the prayer of the PDP counsel to inspect the materials. However, instead of complying with the order of the tribunal, the REC allowed APC, which is not a party to the prayer, to be part of the exercise,” he said.
He accused the REC of partisanship, saying his role in recent times​ justified the position of the PDP that he was working for the APC.   Diri called on the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmoud Yakubu, to beam his searchlight on the activities of the Bayelsa REC.
