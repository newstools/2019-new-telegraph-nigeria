Last year’s runner-up, Joseph Imeh comfortably took out Gabriel Friday in straight sets to reach the semifinals of the Vemp Open in Abuja yesterday. The 22-year-old No. 2 wrapped up a fine 6-3, 6-0 victory for a spot in the last four, where he will take on Emmanuel Idoko, who proved decisive in a second set tiebreaker to claim a 6-2, 7-6(4) victory over Uche Oparaoji. Imeh and Idoko’s semifinal meeting will be a repeat of the pair’s semifinal encounter at the Rainoil Open in Lagos last week, which Imeh won. Elsewhere, Defending champion, Sylvester Emmanuel advanced to the semifinals after Lawal Shehu retired due to injury midway through the first set. Shehu, 34, had led 3-1 before calling it quits. Emmanuel, who won the Rainoil Open title a week ago and will be looking to secure a second straight national title this week, will next face Nonso Madueke, who produced a strong performance to beat 17-year-old Musa Mohammed 6-2, 6-3. Meanwhile Nigeria’s current number one female player, Oyinlomo Quadre didn’t break a sweat in a 6-0, 6-1 victory over Toyin Asogba to qualify for the semifinal. Oyinlomo who is playing in the tournament for the first time is top favourite for the female title going by her recent performance. Defending champion, Blessing Samuel who claimed her second win in as many weeks over Osariemen Airhunwhunde may find Oyinlomo a hard nut to crack in the bid to retain her title. The championship is staged by the Nigeria Tennis Federation NTF.
