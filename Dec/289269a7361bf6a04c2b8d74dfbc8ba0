The students confirmed the incident, adding that Chibuike was playing with the device when it exploded. One of them said: “I was in the school when the explosion occurred. I can’t tell what it was. “But I saw Chibuike playing with the thing before it exploded. It’s like he came to school with it. “The thing chopped off his left hand. He has been taken to the Hospital.” The Ebonyi State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Loveth Odah, confirmed the incident.
