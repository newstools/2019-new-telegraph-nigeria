 Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the last presidential election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar has described the invasion of the Federal High Court, Abuja, presided over by Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu by officials of the Department of State Services (DSS) as a rape on the judiciary.   Atiku, in a statement he personally signed Friday, said the attack was not just on the judge but on the entire judiciary.   “This is unacceptable. It is a rape on the sanctity of the court. Nigeria is not a dictatorship. We are a democracy, no matter how inconvenient this fact is to the powers that have forced themselves on us,” Atiku said.   The former Vice President said he was in “extreme anguish” when he watched the drama at the court, and called on the authorities to set up an inquiry to identify those responsible for Justice Ojukwu’s maltreatment and desecration of the court.   “Never in the history of Nigerian democracy has a judge been treated in such a disdainful and brazen attack on not just her person and office, but on the entire judiciary.     “They must be sanctioned to the highest extent permissible by our laws,” he added.   Atiku further called on law enforcement agencies in the country to respect not just the court order made by Justice Ojukwu, but the order of any court on any detainee.
