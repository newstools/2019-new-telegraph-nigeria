M ohamed Salah scored twice as English Premier League leaders Liverpool battled to victory over strugglers Watford in Nigel Pearson’s first game in charge.  Salah curled the ball into the far corner for the opener before flicking in a late second in the final minute of normal time at Anfield.  Watford missed chances in both halves, while Liverpool’s Sadio Mane had a header ruled out for offside following a review by the video assistant referee (VAR).  Liverpool remain unbeaten in the league this season while Watford are six points – and with a substantial goal difference to overturn – adrift of safety.  The Reds were made to work for their victory though – goalkeeper Alisson making smart saves after the break, while Watford’s Ismaila Sarr also wasted a huge chance.  And Leicester were dealt a huge blow in the Premier League title race as they were held to a draw by a battling Norwich at King Power Stadium to leave them second on the table.  At Stamford Bridge, Dan Gosling’s late goal gave Bournemouth their first win since early November in a scrappy encounter with Chelsea.   The match looked to be heading for a goalless draw when Gosling flicked the ball over his and Kepa Arrizabalaga’s head, the goal originally ruled out for offside.  But the video assistant referee (VAR) awarded the goal, ending Bournemouth’s five-match losing streak and earning them their third away win of the season.
