Watford have confirmed that Quique Sanchez Flores has been sacked from his post as head coach. The Spaniard returned at the club in September but has won only two of his 12 games in charge and his second spell has ended after just 85 days. The 54-year-old was sacked a day after his side’s 2-1 loss to Southampton, which leaves them stuck at the bottom of the table. Watford chairman Scott Duxbury said: “Quique is a man of great integrity and it was clear how much he wanted to have a positive impact, but ultimately results have dictated our decision. “The appointment of a new Head Coach is imminent, and with nearly two-thirds of the season remaining, we will provide all the support necessary to make the coming months successful.”
