The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), has taken a former Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr. Mohammed Adoke (SAN), into custody.
The embattled former chief law officer was said to have been led away by operatives of the EFCC, shortly after arriving the airport at about 3:46pm, aboard Emirates airline.
Adoke was taken in shortly after arriving the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport from Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where he had been held by the International Police Organisation (INTERPOL), since last month.
Prior to the said arrest in Dubai, the EFCC had obtained an order of court for Adoke’s arrest, even as another court was said to have made a counter order restraining the commission from taking him in.
The anti-graft agency had, sometime in 2016, filed a criminal charge against Adoke before the federal high court in Abuja, over the Oil Prospective Licence (OPL) 245 settlement deal, otherwise known as ‘Malabu scandal’.
He has, however, denied the fraud allegations levelled against him.
There were, however, conflicting reports that the INTERPOL and not the EFCC, may have arrested Adoke, upon arrival in the country.
