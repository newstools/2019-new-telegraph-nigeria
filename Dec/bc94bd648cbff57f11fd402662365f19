•Commissioners, SAs get portfolios Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq on Friday inaugurated and called on his cabinet members to consider what legacies they would like to be remembered for in the discharge of their duties, saying the administration has a historical duty to change the narrative about the state. He also swore in members of the Civil Service Commission and the Deputy Chief of Staff Adebukola Risikat Babalola whose appointment was announced earlier Friday. He had earlier also named Architect Kale Belgore as Senior Adviser and Counsellor. He said: “Let me remind all of you that we are not the best out of the 3.5 million people in this state. However, providence has placed on our shoulders the historic responsibility to take our people out of Egypt and safely into the Canaan land. “This task requires focus, patience, sacrifice, tact, speed, and constant supplication to God Almighty to guide us on every step of the way. We must engage, listen, and relate well with our people whose mandate has brought us here. In doing so, we must see the whole of Kwara as our constituency.” The event was attended by hundreds of Kwarans and top government functionaries, including the Deputy Governor Kayode Alabi; Speaker of the House of Assembly Salihu Danladi Yakubu; Representative of the Chief Judge Justice Bayo Yusuf; Grand Kadi of Kwara State Ola Abdulkadir; principal officers and members of the House of Assembly; Secretary to the State Government Prof Mamman Jibril; Head of Service Modupe Oluwole; and Chief of Staff to the Governor Aminu Adisa Logun. The governor reminded the cabinet members of the need to always relate well with the public and to work together as a team, “stronger together, each watching the back of the other.”
