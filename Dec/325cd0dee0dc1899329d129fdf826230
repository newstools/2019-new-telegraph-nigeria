Professional British-Nigerian boxer, Anthony Joshua, is the man of the moment. Every lady is gushing over him and they all want him to be their dream man. Joshua has everything a lady is looking for, a good career, he is good looking and he is financially stable. The 30-year-old two-time unified heavyweight champion seems to be started a beef between actress, Daniella Okeke, and media personality, Toke Makinwa. It all began after Okeke shared a photo of the boxer on her Instagram page. She described him as her spiritual husband. Okeke noted that she would not mind preparing soup for him. Makinwa immediately replied to the post. In what was obviously a joke, the media personality commented and asked her to stay away from Joshua. She asked her to leave her husband alone. Meanwhile, Rapper Zlatan Ibile had earlier called on the professional boxer to leave DJ Cuppy alone for him. The rapper made the statement after he won N10k from Joshuaâ€™s rematch with Andy Ruiz. In his tweet, he also thanked Joshua for his N10k win. We also learnt that Cuppy had received a beautiful necklace gift from the boxer. The DJ took to social media to show off the beautiful necklace she received from Joshua and noted that she is grateful for the gift because she is always the one giving.
