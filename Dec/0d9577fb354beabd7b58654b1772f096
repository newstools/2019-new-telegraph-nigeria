A number of Arsenal players have approached the club’s board to voice concerns about the Gunners’ proposed appointment of Mikel Arteta. The Spaniard held talks with club officials in Manchester late on Sunday night to discuss a move to the Emirates and Metro.co.uk understands a deal is close to being completed. Arteta was a candidate to replace Arsene Wenger in 2018 but was ‘heartbroken’ when the Gunners decided to appoint Unai Emery instead. The 37-year-old spent five years in north London and managing the club is believed to be his ‘dream job’. However, a deal could be scuppered after several senior players raised concerns about the Spaniard’s lack of experience and whether he has the credentials to manage such a big club in his first steps into management. While there is a great level of respect for Arteta, the Mirror claims the squad are in agreement that they need an experienced manager and Carlo Ancelotti is said to be their favoured choice. The Italian has won three Champions League titles during his trophy-laden career and his wealth of experience is said to appeal to senior members of the squad. However, Ancelotti is believed to be in talks with Everton and Arsenal would have to move quickly to avoid the former Chelsea boss moving to Goodison Park. Regardless, Arteta remains the club’s first choice and the Spaniard was expected to hold a second round of talks with club officials on Monday night after impressing in their previous meeting.
