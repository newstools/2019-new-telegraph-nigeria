Super Eagles Manager, Gernot Rohr, has declared that he has not mandated any  member of the Nigeria Football Federation to invite players on his behalf. A top chieftain of the NFF reportedly  met with Queens Park Rangers of England midfielder, Eberechi Eze, with a view to convincing him  to pledge his future to Nigeria but Rohr insisted  he did not sanction anyone to approach any player. Rohr has said would not bow to any pressure from his employers to force Eze or any other player on him. Rohr stressed: “I will never ask the NFF publicly to approach any player for our team. We have our processes and it certainly doesn’t include sharing such information publicly.” A cross section of Nigerian fans and soccer pundits reacting to the issue had said the task of inviting players should be left with the team’s gaffer. The current situation might further severe the situation between both parties as Rohr has publicly asked for some of his unpaid allowances and salaries, the comment which later earned him a query from the soccer authority. Rohr’s contract ends June 2020 and there strong indications that the 66 year old may walk away if there is no increment in his salary and allowances. DR Congo has quietly been making enquiries about the Franco-German coach but his employers said he was still in contract with them.
