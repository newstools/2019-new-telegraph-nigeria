Two persons were reportedly killed yesterday in Lagos during a free-for-all between members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) and Road Transport Employer Association of Nigeria (RTEAN). The incident occurred at Aguda, Surulere area of the metropolis. The clash, it was learnt, started on Sunday night and continued till yesterday were the two persons identified as Sodeeq Kowasise and Qoyum were killed. It was also learnt that 75 people have been arrested by the police in connection with the violent clash. There were sporadic shootings around Aguda, Cassete bus stops and Pako area as colleagues of the deceased union members went on the rampage to revenge the death of their members. The arrival of men of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) and other policemen from the area was said to have doused the tension as the warring hoodlums scampered in different directions. A resident of the area, who gave her name as Bose, said there was tension in the community. She said before the arrival of policemen the hoodlums were pelting one another with bottles, as they also used dangerous weapons freely for hours. “What I gathered that caused the clash was that some members of  NURTW were having fun around the Canal area  of Pako when some people, suspected to be their rivals in RTEAN, invaded the area and opened fire on them,” Bose said. Three people were hit by bullets from the rampaging hoodlums while two of them died in the process. The victims, Kowasise  and Qoyum, were identified as members of the NURTW. The news of the death of the union members sparked instant violence from some of their mates, who went on the rampage around Pako, Aguda and other parts of Surulere yesterday afternoon. Residents and workers in the area had to run in different directions for the fear of being hit by stray bullets. Another resident of the area, Hakeem, said that this was the second time in less than a year that such attack had taken place in the community.
