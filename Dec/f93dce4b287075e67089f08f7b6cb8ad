Access Bank Plc has donated an interrogation room to the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) at Alagbon, Lagos. In addition to the fully equipped facility, the bank also donated a 250 KVA generator to the force to help improve their working conditions and that of neighbouring communities. The Group Managing Director, Access Bank Plc., Herbert Wigwe, who was represented at the commissioning by the Group Head, Enterprise Business Resources, Mac Atom, spoke on the bank’s motive and commitment to corporate social responsibility. “Partnerships and social investment remains a critical part of Access Bank’s sustainability drive. In our bid to offer more than banking and create value for various government agencies, we have donated state of the art interrogation and observation rooms to select divisions of the Nigerian Police Force across the country, starting with Lagos. “We thank the NPF for all they do, especially for seeing to it that all our customers remain protected and secure,” he said. Speaking on behalf of the NPF, the Assistant Inspector General of Police in charge of Force Criminal Investigation Department (FCID) Annex, Alagbon, Ikoyi, Murtala Mani, expressed gratitude for the donation and urged other private organisations to follow Access Bank’s blueprint in offering support to the Force. Over the years, the bank’s sustainability focus areas and community investment include education, health, gender equality, arts, and sports – demonstrating its commitment to channeling noteworthy resources and funds into impacting citizens positively and responsibly.
