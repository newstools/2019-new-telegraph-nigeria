A retired naval officer, Captain Dada Labinjo and his wife, Mrs Bola Labinjo, were yesterday arraigned by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) at a Federal High Court in Lagos over alleged bunkering. The Labinjos were docked alongside a Vessel, M. T. Adeline Jumbo and 14 others before Justice Muslim Hassan on a 2-count charge of dealing in petroleum products without license. Captain Labinjo who was said to have been in the custody of the Navy since September last year, was brought to court on Monday by the EFCC on the order of court. Prior to Labinjo’s appearance in court yesterday, his wife and others, have been arraigned by the EFCC. Addressing the court, EFCC’s lawyer, Oluwakemi Yemi -Makinde, said Labinjo was brought to EFCC’s office on Sunday by the Nigerian Navy. The charge was subsequently read to the defendants and they all pleaded not guilty. Defence lawyer, Gboyega Oyewole (SAN), then pleaded with the court to allow Labinjo’s wife and others to continue on the existing bail granted them earlier by the court. While urging the court to admit Labinjo to bail, Oyewole said his client has been in an underground cell for over 15 months. In a Bench ruling, Justice Hassan admitted Labinjo to bail in the sum of N10 million with one surety each in like sum. Other defendants were also admitted to bail on the same condition. Afterwards, Oyewole pleaded with the court to release Labinjo to one of the lawyers in his team, Jerry Omoregie, pending when he perfects his bail conditions. In granting the request, the judge ordered that Labinjo should be released to Omoregie pending the fulfilment of his bail conditions. He however directed the lawyer to submit his Called-to-Bar Certificate to the court’s registrar. Justice Hassan ordered that the bail conditions must be perfected within 15 days, failure which Labinjo should be taken to prison.
