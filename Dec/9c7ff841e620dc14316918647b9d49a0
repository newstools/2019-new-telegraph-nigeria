Thirteen people have been shot at a ‘memorial house party’ in honour of victim who was gunned down earlier this year. Police were called to a residence on the 5700 block of South May Street, Chicago, at 12.35am on Sunday morning, officers confirmed. Four of the victims, including a 16-year-old boy, are said to be critically injured. The party was being held to celebrate Lonell Irvin, 22, who was shot dead during an attempted carjacking in April, the ‘Chicago Tribune’ reports. A woman at the scene said: “They were just celebrating a memorial for somebody that passed away, and this is what they do.” She added: “It’s real f***ing sad. Your kids can’t grow up, you can’t do nothing. This is what our life is going to be about.” Terence Daniely, 57, who lives near the house, said he woke up to at least five gun shots, reports metro.co.uk. It is believed those responsible for the shooting were not guests of the party and had gate-crashed the event. All the victims have been taken to nearby hospitals. Chief of Patrol Fred Waller said the victims range in age between 16 and 48 and suffered “different and various gunshot wounds to their bodies”. He said two people are now being questioned, one of whom was arrested with a weapon. Waller said the shooting started inside and then more shots were fired as people began spilling out of the house. He also added that shots were also fired at a third place in the vicinity, but described the situation as an “isolated incident’’.
