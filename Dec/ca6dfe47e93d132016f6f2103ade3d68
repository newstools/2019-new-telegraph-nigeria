The Akwa Ibom State Ministry of Women Affairs and Agriculture, yesterday, said it has convicted 18 offenders for cases of gender-based violence and arrested over 180. The ministry listed such offenses to include rape, child abuse, molestation and wife battering. The ministry therefore called for the passage of the Violence Against Persons (Prohibited) Law in Akwa Ibom State. The state Commissioner for Agriculture and Women Affairs, Dr Gloria Edet, said that to commemorate this year’s 16 days of activism for the elimination of violence against women in Uyo, the government has taken over the care of some children whose parents had been convicted and those that didn’t anyone, who would take care of them. Edet, who is Dean of Commissioners and Special Advisers to the Governor, vowed that no circumstances would prevent the government from prosecuting sexual offenders, especially those that prey on children, and gender-based violence perpetrators. She said that the intent was to end violence against women by 2030.
