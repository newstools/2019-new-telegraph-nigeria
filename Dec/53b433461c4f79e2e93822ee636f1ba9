The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said the N40 billion fraud rocking the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has exposed the All Progressives Congress (APC) as a party of treasury looters
The party in a statement Monday by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, challenged the APC to come clean and explain to Nigerians how the money was allegedly used to finance its 2019 campaigns.
PDP said the revelation has reportedly unsettled certain persons in the presidency, adding that it has further exposed the APC as a decadent lot; “a gathering of treasury looters who thrive in cheating, deceit and pretences at very high levels.”
It added that the development has vindicated its stand that “the APC is an extremely callous and hypocritical party, which has no iota of conscience but takes delight in depriving our citizens and pillaging resources meant for the wellbeing of our people.
“It is shameful that instead of being remorseful, agents of the APC are reportedly engaging in dirty infighting over how the money was ‘shared’, with certain top leaders of the APC allegedly getting up to N3 billion each.”
PDP alleged that the Nigerian public has reports of how very top leaders of the APC, including those operating at the Presidency, were used to conduit the money from the FIRS, and warned that the matter should not be swept under the carpet.
