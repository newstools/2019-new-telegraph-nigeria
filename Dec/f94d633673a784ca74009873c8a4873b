Some Concerned Niger Delta youths on Sunday threw their weight behind the aspiration of Wanaemi John Daukoru towards his plans to succeed Degi Eremienyo, who  was elected the Deputy Governor of Bayesa State in the November governorship election.   Degi had been representing the Bayelsa East Senatorial District at the red chambers before he won the deputy governorship seat on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Rising from a meeting at the Ijaw House in Yenagoa, the concerned youths maintained that the decision was strictly based on the needs for security, peace and development in the region. According to a press statement signed by the Chairman, Nicholas Ebimobowei and secretary, Amos Ikiomoye and made available to New Telegraph, the group said that: “A careful perusal of the credentials of John Daukoru shows that he is a man of peace and will be a great unifying factor in the ancient Nembe  Kingdom.” The concerned youths, however, advised that  in the best interest of unity and peace, the leadership of the various political parties should look away from whatever preconceived imposition arrangements  they have  and seek to truly unify all interest group by not using the senatorial seat to compensate any group. “We are very much aware that John Daukoru has not been corrupted by  the regular political class as he has over the years built and made indelible mark in the private sector.  “Therefore, we the leadership of all concerned Ijaw youths have resolved to activate all  the organs  to drive home our position in this matter by not only throwing our weight behind him, but will go
further to organise rallies in support of John Daukoru. “We are therefore calling on all parties to adopt our position because at this point it is not about APC, PDP or any other party but about the peace, unity, and development of the Ijaw nation,” the statement said.
