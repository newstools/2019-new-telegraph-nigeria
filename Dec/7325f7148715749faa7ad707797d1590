The Olu of Warri, Ogiame Ikenwoli, has pleaded with President Muhammadu Buhari to focus on the actualisation of the multibillion dollars Ogidigben gas project in Warri South West Local Government Area of Delta State. Ogiame Ikenwoli, who made the appeal while addressing thousands of Itsekiris and visitors during his fourth coronation anniversary at Ode-Itsekiri, (Big Warri) yesterday, said the gigantic project would engage Nigeria’s full priority, given the economic importance, such as job creation, and enhance economic potential. “We believe that this should be one of President Buhari’s star projects and we will continue to plead with him for work to resume at the shortest possible time”, stressed the Warri monarch. He, however lauded Mr. President for giving approval and traction to the new Warri deep sea port, and the minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, for their joint action of making the project a reality. On the last general elections, the Olu lamented the losses by the Itsekiri nation, arising from mutual suspicion, greed, selfishness, narrow mindedness and unhealthy rivalry”, which he said left bitter experience within the Itsekiri nation. “Needless to say that I am aware of all the horse trading that took place across party divides, driven mostly by these personal and very parochial considerations, as it stands today”, stressed the monarch amid loud ovation. He regretted that Itsekiri has come down from the position of four members at the state House of Assembly to mere two seats and blamed the setback on the action of politicians. He reminded his people of Federal Government plans to have a national census and enjoined the people to make themselves available for the exercise, explaining that Warri South is the only few local government that the delineation is taking place.
