Barely four days to the celebration of Christmas on December 25, report across the country paint a gloomy picture of what is likely to befall Nigerians in the wake of the celebration regarded as one of the most festive Christian holidays across the world.  Though the period celebrates Jesus’ Christ birth, investigations across the country reveal that the current socio-economic and political state of the economy is likely to affect the razzmatazz associated with the period, report our correspondents IMO Not a few Nigerians have expressed concerns over the increasing prices of food items in the market as Christmas approaches. Saturday Telegraph market survey indicates that the prices of common food items in the market have all increased with as much as 80 per cent.  For instance, a dealer in food items, Mrs. Ngozi Okereke, told our correspondents that there was a sharp increase in the prices of food items in the market, wondering how holiday makers and residents in the state would be able to cope at Christmas.  According to her, a 50kg bag of local rice sold between N10,000 to N12,000 was presently selling between N24,000 and N25000. Also, a 50kg foreign rice which previously sold for between N17000 to N18,000, was now selling for between N26,000 to N27,000. She said: “Groundnut oil that sold for between N1800 to N2,000 now sells for N2,500 to N2,600. With tomato pack that hitherto sold for N1,120 now sells for N1,500. It has not been easy for Nigerians and it is showing in the level of patronage we get from our customers.”  Similarly, a housewife, Mrs. Jossy Patrick, lamented what she described as the staggering prices of chicken in the market. According to her, around November, one could buy a sizeable chicken that could serve the family for N2,000 or N2,500 is now selling between N3,500 and N4,000. “The implication is that some families that hitherto used only one chicken may have to buy two, to be able to get enough for the their family. Most families may have to adjust their budgets or seek alternative sources of animal protein,” she said. DELTA Ahead of the celebration, the unchangeable forces of demand and supply have greatly affected the market prices of goods and services in Delta State.  The back-slapping, hustling and bursting at marketplaces and shopping malls for last minute purchase have forced the prices of rice, chicken, vegetable oil, salt, pepper, tomatoes and others to skyrocket beyond the reach of consumers.  While a full size bag of foreign rice which was initially N28,000 rose to N34,000 this week, a bag of local rose from N18,000 last week to N26,000. Live chicken had become a ‘no-go’ area at the popular Ogbeogonogo Market in Asaba and Midwifery Market at Okpanam as the prices ranged from N4,000 to N8,000 depending on the size or weight. Vegetable oil, tagged, groundnut oil,   soya oil and others have all increased in prices by N100 and N200 respectively, compared to last week.
