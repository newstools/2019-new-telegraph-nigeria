Former President Olusegun Obasanjo, on Thursday, expressed shock over the death of his erstwhile Special Adviser on Women Affairs, Chief (Mrs) Titilayo Ajanaku.
Obasanjo noted that the loyalty and commitment to women development of the deceased was exemplary and worthy of emulation.
This was contained in a statement signed by Kehinde Akinyemi, Special Assistant (Media) to the former president.
Obasanjo, who wrote a personal condolence letter to the Head of the Ajanaku family, stated that his late aide played a prominent role in his decision to contest for the post of President in 1998.
He recalled how Ajanaku joined other Nigerians to visit in 1998 to persuade him in contesting for the Presidential election.
Obasanjo described the deceased as a woman who would do everything in her capacity to uplift, improve and advance the cause of women, saying this largely informed reasons for her being appointed as his special adviser.
