 One of the most brilliant and accomplished Professors of English and African Literature in America, Tejumola Olaniyan, is dead. He died on Saturday afternoon of heart failure in his home in Madison. Olaniyan, who turned 60 on April 3rd, this year, has concluded plans to travel to Europe for a conference before his death. He was the Louis Durham Mead Professor in English and the Wole Soyinka Humanities Professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.  Between 7 and 10 August this year, he was one of the arrowheads of the celebration of Wole Soyinka held in Akure by ‘The Fagunwa Study Group.’ He is survived by his wife, Mojisola Olaniyan, a Dean in the Faculty of Law, University of Wisconsin, Madison and two daughters, Bolajoko and Olabimpe.  Olaniyan has approximately 35 of his works in over 100 publications. They include: Scars of Conquest/Masks of Resistance, Arrest the Music: Fela and His Rebel Art and Politics (co-edited with Ato Quayson), African Literature: An Anthology of Criticism and Theory, (co-edited with John Conteh-Morgan), African Drama and Performance (co-edited with James H. Sweet), African Diaspora and the Discipline (co-edited with Peter Limb), Taking African Cartoons Seriously: Politics, Satire and Culture. He edited, ‘State and Culture in Post-colonial Africa.’ He was until his death editor of, ‘Journal of the African Literature Association.’ Olaniyan was putting finishing touches to his magisterial book on African cartoons before his death. He has produced many successful scholars. He was well-loved by many of his students for his rigour and his kindness. Indeed, Olaniyan hosted many of them at the last Thanksgiving holiday.  He earned his bachelor’s degree from the University of Ife in Nigeria in 1982. Three years later, he received his Master of Arts degree there. Olaniyan attended Cornell University where he earned his MA (1985) and PhD (1991).
