The Department of State Services (DSS), Tuesday, said it had uncovered plots by some unnamed groups to destabilise the country. It said part of the “syndicated” plots, was to instigate mass action and protests across the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), leading to breakdown of law and order. According to the secret service, the planned protests, expected to be executed in the coming weeks, will hold across the six geo-political zones of the country. In a statement by its spokesperson, Dr. Peter Afunanya, the DSS noted that the motive was to use the yuletide season, ostensibly to give it more potency. “These predetermined actions have been designed to take place simultaneously in the major cities across the geopolitical zones in the coming weeks. “This is more so that the plotters are also targeting the yuletide seasons to accomplish their sinister motives,” Afunanya said. Against the backdrop of the implications on national security, the Service has warned the sponsors of the planned action to have a rethink, or risk arrest and possible prosecution.
