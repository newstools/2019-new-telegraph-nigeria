A n Osun State High Court sitting in Osogbo yesterday sentenced a 33-year-old man, Mutiu Rasak, to death by hanging for killing a man, Kehinde Adesina.  The convict, who shot Adesina, also axed the finger of another man, Wale Makinde.  Rasak had earlier been arraigned in court on January 31, 2018 on an eight-count charge of murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, assault, engaging in secret cult and others, before he was convicted yesterday.  The prosecuting counsel from the Ministry of Justice, Wuraola Ogunfolabi (a barrister), told the court that the convict, who was a cult member, stormed the area of his victims with some of his gang members and attacked some people in the area.  Ogunfolabi also told the court that Rasak committed the crime on November 18, 2015 about 8p.m., at Abaku area of Osogbo but the convict testified in his defence without calling any witness.  After the closure of the prosecution case, however, Rasak’s counsel, W. O. Wemimo, prayed the court to temper justice with mercy.  Delivering her judgement, Justice Kudirat Akano, hereby discharged him from three of three of the eight-count charge preferred against him.  The judge convicted Rasak on the remaining five.  She said the prosecutor had proven his case beyond reasonable doubt.  Akano sentenced him – seven years imprisonment for conspiracy, 21 years for engaging in secret cult and death for murder.
