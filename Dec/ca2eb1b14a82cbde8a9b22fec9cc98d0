A Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Mr. Godwin Obla, currently standing trial with a dismissed judge of the Federal High Court, Justice Rita Ofili-Ajumogobia, for alleged graft, has petitioned the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Justice John Tsoho, seeking re-assignment of the case from Justice Mohammed Aikawa to another judge.
Indications to this effect emerged Monday at the resumed hearing of the matter.
Addressing the court on the issue, Obla’s lawyer, Chief Ferdinand Orbih (SAN), said the letter to the Chief Judge was written on November 14. The silk added that another letter was on November 26, written to notify the court.
He subsequently urged the court to stay further proceedings in the matter pending when the Chief Judge will act on his client’s petition.
Responding, prosecution’s lawyer, Yusuf Buhari, was opposed to Orbih’s request, saying the court’s business for the day is for trial.
“I am not aware of the letter and I don’t know whether we have been served. The business of the day is for trial and our witness is in court. Whatever may be the contents of the letter, we feel it should not stall today’s trial. There should be no stay in criminal proceedings,” Buhari said.
After listening to all parties, Justice Aikawa discountenanced Buhari’s objections and granted Orbih’s request.
“Because of the nature of the application, it might be better to wait for the CJ’s response. I am aware of the provisions of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA), but in the interest of justice, it will be better to wait for the CJ’s response. Transparency demands that we wait,” the judge held.
Further hearing in the matter has been adjourned to February 6, 2020.
