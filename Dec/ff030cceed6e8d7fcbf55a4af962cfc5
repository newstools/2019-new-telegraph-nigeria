However, after 3 kids, I thought I had retired from the baby-making business. So a while back, we found out we had a baby on the way. I can’t explain the joy and peace expecting our new baby has brought, or the cravings for food that have followed. I get so emotional easily, in fact right now I’ve started crying from joy again. “I’m sharing this with you my family for life, hanging on since day 1, growing with my family and I and always showing all the love. I love you all right back. Baby Okojie 2020 getting ready God bless you all!!” she wrote. Mercy Johnson and her husband recently celebrated their eighth wedding anniversary.
