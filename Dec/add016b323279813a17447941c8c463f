The Lagos State government Thursday said that it had rescued about 31 under-aged children across the state from street begging or roaming around. New Telegraph learnt they were rescued from Idi-Araba, Sabo, Eko Hotel, Adeola Odeku, 1004 and other areas within the metropolis. Meanwhile, as part of the intervention programme towards improving the wellbeing of people living with mental and physical deformity, the Lagos State government through the Ministry of Youth and Social Development has given financial assistance to service providers for disabled children in the state. Speaking at the presentation ceremony, which held at Correctional Centre for Junior Boys, Birrel Avenue, Sabo, Yaba, the Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Mr. Segun Dawodu described the financial intervention as a responsive approach towards building an inclusively progressive society as well as promoting the art of kindness. Dawodu stated that it has become a priority in the present administration to include the welfare of people living with disabilities in its policies and programmes. While presenting the cheque to Heads of homes and facilities for disabled children, the Commissioner stated that the aim of government is to create a level playing ground where children with disabilities can thrive, prosper, reach their developmental potential and contribute to the development of the society. “The potential of children living with disabilities is often overlooked. Due to lack of adequate policies and legislation, these children are effectively barred from realizing their rights to healthcare, education and even survival,” he revealed.
