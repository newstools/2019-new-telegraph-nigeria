Chairman South East Governors Forum and Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, yesterday said the pace of work has improved in the ongoing construction of the second Niger Bridge.  He said the issues between the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing and the host communities had been sorted out and commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the project. Umahi debunked a media report that South East leaders were sabotaging Buhari in regard to the work.  Umahi said all the leaders in South East zone were happy over the construction work and described the said media report, which quoted him as saying that South East leaders were sabotaging the construction work as misleading and untrue.  In a statement signed by his Commissioner for Information and State Orientation, Barrister Uchenna Orji, he said, “the governor did not at any time mention that leaders of the zone are sabotaging ongoing construction of the second Niger Bridge as reported. “The issues between the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing and the host communities, and the progress of work at the second Niger Bridge have been sorted out generously.  The pace of work has improved and for us it is a major achievement in the socio-economic profile of the South East, for which we shall continue to be grateful to the President and Commander in Chief of the Armed forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari.”
