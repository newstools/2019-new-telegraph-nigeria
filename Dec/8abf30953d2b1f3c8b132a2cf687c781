Former Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino says he is ready to return to management quickly, showing no interest in an extended break from the game.  The Argentine had led Spurs to the UEFA Champions League final last season and remains one of the most sought-after coaches in the game. But he was sacked by the north London club last month and replaced by Jose Mourinho. Yet, while talking in an interview of his “love” for Tottenham, he did not rule out a return to Spurs at some stage in his career.  The Argentine, in his first comments to journalists since his exit from Spurs, also said there was no club he would not talk to – even Arsenal. Pochettino said that after spending time with his parents and family in Argentina he is now getting prepared for whatever his next challenge will be, reports Reuters.  “After five and a half years in Tottenham it is a weird time for us. But at the same time very relaxed, very happy when you look backwards. And of course obviously in life you need to move on,” he said. Pochettino told a small group of reporters in Qatar ahead of the Club World Cup final between Liverpool and Flamengo that he was recharging his batteries.  He added that he was aiming to “be ready if something arrives and of course (I am) open to listen”.
