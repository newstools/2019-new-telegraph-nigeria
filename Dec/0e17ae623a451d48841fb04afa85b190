Police in Ogun State have arrested four suspected kidnappers for allegedly killing a seven-year-old boy, Abdulmalik Musa, after collecting a ransom of N300,000 from his parents.
Incidentally, one of the suspects, Farouq Seidu, is a younger brother of the victim’s father, Abdulhamid Musa Chindo.
The other kidnappers include Hassan Hussein, 30; Abeeb Nura, 24; and Mohammed Bello, 42.
The state Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, who confirmed the arrest of the suspects, disclosed that they murdered the victim and dumped his remains in the Ogun River.
The suspects were said to have initially demanded a ransom of N5million after which they agreed to collect N300,000 from parents of the deceased.
Hundreds of residents thronged the Enu-Gada area of Abeokuta to catch a glimpse of the corpse of the boy which was floating as at press time.
Briefing reporters, Oyeyemi said the mastermind of the kidnapping, Seidu, had claimed that he contracted others over the refusal of the boy’s father to give him money to marry a third wife.
The PPRO stated that the suspects murdered the victim after he recognised one of them as his uncle.
