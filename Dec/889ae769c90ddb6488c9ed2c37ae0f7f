N igeria Customs Service (NCS) has vowed to use everything within its power to fish out the bandits who killed its officers carrying out their lawful duties in Kogi State.  The Customs Area Controller, Kogi/Niger Command, Abba-Kassim Yusuf, made the promise in a statement issued yesterday by the Public Relations Officer (PRO), Lomba Benjamin.  Yusuf urged aggrieved Nigerians, whose goods were impounded, to seek redress in court rather than resort to violence.  The controller assured families of the officers killed that the management would deploy all necessary mechanisms to ensure the perpetrators of this evil act were brought to book.  He said: “This sad event will not distract us from vigorously discharging our statutory functions.”  Patrol officers were attacked by bandits on Lokoja-Okene Road on December 12.  The assailants shot dead two officers, ASC I, S. Ohiremen and ASC I, S. M. Omale, and injured another officer, DSC, H. I. Oladapo.  Yusuf said in the statement that the injured officer was quickly moved to the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Lokoja, for medical attention, discharged from the hospital and would be returning to work as soon as he was fit.  He said: “Officers of the Nigeria Customs Service are only implementers of Federal Government policies, hence we urge every Nigerian citizen aggrieved toward losing their goods to engage the services of the court rather than resort to violence and killing of family men whom are the bread winners of their families while serving their nation.”
