He was charged in the Philippines after admitting his crimes, report the Sun Star. The Filipino suspect – identified by police as Lloyd Bagtong – confessed to beheading the woman with a garden tool and eating the inside of her head. Bagtong said he was “drunk and hungry” when he committed the gruesome crime.
