 B andits on Saturday killed eight people in Senator David Umaru’s community, Kaure, Kwaki Ward in Shiroro Local Government of Niger State.  It was learnt that the attack on Umaru’s community occurred in the early hours of Saturday despite the presence of security personnel.  Similar attacks occurred three weeks ago, claiming 13 lives at Kukoki in Shiroro Local Government Area, while the District Head of Madaka, Alhaji Zakari Yau, his wife, the village head of Kukoki and four others, among them the Secretary of the district council and a retired soldier were kidnapped.   Speaking with our correspondent on the phone, the councillor representing the ward, Malam Jafaru Kwaki, said the bandits stormed the community on motorcycles with three persons on each about 7a.m., shooting sporadically into the air. He said: “I received again the sad development of the invasion of a community in my area by armed men dressed in black.  “They, as have been their characteristics, stormed the community on motorcycles, shooting. From the information at my disposal, eight people have lost their lives in an attack that lasted some hours.   “We cannot ascertain the number of people injured in the attack yet because many people escaped into the bushes with bullet wounds. But we were able to move 15 who sustained various degrees of injury to health centres. “The attackers rustled cows, dispossessed locals of cash and foodstuffs at gunpoint. “They burnt two vehicles, five machines and some houses.”
