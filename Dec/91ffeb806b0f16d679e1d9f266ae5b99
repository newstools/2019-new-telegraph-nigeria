President Muhammadu Buhari is saddened by the reported execution of four aid workers in the North-East by terrorists. The presidency, in a statement on Saturday, said Buhari condemned the killings. However, Buhari made reassurances of his regime defeating the terrorists. “The defeat of evil by good is inevitable, no matter the pyrrhic victory evildoers seem to win”, a part of the statement read. It added: “The President feels saddened by the claimed development, and commiserates with the family and loved ones of the aid workers, who had offered themselves to serve humanity at grave risks. “The aid workers had been abducted near Damasak, Borno State, in July, and had been held despite all efforts to secure their release, till their alleged execution.” It quoted the President in his own words, saying: “Evil will always be defeated by good at the end of the day. “Whatever seeming victory evil records, eventually rebounds on the evildoer. We are resolved to beat evil in this land, and we remain unrelenting till we achieve it.” Buhari called on all insurgents to quit terrorism. The statement was signed by his media aide, Mr Femi Adesina.
