  The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki on Thursday declared that there is no division in the Edo State Chapter of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), noting that all those working to destabilise the party would be shown the way out.
Obaseki stated this at a gathering of APC members drawn from Owan East and West local government areas, which held in Sabogida-Ora town, Owan West Council Area of the state.
He said the APC in the state is united, strong and formidable, stressing that members of the Edo Peoples Movement (EPM) are not members of the APC.
The governor said: “Members of the EPM are trying to frustrate the good plans we have for Edo people as their plan is to burn markets and government buildings. Their intention is to discredit our administration but the people of Edo know better.”
He pointed out that both the opposition group, under the umbrella of Edo Peoples Movement (EPM), and the National Chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole are no longer members of the party, the later having been suspended by members of the APC in the state.
