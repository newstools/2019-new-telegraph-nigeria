Officials of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) have arrested and impounded 25 vehicles used to convey 2,540 (50kg) bags of parboiled rice, 15 bags of sugar; 40 bales of second-hand clothes and shoes, as well as 500 pieces of tyres with the Duty Paid Value (DPV) of N142,896,113.00. The Controller, Osun/Oyo Area Command, Abdullahi Argungu, disclosed this while briefing journalists yesterday at the Ibadan Command Headquarters. Argungu said the border closure was making positive impacts in the area of security control, illegal immigration regulation, encouragement of local farmers, as well as, encouragement of patronage of made in Nigeria goods and agricultural products. He disclosed that the command projected annual revenue target was N30 billion which it exceeded by 59 per cent, ploughing in N34,686,875,967.80 as against the N21,954,286,381.10 recorded in 2018. Argungu said that the recalcitrant smugglers were employing a series of hazardous tactics in moving through bushes where seven vehicles were seized. He said: “They are deadly because they create roads by themselves in the bushes and they usually move in the night. We get them tracked through intelligence report.” Argungu, however, bemoaned the activities of some unscrupulous drivers of trucks who were collecting money from the smugglers to convey their illicit goods. The controller used the occasion to present awards to three of personnel who outstandingly distinguished themselves in the year. They are AC Amusan John, CSC Adewole Moses and ASC Idowu Gafar. Argungu urged Nigerians to take advantage of Federal Government’s programmes on agriculture and other empowerment programmes to key into legitimate means of livelihood. He said: “The border drill is still in force, and the command will not relent until we ensure that smuggling business becomes unattractive to smugglers in Oyo and Osun states.”
