A couple will spend the rest of their lives in jail after raping their toddler daughter and admitting fantasising about abusing their unborn child.
Gerrad Coddington, 25, and Christina Nelson-Coddington, 29, who were sentenced for 29 child sex crimes, handcuffed, beat and sexually assaulted the tragic two-year-old.
Their crimes included rape, child abuse, incest and making child sex abuse images, reports the mirror.co.uk.
The paedophiles from Oklahoma, US, “fantasised about committing incest with their unborn baby”, the court heard.
Attorney General Mike Hunter said he had never seen a worse crime in his time in charge.
He said: “These two individuals engaged in horrifying acts of abuse and violence with innocent children.
“The actions of these two individuals, with regard to the children who were subjected to these horrific acts, unconscionable, unforgivable.
“These are evil people who presented a danger to society. I commend Judge Edwards’ decision to hold them accountable to the fullest extent of the law.
“I applaud the investigators with the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, the investigator in my office with the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force and the attorneys who worked on this case to achieve a successful result.”
Police were tipped-off that a user with the Coddington’s IP address was sending sexually explicit material of children through the Messenger platform.
Investigators found more than 6,000 pages of “incriminating communications” between the couple.
They will never be given the chance to apply for parole, it was confirmed.
