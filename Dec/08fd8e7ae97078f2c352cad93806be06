A pan-Yoruba group, Yoruba Youth Forum (YYF) has warned Oyo state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) against pre-empting outcome of Supreme Court judgement on the 2019 governorship election. Speaking through its President-General, Comrade Abiodun Bolarinwa the group urged APC in the state to stop making statements capable of hitting up the political space, saying that no amount of cheap blackmail or campaign of calumny would declare Adelabu winner of the 2019 gubernatorial election in the State. Bolarinwa said: “Since the ruling of the Appeal Court on the governorship election held in Oyo state, the All Progressives Congress, APC has been making careless statements capable of bringing anarchy in the state where Governor Seyi Makinde is already doing wonders and putting smiles on the faces of the people. The APC should know that, no amount of blackmail will truncate the wishes of the people. The mandate is from God. “Engineer Seyi Makinde is a man of the people. Any attempt by anyindividual or group to remove him from office will fail because he won the 2019 election governorship election in Oyo state. “Oyo 2019 gubernatorial election was free and fair and not like what happened in Kogi or Bayelsa where APC rigged the election. Oyo people loved Engineer Seyi Makinde and voted for him based on his antecedents.” 4
