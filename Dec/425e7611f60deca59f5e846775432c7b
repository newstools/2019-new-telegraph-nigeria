The Economic and Financial Crimes  Commission (EFCC) Tuesday arraigned a former Vice Chancellor of the Federal University of Agriculture Makurdi (FUAM), Prof. Emmanuel  Kucha over an alleged N70 million fraud. He was arraigned before the Federal High Court in Makurdi, the Benue State capital presided over by Justice Mobolaji Olajuwon, on a four-count charge for conspiracy, misappropriation of public funds, abuse of office and gratification. The Zonal Head of Public Affairs of the Commission, Iwayinma Okeanu in a statement made available to newsmen in Makurdi said Prof. Kucha “was alleged to have been involved with obtaining money as bribe in the course of performing his official duties” while in office as Vice Chancellor of the university. One of the charges, according to the statement, read in part: “That you Emmanuel Kucha whilst serving as the Vice Chancellor of Federal University of Agriculture, between 2012 and 2017 in Makurdi within the jurisdiction of this honourable court did accept the total sum of N70, 327,197 million through several payments into your Guaranty Trust Bank Account No: 0124395144 as a bride for performing your official act and thereby committed an offence contrary to section 18 (c) of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000 and punishable under section 18(d) of the same Act.”  The defendant, however, pleaded ‘not guilty’ when the charges were read to him.
