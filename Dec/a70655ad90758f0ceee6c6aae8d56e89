The Minister of State for Petroluem Resources, Timipre Sylva on Tuesday said that the Federal Government under President Muhammadu Buhari was doing everything possible to increase the contribution of the oil sector to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and guarantee the security of oil production. The minister, however, stated that all must take practical steps to ensure that they curtail the various elements that contribute to the high cost of production.  Speaking in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital during the 9th Annual Practical Nigerian Content (PNC) Forum organised by CWC Africa in partnership with the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCBMD) with the theme ‘’Leveraging Local Expertise for Market Growth and Expansion, the minister said that the nation’s cost of production per barrel of crude oil is one of the highest among the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).  Sylva maintained that the Federal Government has expressed concern over the rising cost per barrel of crude oil production in the country, describing it as an anomaly that has eroded the net revenue from crude oil sales and depletes the resources meant for development. He also noted that the Ministry of Petroleum Resources under his supervision has selected key priority areas to contribute to the improve production, low cost of production of crude and the increase in the volume of the production capacity of the country. “The areas include the eradication of smuggling of PMS across Nigerian borders; the completion of the Gas Flare Commercialization Program; increase of crude oil production to 3 million barrels per day and reduction of the cost of crude oil production by at least 5 percent,” he explained.
