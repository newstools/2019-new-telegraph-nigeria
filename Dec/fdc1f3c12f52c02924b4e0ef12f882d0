Yesterday, Sophia Momodu, was dragged by a follower who deemed it fit to task her to acquaint herself with a deserving attention from Davido. The concerned fan had stated that Davido neither like Sophia Momodu’s photos on social media, nor comment on her posts despite that they have a child together. The Instagram user who commented on a photo Sophia Momodu shared, wrote; “What are you doing about Davido and Choima? Are you not going to do anything you this girl , after all you have a child with him, when you upload pix Davido won’t like it or comment and you are his Babymama. That is unfair o, do something to it……. Sophia” Reacting to the comment, Davido’s baby mama wrote: “Wow lol, I don’t care about whatever my ex is doing with his personal life, he’s a great dad and we’re co-parenting just fine that’s all that matters. We’ve moved on dear and you should try to as well. Nothing good comes from holding on to the past.”
