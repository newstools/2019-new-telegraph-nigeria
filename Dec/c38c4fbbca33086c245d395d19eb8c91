A s the lingering crisis in the oil rich community of Ogoni comes to the front burner, a book tilted The Issues of Ogoni People, The Crisis and Solution has come to proffer solution to the long lasting conflicts in the Niger Delta.   Written by Rev Fabeke Douglas, the President of Ogoni Liberation Initiative (OLI), the book x-rays the problem and solutions to the crisis that have engulfed the Niger Delta for many years.   According to Douglas, “very little has been done either to clean up environmental pollution resulting from over three decades of Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) operations or to compensate the communities that are most adversely affected. Late President Musa Yar’Adua stated that agreements have been reached on compensation, but the issues have not even been discussed. A clean-up initiative involving the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has yielded no result.”   The Ogoni Liberation Initiative president urged the Federal Government to take the lead in negotiating a tripartite agreement with the new oil company, and the Ogoni representatives on the benchmarks that must be met before operations begin.   “To include details and modalities for reinvesting a portion of oil revenues in Ogoni land; concrete socio-economic measures to be implemented to revamp basic infrastructure and increase local training and employment; precise processes to control pollution levels and determine reparations, compensation for oil spills and other degradation; and clear commitments from community leaders on the security of oil company staff, installations and equipment. “Agree to a credible and effective programme with UNEP and Ogoni leaders to clean up old spills and pay appropriate compensation to all communities adversely affected by pollution and other oil damages; and economic value; consult and implement urgently the required constitutional amendment and legislative reforms to guarantee more equitable allocation of state resources to benefit all communities in any given federal state, guarantee fair representation of minority groups in those states’ administration and increase those states’ democratic governance through the strengthening of checks and balances on the governor’s powers,” he said.”   He reiterated that the Ogoni Liberation Initiative has taken the pain to make sure relevant information that will ease the quick recovery of Ogoni land is presented in the book, “We are also ready to carry all both Ogoni and Nigeria stake holders along through seeking for constructive advice and fruitful idea to make sure the information presented in this book are practically implemented for the benefit of the Ogoni people and our country Nigeria. We are very sure that President Buhari is ready to resolve the crisis of the Ogoni people, as  we appreciate the President for taken a bold step to flag up one of the most expected project on the implementation of UNEP, but is unfortunate that some people who still serve as a stumbling block against the progress and success of the Ogoni people hindered this good intention of the President to finally clean up Ogoni land whose environment have been messed up and people dying every day as a result of drinking poisonous water, and inhaling polluted air. We are calling on the President to call off and suspend the ‘Clean Up’ project, and carry out thorough investigation, meet with the entire Ogoni stake holders and people, and form and integrate new system that will carry out this project, and implement all the report recommended by the international environmental expert, UNEP.”   The book, which will soon be released to the public, is a detailed research work that will indeed put final stop to the crisis in the Niger Delta if followed to the end.
