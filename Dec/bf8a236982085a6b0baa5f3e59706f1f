*Receives golden award from IYC In order to continue with the legacies and good works of late Diepreye Alamieseigha alive, Mrs Nice Toboulayefa Alamieseigha has through her nongovernmental organisation, Nice Esther for All Foundation, donated some wheel chairs, clutches and other gift items to the physically challenged people in Bayelsa state.
Mrs Nice Alamieseigha, who is the wife of the younger brother of the late Alamieseigha donated the things at Amassoma on Monday as she used the opportunity to unveil her foundation in the state.
She had paid glowing tribute to the late governor of Bayelsa State for blazing the trail for the Ijaw struggle, for resource control and self-determination promising to consolidate on the legacies of the late ljaw hero.
Well known internationally for her humanitarian services, Mrs Alamiesigha said that she has in the last 12 years catered for orphans, widows, destitutes, physically challenged and has provided scholarship, housing scheme, medical care and given out soft loans to the needy.
She said: “My NGO has concluded plans to build an orphanage home in Amassoma in order to make sure a voice is given to the voiceless and dreams are achieved.”
Humbled, however, by the philanthropic gesture of the woman, the Ijaw Youths Council (IYC) led by its president Oweilaemi Peretubo conferred on her the prestigious award of Golden Bride of the Ijaw Nation.
Presenting the Award, Oweilaemi Pereotubo said the IYC was proud to be associated with the life transforming activities of the awardee through empowerment of the disabled, physically challenged, widows and many more that she has been doing in the society.
