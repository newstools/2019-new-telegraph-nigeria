She is loved by her fans because of her boldness. Her ability to fit into any character in movies shot her into lime light and her hard work and resilience have kept her in the movie industry for more than a decade. Added to all these qualities, Nollywood actress, Uche Ogbodo, has a unique sense of style. In this interview with IFEOMA ONONYE, the beautiful actress was not shy to tell the world how much she would love to have more children and her dreams to experience a love based marriage    You recently started producing and acting in your own movies, how well are you getting at it?   Producing movies is something I always wanted to do. I always felt that if I get to the level of a producer, it will spell boundless success in my Career, because then I will be able to choose how to tell my own Stories and shoot according to the picture in my head. So far, I have been able to produce about three movies, two came out beautifully but the first one did not. So far I cannot say I am a wonderful producer yet in terms of getting back all the money I invested in these projects. But I’m still pushing.  Tell us about some of the movies you are working on recently? I am just featuring in other people’s projects and getting paid for it. I feel good working, because acting is my passion. I feel like a totally different person when I’m on set, playing out other people’s lives in characters. I enjoy every bit of it. I love my job so much. And I’m not giving up on it in a hurry.  For your birthday photo shoot this year, you shot down the social media with semi-nude photos, why did you choose that kind of shoot to celebrate? Was it because others do so?   <img class="size-medium wp-image-282071 alignleft" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/%E2%80%93Uche-Ogbodo-300x150.png?resize=300%2C150&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="150" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/–Uche-Ogbodo.png?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/–Uche-Ogbodo.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1">I have been in this entertainment industry for over a decade, and if you follow my brand you will see that I am not one to do what others do. I am in my own lane. I set my own trends, from my hair to my appearance, to my Personality. I can never copy anyone. People copy me. I set trends and they follow. I don’t follow trends.  So it’s absurd to say I did my nude photo shoot because others did it. Please go back and check the dates, you will see I gave the others mind to feel comfortable in their bodies.  I did it first and they followed suit. My brand is about strength and courage, will power to be yourself and express yourself freely, especially women who are insecure about themselves due to fear the society has infringed in them. I give hope to the hopeless and a voice to the Mute! Speak your truth! It is after all your truth!   Tell us a little about the kind of hair colours that you love. We have seen you tint your hair gold, red and other colours, what is your natural hair colour? My natural hair colour is brown. But like I said earlier, I love living spontaneously. It is fun. I get bored being one person for long. So I change my looks a lot to lift my spirits and be happy. If it takes me changing any part of me to be that way that’s what I’m going to do, because at the end of the day I’m not hurting anyone. Many of your fans see you as a crazy stylish actress, are they right?  They might be right. But leave the crazy part out. I am only Fashion crazy. Life aspect I am actually really reserved and gentle. I don’t have the Heart to do the real crazy stuffs.   You once said that being a single mother is a tedious job, are you looking forward to get married again and have move children? I have never been married and I will love to experience what true marriage feels like. I would love to have a complete f a m i l y with a m a n I love wholeheartedly. And have more Children. I will love to have two more children by God’s grace. I already have one as a Single Mum. If it pleases God I want two more with a man who loves me.   How many children more do you wish to have? Boys or girls?   I’m not about Sexes. I just want children, either boys or girls. It won’t be bad to balance out. I would love one boy and one girl more.  You are one of the pioneer actresses in Nollywood; tell us how you have been able to maintain your relevance in the industry so far…   I would not consider myself a pioneer actress In Nollywood. Although I am already 13 years in the Industry but Nollywood is more than 25 years old. About being or remaining relevant, I am sure it’s hard work and God’s grace that has kept me here. I am so grateful.   Many actresses tell different stories on how they found themselves acting in movies, some say they were bored at home due to no job and decided to go  for auditions while a few dreamt of being famous, what is your own story, How did the acting career journey start for you?  I really never thought I would be an actress at all. When I finished Secondary school, I wrote JAMB and was hoping to get admission into University to read Law. I really have always wanted to do Law but God had other plans for me. I found myself in Nollywood. The thing is that my Dad felt I had it in me to do well in Acting and he took me to Nollywood and registered me.   Back then when you joined nollywood, parents were too conservative about their girl child being to exposed, how did your parents view your going into acting back then?   My case was different back then because it was my parents that encouraged me to be in Nollywood. I am so Lucky to be blessed with parents that support other than condemn. My father is my Number one Fan. He watches all my Jobs and criticizes my acting. And my Mother is equally too supportive of me. They encourage me to stand strong and keep pushing harder for relevance.    Where you one of the few actresses that shuttled between school and auditions and casting?   Initially, it was so for me but it became too hard for me to continue hustling between School and Nollywood because my Dad was having difficult times and he told me I should drop out and focus on one. So I had to face Nollywood with all my heart.   As someone who has been in the industry from way back, what were some of the rules you learned in the career that many new actresses are yet to understand?   Well there are really no binding rules in Nollywood but I have learnt some life lessons in the industry that I apply in my work and my life in general. I only advise people or up-comers to keep an open mind. Don’t ever take anything too personal. There are no permanent friends, and no permanent enemies in this industry.  Have you ever been intimidated by new, pretty younger actresses?  I never get intimidated by anyone.  There is hardly any controversy or scandal about you, how have you maintained this?  I just live my life the way my parents t a u g h t me to. I am not too extra so I don’t go seeking unnecessary attention. I am a hard worker so I concentrate more on the job than the drama.   Behind every successful career, there is always another hobby or different career the person also loves as much as the one that gave him or her fame, what other careers interests you aside acting?   I love fitness. I love to work out. So I am seeking a career path in that. Also I love anything business, so interesting business ideas interests me.   One of the things that kept your fans attention on you was your figure back in the days, what prompted your working on your weight?  Childbirth changed my whole figure and I could barely recognize myself when I look in the mirror. And my Career would suffer hard if I had remained that way so I had to work on myself.  How do you feel after losing some pounds?  I feel really great and more confident.  There was a time it seemed most of the movie roles you were given were to seduce friend’s husband or boyfriend, so much that some fans thought that is who you really are outside the movie scene, do you like such roles and how do you manage public opinion about it?   Well it’s my job, and I owe it to my craft, my fans and my producers to be good at it. So when I get such roles I put in all my best into interpreting it very well that it makes my fans assume that’s who I might be in real life. Please I am single, and I love to mingle with singles like myself. What business do I have hanging with someone else’s husband or boyfriend. Hell No. I don’t take people’s men.   Meeting you outside movie locations, what side of Uche Ogbodo will we be meeting?  Meeting me outside the movie Scene, you will be meeting the real me. You will meet the Uche Ogbodo without the drama, the good girl, the mama’s girl, the drama free girl. But when you meet me at a movie location, you will be witnessing the GODDESS my alter ego. You will meet the Actress, the drama queen. The bad Girl hahahahaha.  What are your plans this Christmas?   I intend to Rest more. Enjoy the holiday with Family. But I’m going to be indoors most of the time to Rest because I have been over working myself; I need a lot of rest.   What dreams are you looking forward to in 2020 next year?  I have not started writing out my 2020 dreams yet. But now you mentioned it, I better start penning something down.
