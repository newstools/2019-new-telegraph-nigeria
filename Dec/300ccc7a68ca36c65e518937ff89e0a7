From Cajetan Mmuta, Benin The spirit of love, hope and joy being canvassed by leaders across the country may have been defeated as the  National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former Edo State Governor, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole at Christmas eve rejected gifts from the state government. The latest development is a clear pointer of the worsening feud between Governor Godwin Obaseki and his estranged political godfather Comrade Adams Oshiomhole ahead of next yearâ€™s gubernatorial election. Obaseki is seeking for a second term in office. Both Oshiomhole and Obaseki had a few months ago blamed the crisis rocking the ruling APC in the state on the media. It was learnt that messengers from the Government House, Benin were dispatched to deliver the conventional Christmas presents reserved for former governors of Edo State to Comrade Oshiomhole but were turned back.
