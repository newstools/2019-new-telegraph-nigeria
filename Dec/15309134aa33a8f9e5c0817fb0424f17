The Kogi/Niger Command of the Nigeria Customs Service has vowed to use all necessary mechanisms to fish out the bandits who killed its officers who were carrying out their lawful duties in Kogi State. In a statement signed by the Public Relations Officer, Lomba Benjamin and made available to the New Telegraph on Tuesday, the Customs Area Controller, Abba-Kassim Yusuf urged aggrieved Nigerians whose goods were impounded to engage the services of the court rather than resort to violence. While assuring families of the officers killed that the management will deploy all necessary mechanisms to ensure the perpetrators of this evil act are brought to book, Yusuf said: “This sad event will not distract us from vigorously discharging our statutory functions.” It will be recalled that a team of patrol officers were attacked by armed bandits along Lokoja-Okene road on Thursday, December 12 resulting to the death of two officers, ASC I, S. Ohiremen and ASC I, S.M Omale, while another officer, DSC, H.I Oladapo sustained a gunshot injury. The statement disclosed that the injured officer was quickly moved to the Federal Medical Centre, Lokoja for medical attention, discharged from the hospital and would be returning to work as soon as he is in full health.
