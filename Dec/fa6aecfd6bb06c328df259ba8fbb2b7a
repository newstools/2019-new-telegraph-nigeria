Nollywood superstar, Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde, made a not so appropriate statement on the red carpet at the just concluded premiere of Your Excellency movie by Mo Abudu. When asked to give a shout out to Eniola Badmus TV, the mother of four asked…“Oh Eniola Badmus, that’s an actress, isn’t she?” Well, the response did not go down well with Eniola Badmus and she reacted by posting the video on her Instagram page with the caption: “I will work harder to the point that I will need no introduction thank you for reminding me to put in more work.” Omotola’s statement about Eniola has since sparked mixed reactions from her colleagues. Yvonne Jegede wrote; “Honey you are doing fine. Your hustle is pure. You have gone places, your name opens doors, keep your head up.” Actor Femi Brainard on the other hand wrote; “Knowing what I know, did not just watch this………my lafta is not of a happy one.”
