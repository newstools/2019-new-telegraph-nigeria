Deviant as ever, a faction of the Edo State chapter of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Friday at a mega rally held in Benin the state capital received into its fold a former Governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2016 election,  Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu and thousands of his supporters. National Chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshoomhole and members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party were conspicuously absent at the rally. Besides, Edo State government Friday placed a total ban on political rallies, demonstration and processions in the state over rising security concerns occasioned by the spike in protests around Benin metropolis. The mega rally was shifted and attended by a mammoth crowd of APC leaders, elders, members, support groups who converged on the imposing residence of Pastor Ize-Iyamu at Ugbor Government Reservation Area amid tight security by armed mobile and regular policemen. The mega rally was initially slated to hold at the Garrick Memorial Secondary School but was later taken to Ize-Iyamu’s house at Ugbor Quarters of the GRA. This is despite the last minute suspension order by the Inspector General of Police, IGP Mohammed Adamu following violent clashes by youths loyal to the National chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshoomhole and those of the state governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki close to the party secretariat on Airport road in the capital town on Thursday evening. Members of the APC, who thronged the venue of the rally, were drawn from across the various wards in the 18 local government areas of the state. Present at the mega rally were the former deputy governor of the state, Dr. Pius Odubu, factional state Chairman of the party, Col. David Imuse (rtd), members of the Edo Peoples Movement (EPM), Chief Lucky Imasuen, Rep member Johnson Oghuma and several other chieftains of the party.
