Barely a week after the National President of Nigeria Union of Journalists, (NUJ) Chris Isiguzo adjudged Niger State as one of the journalist-friendly states, men of the state Police Command on Tuesday assaulted the state correspondent of Channels Television, Mr Emperor Simon. Also the organisation’s cameraman attached to the Niger State office, Abdullahi Egba was assaulted and whisked away by the police. According to Simon, the Channel’s team were in Tafa Local Government for a follow up story on the disappearance of the Returning Officer for the local government in the Saturday’s council election when the incident happened. He said the team ran into a protest by youths who were expressing their misgivings over the cancellation of the outcome of the poll over the alleged disappearance of the Returning Officer and was caught in the commotion. “No sooner had the protesters started blocking the Kaduna Abuja highway that the Policemen at the Tafa Local Government Secretariat started shooting sporadically into the air to disperse the crowd. Accordingly, he said: “The police used ‘canisters, live ammunition’ to disperse protesters, adding that “they also beat me up with stick and gun butts. They whisked my cameraman and he is being held at the Divisional headquarters in Sabon Wuse.” The State Chapter of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) condemned the “harassment” and “intimidation” of its members who are on lawful duties.
