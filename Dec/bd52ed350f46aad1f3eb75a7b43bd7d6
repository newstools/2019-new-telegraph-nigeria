New Telegraph reports that the governor, had, on December 3, promised to unveil the list of his commissioners before Christmas. Abiodun’s promise came on the heels of criticisms over the failure of his administration to constitute a cabinet since taking power on May 29, 2019. “Between now and Christmas, all those speculations (about who made the list or didn’t) will be put to rest,” the governor had declared at a luncheon organised for critical stakeholders in Abeokuta.
