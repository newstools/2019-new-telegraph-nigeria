He said that the need for transport leaders to jointly fight against road crashes in ember months and beyond had called for concern. “No transport Union should convey any corp member and those leaving the orientation camp on Thursday, December 19, 2019 from 6pm.
”Any vehicle that violates this order will be dealt with seriously as the FRSC is committed to the safety of lives and properties. “I want to urge the State Coordinators of different NYSC orientation camps to send signals to the Corps members to be aware of the information. ”This has become necessary to address road accidents and crashes that occur during the festive period across the country. The safety of the youths, goods and Nigerian lives at large is our major concern,” he said. The Corps Marshal, however, urged the NYSC members to use legal parks and avoid road side vehicles to ensure their safety while traveling for Christmas and New Year. Brig.-Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, the Director-General, NYSC, appealed to the transport union workers to give discount to corps members traveling for Christmas and New Year.
Ibrahim warned corps members against unauthorised journeys, boarding vehicles at the road side and late night travels.
