 T he Ogun State Police Command has arrested three members of a syndicate, who allegedly specialised in vandalising masts of telecommunications companies in Ibafo area of the state. The suspects, Adeola Oyesanya, Bashiru Mohammed and Musa Mohammed, were nabbed on Saturday and 12 stolen batteries recovered from them.   The batteries, which are suspected to have been stolen from the masts, were valued at about N1.8million.  The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, who confirmed the incident in a statement yesterday said the suspects have all confessed to the crime. According to him, the suspects have been in the business of vandalising telecommunications masts for quite some time now.  Oyeyemi explained that the suspects were arrested following a report by a security guard attached to a MTN mast in Papa-Ibafo area that a group of thieves invaded the site, vandalised and carted away 12 batteries valued at about N1.8 million. Oyeyemi explained: “On receiving the report, the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in charge of Ibafo Police Station, a Superintendent of Police (SP), Abiodun Ayinde, quickly mobilised his anti-robbery men and moved to the scene. On sighting the policemen, the suspects abandoned their loot and escaped to nearby bush. The entire area was subsequently cordoned off by the policemen and the bush properly combed, leading to the arrest of the first suspect, Oyesanya. His arrest led to the arrest of the other two suspects who are receivers of the stolen goods.”  Oyeyemi, however, said that the state Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, has ordered the transfer of the suspects to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID) for further investigation and prosecution.
