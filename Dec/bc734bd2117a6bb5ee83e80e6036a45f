The trial of the embattled General Manager of the Kwara State Television Authority, Alhaji Abdulfatai Adewale Adebowale, for alleged N4m land fraud continued on Thursday with a prosecution witness, Sulyman Abdulkareem, narrating how he paid the sum of N2.3m into the account of the defendant. He said: “My Lord, after the allocation of 10 plots of land to the staff of the Kwara State Television Authority, the General Manager of the station, Alhaji Abdulfatai Adewale Adebowale approached the Director General of the Kwara State Bureau of Land that, there was no way the 10 plots could be shared among the staff, let them sell it and bring the money. “The DG now linked me with the defendant who instructed me to look for buyers. I sold about four plots for N2.3m. I then contacted Adebowale who told me to bring the cash, but I said, no. I requested for his account number for proper records, and I paid the money into his Stanbic IBTC account.” The Ilorin Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) is prosecuting Adebowale on a six-count charge bordering on corrupt practices before Justice Sikiru Oyinloye of the Kwara State High Court sitting in Ilorin. Further hearing in the case has been adjourned till January 14, 2020 for cross examination of the witness.
