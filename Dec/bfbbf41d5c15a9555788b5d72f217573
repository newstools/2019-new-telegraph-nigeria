President Muhammadu Buhari is committed to the restructuring of the country but would only welcome it if is carried out by the National Assembly. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu disclosed this Friday in Abuja while presenting a paper “The executive/legislative relationship: role of the media” at a forum organised by the House of Representatives Press Corps. He said the National Assembly being made up of elected representatives of the people is an embodiment of the sovereignty of Nigerian and should be allowed to exercise its powers. “The Parliament is a very important component of democracy and it represents the sovereignty of the people. And that is why we tell those who clamour for restructuring that you cannot do it outside of the Parliament. “You cannot circumvent the Parliament. If you don’t have confidence in the Parliament, wait after four years you can vote in representatives you want,” he stated. According to him: “President Muhammadu Buhari has always believed in restructuring and he is interested in the nation’s restructuring and if you look at the APC constitution, you will see our stand on restructuring.” On the recently passed budget, the presidential spokesman said President Buhari was committed to the full implementation of the 2020 budget assuring that it will be assented to. “I don’t know when the National Assembly will transmit the budget to the president. But I want to assure you that Mr. President is committed to signing the budget and returning the budget circle to January to December. “Of course, when the budget comes, it is taken to the Council where ministers clearly identify their budgets and due diligence is done. And the executive and legislature have all agreed to work together for the benefit of the nation,” he said.
