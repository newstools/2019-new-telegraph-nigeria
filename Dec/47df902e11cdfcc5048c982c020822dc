We’ve all heard the saying, ‘Diamonds are a girl’s best friend’, but Jada Dubai and Passion Jewellers just made diamond, a girl’s best shoes!  Jada Dubai’s new ‘Passion Diamond Shoes’, elegant stilettos made from real gold and embellished with two round 15-carat D-flawless diamonds are said to be the most expensive pair of shoes in the world.  Each shoe is trimmed with 118 smaller round diamonds and features one of the impressive crowning jewels prong-set near the pointed toe. Everything about the “Passion Diamond Shoes” exudes luxury. Even the insoles are inscribed in gold. Jada Dubai’s record-setting shoes, which were designed in coordination with Dubai-based Passion Jewellers, took nearly nine months to create.  “Jada Dubai designs only shoes with diamonds,” said the company’s co-founder, Maria Majari. “For the launch of our second collection, we wanted to create a piece that is truly unique in the world using very rare diamonds.” While the prototype shoes are shown in size 5.5, those who place an order will receive a custom pair in the requested size.  The record for the world’s most expensive shoes was previously held by a $15.1 million pair conceived by British designer Debbie Wingham in October of 2017.
