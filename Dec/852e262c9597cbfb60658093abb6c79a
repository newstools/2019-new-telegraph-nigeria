The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, on Tuesday said in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, that efforts were ongoing to reduce the use of lethal weapons by unscrupulous persons in the country to situations that are extremely unavoidable. In his lecture with the theme: ‘Security and Protection of System: The Challenge of Policing in Nigeria,’ delivered at the 2019 Town Talk Lecture, organised by the University of Ibadan Alumni Association, UI chapter, Adamu, who was represented by the Deputy Inspector-General of Police (DIG) in charge of Research and Training, Mr. Peter Ogunyanwo, said the use of electro-muscular disruption technology, which is commonly known as teaser or stun guns, was being considered  to reduce cases of misuse of firearms, accidental discharges and extra-judicial killings. According to him, the efforts would help in enhancing community policing and police-public partnership. The Assistant Inspector-General of Police in charge of Zone 11, comprising Oyo, Osun and Ondo States, Adeleye Oyebade; and Commissioner of Police in Oyo State, Shina Olukolu, were also in attendance. Ogunyanwo listed challenges of policing in Nigeria to include inadequate or poor funding due to endemic and systemic corruption, manpower shortage, inferior fire power, inadequate technology, lack of public trust, training and retraining deficiency, poor condition of service, unnecessary political interference, and unhealthy rivalry among sister agencies. He, however, said that: “Regardless the daunting challenges facing policing in Nigeria, I can assure you that we are on the right path towards surmounting them with the right leadership provided by the current Inspector-General of Police and with the solid support from President Muhammadu Buhari.” Adamu, stated that the presidential approval of yearly recruitment of 10,000 police officers for five consecutive years, if religiously followed through, would help in bridging the manpower gap.
