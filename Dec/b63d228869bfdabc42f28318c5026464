The management of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) on Tuesday failed to defend the N1.2 billion allegedly missing from the coffers of the Corporation. The NRC management appeared before the Hon  Wole Oke led House of Representatives Committee on Public Accounts to respond to an audit query raised by the office of the Accountant General of the Federation between the 2013 and 2014 financial years. The House committee stepped down the presentation of the duo of Mrs O Osunmade and Alhaji A Niyi who represented the Corporation at the sitting for “misrepresentation of facts before the Parliament”. According to the Chairman of the committee, Hon. Oke ” these documents before this honourable Committee can not stand the test of time “What these officials are telling this Committee are different entirely form what contained in the documents the Corporation submitted from us “We will have to step down their matter for misrepresentation of facts, consequently, a sub committee  will be set up to look into the financial books and the activities of the Corporation for accountability  “Also the Secretariat should write officially to the minister of finance and the governor of the Central of Nigeria (CBN), to provide the Committee the detailed financial accounts of the Corporation in the period under review to guide the Committee in the course of its investigation of the missing money.” The committee frowned at the request of the Corporation that it should be allowed to go back to study books and to come back for more details, saying  that was not acceptable
