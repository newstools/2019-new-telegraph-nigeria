 E bonyi State House of Assembly, yesterday decried deplorable state of Hatchery Road in Abakaliki metropolis in the state, urging the State Road Maintenance Agency to salvage the deplorable situation.  A member representing Abakaliki North constituency in the Assembly, Mrs. Franca Okpo described the road as very deplorable when she moved a motion during the Assembly plenary.  The motion was seconded by Hon. Oliver Osi representing Ivo constituency.  Okpo while moving the motion said “Ebonyi State has become the fastest growing State in Nigeria because of the good road network, but to say that this Hatchery road is in a bad shape is to be mild.  “This particular road leads to Ebonyi State House of Assembly complex here, Federal Teaching Hospital Abakaliki, (FETHA II), Abakaliki Local Government Headquarters, Ebonyi State Broadcasting Corporation (EBBC), Ebonyi State Hatchery and other important places in the State.”  Speaker of the Assembly, Hon. Francis  Nwifuru  while reacting to the motion urged the state Road Maintenance Agency to immediately move to the road and rehabilitate it.  “The issue of the dilapidated nature of Hatchery road is very known to all of us but we’re already building so many projects that need attention. I think we have a Road Maintenance Agency and we ask them to move to that road and repair areas that need to be repaired.  “If we continue building new roads, we may have many uncompleted projects. We must be very conscious of taking in new projects. So, the Chairman, House Committee on Infrastructure and Concession, Hon. Joseph Ununu, should as a matter of urgency inform the Agency of the need torepair that road.”
