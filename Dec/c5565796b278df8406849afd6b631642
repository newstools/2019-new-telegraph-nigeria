 …Says coy paid N50bn so far   The House of Representatives has directed the construction company, Julius Berger Nigeria Plc to submit a monthly progress report on the multi-billion naira Abuja-Kano and Lagos-Ibadan highways. Chairman of the House Committee on Works, Hon. Abubakar Kabir Abubakar, who disclosed this Thursday in Abuja, said this was part of the resolution reached at a meeting with representatives of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing and management of Julius Berger Nigeria Limited. He said the Julius Berger confirmed to the committee that it has so far received N50, 856,044,301,27 representing 32 percent of the total saying but the “work progress is at 26.7percent after 18 months into the 36 month completion period.” According to Abubakar: “The committee doubts the strongly the capacity of Julius Berger Plc to deliver the remaining 73.3 percent in the next 18 months.” Consequently, the committee directed the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing to consider the option of involving other contractors to handle different sections of the road to ensure the project is completed on time and save lives and property. The meeting also resolved that Julius Berger should immediately open up the completed but closed portions on the Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano road and to minimize and streamline road diversions as advised by the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC).
