The hardworking Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde, explored his soft side days ago during an interaction with students of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) during a recent visit. The governor, who continues to resonate with the people through his visionary style of governance and purposeful leadership, was laying out his action plan to the students which he said would be the panacea for the lingering crisis of the university.  As he spoke, a few students here and there interrupted him, like they did to immediate past governor of the state, Abiola Ajimobi in a viral video a few years ago. But unlike Ajimobi, who delivered his now famous “Constituted Authority” “Are you a student too?” “What course are you doing?” and “Bring that boy for me” among others, Makinde simply, jokingly said: “All these things you people are doing, can you do them in front of Constituted Authority?” It led to an eruption of laughter as the students, lecturers and other stakeholders of the university cheered him.  In tweets accompanying the event, Governor Makinde wrote: “We visited the Ladoke Akintola University, Ogbomoso (LAUTECH), this morning to meet with all stakeholders, in order to resolve the current crisis which resulted in strike action by staff on November 18, 2019.”  In another, he said: “I assured them Oyo State would intervene in the current crisis so studies can resume, if the various staff unions reach an agreement on how to utilise the intervention fund. However, I told them we need their support to implement a lasting solution to the university’s challenges.”  Finally, he noted: “We believe our proposal for sole ownership for LAUTECH is the solution the university needs. I reiterated that this was not a rejection of Osun State people as our brothers and sisters but a pragmatic solution, as Oyo State is financially prepared to shoulder the responsibility.”
