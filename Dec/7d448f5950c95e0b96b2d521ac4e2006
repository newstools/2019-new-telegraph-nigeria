• As Gov, Industry Minister, Dangote visit BUA Factory in Lafiagi Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq and Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment Adeniyi Adebayo on Thursday toured the BUA sugar refinery and plantation in Lafiagi, Kwara State, amid assurances by AbdulRazaq that the state is open to business.
They were joined on the tour of the facility by Africa’s richest man Aliko Dangote; Chairman of the BUA conglomerate Abdulsamad Rabiu; and other top players in the corporate business community in Nigeria.
“I welcome you all to Kwara. We are open to business. Ours is to assist you and ease the business environment for you so that you can invest more in Kwara. Our doors are open. We will make sure to keep you in Kwara,” AbdulRazaq said at the Lafiagi site of the multimillion dollar sugar refinery under construction by the BUA Group.
That comes a day after the governor said the state would scale up its security arrangements as part of its overall strategy to attract more investments.
Adebayo said the factory aptly keys into the Muhammadu Buhari administration’s campaign for local content, food security and less reliance on importation of goods.
