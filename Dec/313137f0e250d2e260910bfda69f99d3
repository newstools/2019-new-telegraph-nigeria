There was panic on Sunday along Ikorodu Road as a fire gutted Owode Onirin Market, destroying valuables worth millions of naira and consumed 30 shops. Confirming the incident, Director-General of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Dr. Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu said though no life was lost in the inferno, valuable goods including 30 shops were burnt. It was learnt that the fire started from the metal segment of the market. Osanyintolu said: “On arrival at the incident scene, we found out that the fire emanated from one of the several lines of shop within the market. The cause of the fire is unknown as there was no power supply within the market. “No lives lost but valuables destroyed while the fire has been curtailed from spreading. Osanyintolu added that enumerating exercise would be done when the fire is totally extinguished. He said that the cause of the fire was yet to be known as power surge could not be given because there had not been power supply to the market since 2017.
