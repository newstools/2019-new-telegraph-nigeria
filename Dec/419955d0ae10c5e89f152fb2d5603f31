A Federal High Court in Lagos has again ordered the temporary forfeiture of two houses situated in Ilorin, Kwara State belonging to a former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, to the Federal Government.
Justice Rilwan Aikawa made the order after granting an ex-parte motion filed by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) pursuant to Section 17 of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Related Offences Act No. 14, 2006.
The order is coming less than two months after Justice Mohammed Liman of the same court directed the interim forfeiture of two Lagos property owned by Saraki to the Federal Government.
The two property were designated as; Nos 17 and 17A McDonald Road, Ikoyi in Eti-Osa Local Government Area of Lagos State.
The latest order, however, affected Saraki’s property situated at Plots 10 and 11 Abdulkadir Road, GRA, Ilorin, Kwara State.
Arguing the ex-parte motion, EFCC’s lawyer, Rotimi Oyedepo, alleged that Saraki acquired the two properties with proceeds of unlawful activities.
He said the EFCC uncovered monumental fraud perpetrated in the treasury of the Kwara State Government between 2003 and 2011, when Saraki was governor of the state.
He added that the court is empowered by Section 17 of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Related Offences Act No. 14, 2006, to order the temporary forfeiture of the property to government.
After listening to Oyedepo, Justice Aikawa granted the order as prayed. In granting the request, the judge equally directed the anti-graft agency to publish the temporary forfeiture order in a national daily for anyone interested in the property to show cause why permanent forfeiture order should not be made on them.
Further hearing in the matter has been adjourned to December 17.
