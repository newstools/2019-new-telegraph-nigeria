Steve Uzoechi, Owerri The Supreme Court on Friday quashed the appeal of former Governor Rochas Okorocha’s son in-law, Uche Nwosu, inferring that Nwosu was never a candidate of any party, for the governorship of Imo State. Addressing a press conference in Owerri, the Imo State capital, the National Chairman of the Action Peoples Party (APP) and spokesman of the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere daid that the apex court had affirmed the argument of the APP that Uche Nwosu was never at any point, a candidate for the Imo governorship election. Though Justice Rhodes Vivour presided, but in a unanimous judgment read by Justice Amina Augie, the court in a suit filed by the Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere-led APP, held that by virtue of Uche Nwosu’s double candidature and in line with the clear provisions of the Electoral Act, he was bound to be disqualified from the election and thereby affirmed the judgments of the High Court and the Court of Appeal. Reacting to the judgment, Ikenga said: “Just a few minutes ago, the apex court finally quashed the over bloated governorship ambition of Uche Nwosu, the son-in-law of former Governor Rochas Okorocha and his stooge through which Okorocha would have continued his stranglehold on the resources of Imo State and technically be holding office for a third term.” He declared that Imo State was finally liberated from the Okorocha dynasty which for eight years fleeced and destroyed the state. He expressed joy that his Party was the one that sealed the fate of the Okorochas and freed Imo from their shackles. He also called on the EFCC and the ICPC to take advantage of the judgment, which has permanently stripped Uche Nwosu of his planned immunity, and investigate him, Senator Rochas Okorocha and their ilks with a view to recovering every penny stolen by them from Imo State.
