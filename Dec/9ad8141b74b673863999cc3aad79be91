Donnald Trump has been charged with two articles of impeachment that could see him ousted from office over claims he abused his power and obstructed Congress. Democrat Chair of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Jerry Nadler revealed the articles – akin to charges – in Washington DC Tuesday. And House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff said Trump had committed ‘high crimes and misdemeanors.’ Nadler claimed that the president had imperiled US national security by trying to get Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate political rival Joe Biden’s son in return for a White House invite, as well as $400m in military aid. The obstruction of Congress charge centers around claims that Trump tried to frustrate the investigation into his alleged abuse of power during his communications with Zelensky. Nadler accused Trump of putting himself ‘consistently above country’. He said there is a ‘clear remedy for presidents who so violate their oath of office – that is impeachment.’ Schiff then explained the Democrats’ reasoning behind the articles, saying that President Trump ‘abused the power of his office to get a foreign power to help his reelection.’ He further attacked Trump’s alleged ‘willingness to sacrifice US national security for his own interests.’ He added: ‘No one is above the law: not even the President of the United States.’ Wheelchair user, 62, struck and killed by hit and run driver Trump is only the fourth president in US history to face impeachment. The articles unveiled today will now be voted on by members of the lower house of the US Congress, the House of Representatives.
