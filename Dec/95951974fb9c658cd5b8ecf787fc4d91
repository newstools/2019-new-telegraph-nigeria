From: Cephas Iorhemen, Makurdi Barely three years to the end of the eight-year tenure of Governor Samuel Ortom, former National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Barnabas Gemade has kicked off moves to launch himself into the 2023 gubernatorial race to take over power from the incumbent governor. Senator Gemade, who represents Benue North East in the red chamber of the National Assembly from 2011 to 2019, disclosed this in an interview in his Gboko residence. The former Minister of Works in President Ibrahim Babangida’s administration, said there is mounting pressure on him from the zone and and state at large to contest the election, he is still consulting with relevant stakeholders and was expecting a positive answer from God to have a smooth sailing into government house. He particularly pointed that his track record of achievements while in the senate and other public offices have placed him in a vantage position above other intending aspirants in the zone to clinch the seat in the coming governorship election. “My scorecard is so large and convincing enough for Benue people to want me to be their governor as you can see the pressure now even as 2023 is still far from here. For example, in my two tenures at the red chambers, I delivered over 360 projects in my constituency apart from over 10,000 items I distributed and lots more,” he said.
