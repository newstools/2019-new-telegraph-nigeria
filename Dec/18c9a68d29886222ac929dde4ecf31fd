The National President of Campaign for Dignity in Governance (CDG), Comrade Razak Olokoba, has urged Nigerians to appreciate the efforts of President Muhammadu Buhari and his team towards ensuring stability of polity in the country. Olokoba, in a chat with newsmen in Lagos wondered why people who develop penchant for condemning bad government should not equally develop spirit for praising good governance, reminding that, Buhari’s administration’s performance has shored up the country’s rating in the eyes of international community. The renowned social commentator cited example of the Minister for Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola (SAN), whose ministry, according to him, has been making the nation proud with its efforts at giving the country a befitting road networks, which are already yielding fruitful results. Against this background, the activist saidthat the performance of minister had passed dignity test again for the last quarter of the year 2019 under review. “The glorious achievement on the brand new road networks across the country, praised by everybody including the opposition, 2nd Niger Bridge, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway are other good examples of Fahola’s continuous achievements in office,” the statement asserted. Olokoba reminded that, Fashola had revived National Housing Programme that was abandoned 34 years ago with mortgage scheme that would guarantee affordable shelter for Nigerians, he further urged Buhari to continue to ignore the antics of suspected paid agents of the fifth columnist and a member of Pull Down Buhari Movement (PDBM), by continuing on the path of progress he had embarked. According to him, the administration is already achieving its quest to make Nigerians happy through paying the desired attention to security issues in the country, saying, the coastal lines are making vehicular patrol of security agents possible. The CDG boss therefore further urged the President to continue ignoring detractors and their likes whose trademarks were destabilisation agenda just as it warned the suspected detractors to desist from acting as salaried agents and commissioned personnel of the Antipeople and anti-good governance agents. Olokoba therefore urged all Nigerians to give this administration a huge support to steer the national ship to the promise land, reminding that governance is a collective responsibility and not an exclusive duty of a single person.
