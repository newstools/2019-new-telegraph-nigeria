…as strategy sets to address 4 security concerns The alliance between Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP), necessitated the holistic review of the 2014 National Security Srategy (NSS).
National Security Adviser (NSA), Maj-Gen. Babagana Monguno (rtd), made the disclosure, Monday, in Abuja, at the stakeholders workshop for the sensitisation session of the NSS, 2014.
The NSA disclosed that the document, which essentially built upon that of 2014, was people-centred, even as he added that the sensisitation was the first phase towards the implementation of the strategy document.
Specifically, the NSA noted that the new Strategy underscored the urgent need to address the socio-economic concerns such as corruption, which breeds poverty and unemployment, insecurity and the diversification of the economy, which are the three key objectives, which he said,  were the key objectives of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration.
Apart from being citizen-based, the NSS 2019 seeks to promote sustainable development, national unity, as well as focus on regional and international interests.
