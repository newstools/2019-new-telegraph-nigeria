One of Nigeria’s leading musicians, Tiwa Savage, has joined her colleague, Davido, in accusing the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA) of fraudulently manipulating videos in which they appeared.  After Davido appeared in a video promoting COZA’s January programme, the singer on Wednesday night disowned the video and threatened to initiate legal proceedings if it is not retracted immediately.  Tiwa, who also appeared in one of the videos for COZA, said on Thursday via social media platforms that she does not endorse the church’s events.  “It has been brought to my attention that there is a viral video which includes me advertising an upcoming COZA event. I want to state that I have nothing to do with the Church and certainly do not endorse their events,” she said.  The 39-year-old added: “I’m extremely disappointed that I was fraudulently approached to simply comment on how good God has been to me and it has been wrongly edited to use my image to create an advert to deceive people. COZA this is wrong. I will be taking action if this is not immediately retracted.”  The issue has been a subject of debate on social media. COZA senior pastor, Biodun Fatoyinbo, who has been under the public radar since he was accused of rape by celebrity photographer, Busola Dakolo, is yet to reply to the allegations.  B o t h Wizkid and Dav i d o h a d earlier called out the church about the promotional videos.
