L a Liga leaders Barcelona played out an entertaining draw with fourth-placed Real Sociedad.  Mikel Oyarzabal gave the hosts the lead with a penalty after Sergio Busquets fouled Diego Llorente, but Antoine Griezmann equalised with a clipped finish against his former club.  Luis Suarez then put Barca ahead from Lionel Messi’s unselfish pass. But Alexander Isak equalised as he fired home after Marc-Andre ter Stegen parried Nacho Monreal’s cross-shot, reports the BBC.  Real Sociedad were probably the better team with 53% possession and 19 shots to Barca’s nine. Martin Odegaard, on loan from Real Madrid, was a key influence on the game although none of his five shots were on target. Barca go one point clear of Real Madrid, who visit Valencia on Sunday (20:00 GMT). The old rivals meet in El Clasico on Wednesday.
