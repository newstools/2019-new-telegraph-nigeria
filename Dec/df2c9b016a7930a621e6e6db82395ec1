The management of EKiti State University in Ado-EKiti (EKSU) said it has ratified the dismissal of a lecturer, Mr. Olola Olaleye Aduwo, who allegedly sexually harassed a female student of the institution.  Two other lecturers were also dismissed for abandoning their duty posts. Aduwo, Lecturer 1 in the Department of Accounting, was found guilty of sexually harassing a female student of his department.  A statement on Friday by the Head, Directorate of Information and Corporate affairs of the university, Mr. Bode Olofinmuagun, stated that: “The University Governing Council, at its 135th meeting held on 5th December approved the recommendations of the Senior Staff Disciplinary Committee (Academic) that recommended the dismissal.”  It will be recalled that Aduwo was recorded in a video that went viral a few months ago being molested for sexually harassing a female student. The university, thereafter, instituted a preliminary investigation panel, which forwarded its findings to the school management.  The findings were later considered by the Senior Staff Disciplinary Committee, which found overwhelming evidence against the lecturer who was then invited to appear before it to clear himself. Aduwo, admitted to the allegations and confirmed the authenticity of the report of the preliminary panel before which he appeared.  The statement explained that: ‘‘Governing Council at its meeting approved the recommendations of the committee that Mr. Aduwo be dismissed from the services of the university with effect from 7th October, 2019.   “In a similar development, the Governing Council approved the dismissal of Mr. Temitope Olusegun Cephas Faleye and Dr. Adebanji Kayode Adegoke, with effect from 7th June, 2019 and 11th July, 2019 respectively for abandoning their duty posts”  The Vice Chancellor, Professor Edward Olanipekun, stressed that, “the university would not tolerate any act of misconduct and that the university would continue to flush out bad eggs in the system.”
