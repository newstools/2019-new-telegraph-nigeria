    Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom Wednesday said he has approved immediate promotion of school principals across the 23 local government areas of the state from grade levels 15 to 16. The gesture, the governor said is a mark of appreciation for the hard work exhibited by the principals as part of their contributions to the educational development of the state. The governor disclosed this through the Commissioner for Education, Prof. Dennis Ityavyar in an interview shortly after a meeting with school principals in Makurdi. “The government has decided to promote teachers to higher grades because they have been working so well and are on Grade level 15. So Governor Ortom has approved that they can go up to grade level 16. “Already their letters of promotion are being processed and will be brought to the Ministry of Education for approval so that very senior principals will be on grade level 16. “This is a mark of our appreciation for their contribution to the development of the educational sector,” he said. Governor Ortom said his administration will not compromise on closure of substandard schools in the state, noting that since he came on board, at least 2001 of such schools have so been closed down.
