The House of Representatives, yesterday, directed its committee on insurance and actuarial matters to undertake a forensic audit of insurance premium paid by ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs). The directive was consequent upon the adoption of a motion sponsored by the minority whip, Hon. Gideon Gwani (PDP, Kaduna) on the “need to investigate alleged breaches, impunity and other infractions by some Federal Government institutions on insurance and actuarial matters and the need to ensure probity.” In adopting the motion, the House mandated the committee to hold an investigative hearing involving all relevant stakeholders in the insurance industry to ascertain the veracity of claims that there are infractions by both MDAs and other institutions in the industry. Consequently, the House directed the MDAs to suspend all 2020 insurance renewal processes until there is a satisfactory resolution of all suspected infractions in their payment of premium. While presenting the motion, Gwani said there are allegations of infractions involving MDAs and insurance companies in the payment of insurance premium by government. He further stated that “several billions of naira are suspected to be paid as premium annually on either non-existent assets or on unverifiable data with unadjusted premium in breach of Section 61 of Insurance Act 2003 by some Federal Government institutions, which include, but not limited to; Office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation, National Youth Service Corp, some security agencies in collaboration with insurance companies that do not pay claims:” The motion was passed without opposing at the session presided over by Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila.
