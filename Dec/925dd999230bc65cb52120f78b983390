Gunmen have kidnapped the Cross River State Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Ben Ukpebi, from his residence. The incident occurred at CROSPIL Estate, Akpabuyo Local Government Area between 7.30a.m. and 8p.m. on Tuesday. A man close to the Ukpebi said the chairman was outside “taking fresh air and decided to go in” when the kidnappers stormed his residence. He said: “When he went inside the house, he got a call and because of the noise inside, he decided to go outside to take the call; that was when his abductors struck. “For some minutes, we waited for him to enter the house. He did not.  We went to check on him, low and behold, he was nowhere to be found. That was when we realised what had happened. “We saw his slippers and glasses on the ground without any trace of him.  His abductors also took his phone.  His family members have been calling his line, but it has been switched off since last night (Tuesday). And his abductors have not called up till now.” The state Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Irene Ugbo, confirmed the kidnap. She said: “The incident happened last night (Tuesday) but we have spread our dragnets and hope to locate them soon.  They took him along Akpabuyo area.”
