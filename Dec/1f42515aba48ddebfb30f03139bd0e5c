The Kano State House of Assembly has despite the recent court judgement sacking the four newly created Emirate Councils, gone ahead to pass the bill creating them. The Speaker of the House Alhaji Abdulaziz Garba Gafasa announced the Assembly’s approval of the four New Emirate/ Emirs into law on Thursday. The new bill, scaled through first, second and third readings before it was finally adopted by members of the assembly, approved the four additional Emirates Councils in the state including Bichi, Gaya, Rani and Karaye. Our Correspondent recalls that a Kano High Court presided by Justice Usman Na’Abba on November 21 had nullified the establishment of the four Emirates created in May 2019 saying the State House of Assembly did not follow due process in creating them. Justice Na’Abba pointed out that the Kano State House of Assembly violated section 101 of the Nigerian Constitution, which gives the Assembly the power to enact its rules and guidelines of proceedings. The bill is expected to be ascent to by Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje soon for immediate action.
