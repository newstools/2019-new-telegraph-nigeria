Nigeria Football Federation President Amaju Pinnick has criticized Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr for publicly demanding for his salary. The football administrator denied that the Nigerian Federation is owing the Franco-German despite claims he is being owed salary for three months. Rohr’s public request has led to the Nigerian Federation issuing him a query over his utterances. Pinnick said : ”We don’t owe you, you cannot come out to say that we are owning you salary. We pay you, an employee, and you must respect the employer because we pay you salary religiously. ”If they pay you, you don’t come out to say they pay you. There are some things you don’t say.” Rohr has a contract with the Nigeria Football Federation until June 2020 and can begin discussing with interested clubs or countries next month if his contract is not extended. The former Bayern Munich defender reportedly earns approximately $50,000 every month as coach of the Super Eagles.
