Wife of the Lagos State Governor, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo- Olu, has tasked children to contribute their quotas in the implementation of the developmental agenda of the current administration, saying that the agenda was specially designed to engender a greater Lagos. Speaking at the event which held at the Parliament, State House, Marina, the First Lady said it was important for children to know history of Nigeria, as well as the THEMES agenda of the State Government designed to engender a greater Lagos. She said: “As children, we want you to know what THEMES stands for and it has to do with so many things including Traffic Management. “You know when you are going to school in the morning and there is a lot of traffic, some of you get late to school and serve punishment because of the traffic. So, we must learn how to solve our traffic problem and it starts with all of us. On transportation too, we need buses, cars, trains, boats and trams to take us to school. We also have the health sector. “Each and every one of us at one time or the other have had to go to the hospital for check-up to ensure that we are okay; to ensure that we can see very well in school and then we can speak very well too. Even, our special needs children that need to go to special needs school to be taught in a special way.” She explained that the she decided to carry the children along in the THEMES agenda in order to make them become part of the history of taking Lagos to a greater height. “You see, way back we had the whites that were ruling Nigeria then; we had people like Lord Lugard if you have done history you would have heard that name. “They used to live here and take decisions for the whole of Nigeria not just Lagos. So, we want you to be part of the history too; we want you to know your history very well and at the same time we want you to enjoy your party,” Sanwo-Olu said.
