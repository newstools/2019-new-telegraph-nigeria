Ebonyi State Government, yesterday said it would begin payment of new minimum wage in January next year. Governor Dave Umahi stated this while signing the 2020 appropriation bill of N178bn into law.  The budget was presented to the House of Assembly on December 13 and was passed during the week. Umahi, however, said his administration will not be able to pay the new minimum wage incremental arrears to the workers due to paucity of funds. He said: “We attach much importance to our workers, from January 1, 2020, we will commence the payment of the minimum wage to our workers.  “We will increase our revenue base with a view of paying our minimum wage, we ask labour not to worry but, January 1 2020, we will commence payment of the minimum wage.”  He decried refusal of some highly placed persons in the state to pay taxes to boost the state Internally Generated Revenue (IGR).  He charged the state Internal Revenue Board to be aggressive in getting IGR for the state as according to him, there should be no sacred cow. He expressed dismay that some influential persons in the state have refused to pay taxes in the state.  “There will be no sacred cow in this state in getting IGR. You pay in Abuja, pay in Lagos, pay in Enugu but when you come to Ebonyi, you will not pay. There will not be anything like that. I am ready to quarrel with anybody and Internal Revenue Board should use whatever that is of my interest and set example.”
