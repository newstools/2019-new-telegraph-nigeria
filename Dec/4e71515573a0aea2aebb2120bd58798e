The Lagos State Police Command has arrested two men in connection with murder of Mrs. Gildas Tohouo, a Hungarian citizen, whose husband is a shipping magnet. The deceased’s husband, a Cameroonian, is said to be the Managing Director of Maersk Shipping Company. Gildas was alleged to have been attacked in Lagos with a knife and later died. It was further gathered that her husband was also attacked and presently battling to stay alive in an undisclosed hospital. The incident occurred on Sunday at about 11p.m. at their Lugard, Ikoyi residence after a birthday party for one of their children. It was learnt that a few hours after the party, their power supply suddenly went off.  Their estate electrician, Ade Akanbi, later came to their gate to knock, insisting that he came to fix the fused in the couple’s apartment, which he claimed caused the power outage. The electrician, who came with a friend, Olamide Goke, allegedly used the opportunity of the power outage to attack the couple. Gildas was stabbed to death, while her husband, is in a hospital, battling to stay alive. According to a police source, Akanbi told police that he attacked the couple because he had earlier asked the couple for an assistance, which the husband allegedly refused to give. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Bala Elkana, said that the state’s Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, swiftly moved to the scene of the incident where the house was cordoned off. The CP, however, ordered Homicide Detectives from the State Criminal Investigations and Intelligence Department (SCIID) to the scene. It was gathered that based on the directives of the CP, the police launched an earnest investigation and zeroed in on the two suspects. Elkana further said: “The two suspects arrested are assisting the police in the on-going investigation.”
