...asks AGF to approach Dubai for nevessary action  The Police in Dubai may not be bound by orders made by Nigerian courts bordering on a former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Mohammed Adoke (SAN). There were reports that the former AGF was arrested by the International Police Organisation (INTERPOL) in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had, sometime in 2016, filed a criminal charge against Adoke before the federal high court in Abuja, over the Oil Prospective Licence (OPL) 245 settlement deal, otherwise known as Malabu scandal. Prior to the said arrest in Dubai, the EFCC had obtained an order of court for Adokeâ€™s arrest, even as another court was said to have made a counter order restraining the commission from taking him in.  But Chairman, Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC), Prof. Itse Sagay, has said that none of such orders had effect on Dubai, or the Police there.  The professor of international law, who spoke with New Telegraph against the backdrop of the arrest, however, enjoined the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation (OAGF), to file an action before a competent court in Dubai, to restrain Adoke pending possible extradition.
