Flights have been cancelled after a private plane came off the runway at Liverpool John Lennon Airport. The airport is expected to be closed until 17:00 GMT and an inquiry has been launched into what happened when the plane landed at about 06:00. Four people were on board the plane but no-one was hurt, a spokesman for the airport has confirmed. A source at Liverpool Football Club confirmed the private jet was carrying one of the club’s owners, Mike Gordon, reports the BBC. Gordon, who is the president of Fenway Sports Group, was on a flight from Bedford, Massachusetts to Liverpool to attend a regular meeting at the club. “He was not injured but would like to pass on his appreciation to the staff at Liverpool John Lennon Airport and the emergency services for their amazing work,” the source said. A  spokeswoman for VistaJet added: “We are fully co-operating with the airport and relevant authorities as they investigate further.” A specialist removal team is on site and will use cranes and airbags to remove the plane from the grass. The plane could not be removed until officials from the Air Accident Investigation Board deem it safe to do so, the BBC understands. Passengers due to fly this morning have been advised to contact their airlines for further information. Some travellers reported four-hour delays while others have had their flights diverted to Manchester Airport. Eric Henderson, from Preston, was due to travel to Amsterdam for work. “Our flight was due to leave at 07:30. We noticed at ten to that the flight had been moved to 11:40,” he said. “There was no explanation until we looked out of the large windows on the concourse and saw all the blue flashing lights.”
