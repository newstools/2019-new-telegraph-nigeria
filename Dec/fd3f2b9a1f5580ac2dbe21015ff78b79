Dangote Cement Plc has said it will be seeking the approval of shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting on January 22, 2020, to repurchase about 10 per cent of its issued share capital, using part of the company’s profit in a bid to enhance returns on investment to its shareholders. In a regulatory filing with the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), the company said it intended to undergo a share buyback programme in respect of 10 per cent of its issued shares, which is in line with the company’s corporate strategy. The company in an explanatory note said: “Pursuant to Section 160(2)(e) of the Companies and Allied Matters Act, Cap C20, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004 (CAMA) and Rule 398 of the Securities and Exchange Commission Consolidated Rules and Regulations, 2013 (as amended), the company intends to undergo a share buy-back programme in respect of 10 per cent of its issued shares, which is in line with the company’s corporate strategy to, inter alia, improve the Company’s Return on Equity (RoE) and shareholder value in order to facilitate future long term growth. “The relevant shares will be repurchased out of the profits of the company and any such number of shares bought under the programme is required to be cancelled in accordance with the SEC Rules and the Nigerian Stock Exchange Rulebook 2015, which will consequently lead to a reduction in issued share capital. “However, Section 160(1) of CAMA provides that the articles of association of a company must authorise any share buy-back programme to be undertaken by the company. Furthermore, the articles of association also need to authorise any reduction of the share capital of a company, as provided under Section 106 of CAMA. It is based on the foregoing that the company requests its shareholders to consider the alteration of the Articles, as well as the Programme. “The resolution will be passed as a special resolution pursuant to the provisions of sections 48 and 106 CAMA as well as Rule 398(3)(iv) of the SEC Rules. It is in light of the above that the company has convened an EGM to consider, and if thought fit, approve the alteration of the Articles, the Programme and all matters incidental thereto.
