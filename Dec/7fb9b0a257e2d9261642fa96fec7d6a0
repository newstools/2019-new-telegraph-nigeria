  As part of the measures to completely restore sanity on Apapa axis, the Lagos State government Friday announced plans to close the Mile 2-Tincan Island road to traffic for 72 hours. With the move, New Telegraph learnt that the palliative measure would enhance free flow of traffic on the axis, while the ongoing restoration of law and order by the Presidential Task Force would be remarkably improved when the road is completed. The Commissioner for Transportation Dr Fredric Oladeinde, who disclosed this, said the closure would commence on Monday and would allow the Federal Government to carry out palliative work on the bad portion on that axis without any hindrance. The commissioner directed that effective from Sunday midnight, all vehicles and trucks carrying exports and empty containers for Tin Can Port Operations are to stay out of that corridor for the next three days that the palliative works will last. He explained that fuel laden-tankers and other cars on essential services are exempt from the directive.
