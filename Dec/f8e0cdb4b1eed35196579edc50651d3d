Ngozi Okobi has signed a new two-year contract extension with Eskilstuna United, keeping her at the Swedish Damallsvenskan outfit until the winter of 2021. The Nigeria international joined the Swedish top-flight side from Asarum in 2018 on a one-year deal from rivals Vittsjo with an option of an extension, which expired this November. To secure her new contract extension, the midfielder scored a goal and made several assists in 22 outings to inspire Magnus Karlsson’s side to a fourth-place finish in the 2019 season. Okobi’s decision to stay put at Eskilstuna until November 2021 means she will continue to enjoy the company of her compatriot Halimatu Ayinde, who penned a three-year extension last month. Having ended two places adrift of a Champions League spot, Karlsson extolled the impact of the Nigerian and is pleased to keep her for two more seasons. “We have now secured Sonia for the coming years. Individually and offensively, they may be United’s top-tier players and internationally top-notch,” Karlsson told the club website. “During the 2019 season, Soina also showed that she mastered the defensive game and contributes collectively. “There is still potential for development. I am grateful and happy to continue to work with a great personality”.
