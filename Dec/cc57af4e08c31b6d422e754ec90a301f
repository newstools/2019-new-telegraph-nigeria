A non-governmental Organisation, the Education Rights Campaign (ERC), has described  the ongoing controversy generated by the implementation of the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) in the public universities as unnecessary and diversionary. This is as the group expressed disbelief that the IPPIS was capable of curbing corruption and ensuring sanity, transparency and accountability in the public education system, as well as the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) where the policy had already been introduced. According to the National Coordinator and National Secretary, Hassan Taiwo Soweto and Omole Ibukun respectively, the ERC noted that only democratic management of public schools by elected representatives of workers, students, parents and communities could curb corruption in the education system, and ensure that every kobo voted into the institutions actually reflects in thr progress of the sector. In a statement, entitled: “Implementation of IPPIS, without democratic control and management of school, will not curb corruption in public universities” Hassan, however, insisted that the governing councils of universities and boards of other education institutions should be reconstituted in order to ensure that the workers and students, have a say on how the resources of the institutions are spent. “In the same vein, the Vice-Chancellors, Rectors and Provosts as well as other principal officers of the institutions are to be elected from the academic community, and not to be appointed by the Visitor or Moderator to the institutions as it is the case presently,” they added. According to the organisation, this will go a long way in ensuring that the financial and political powers of the university community are well democratised and reside with the members of that community, thus making them directly responsible for their welfare and therefore curbing corruption. The statement added: “Considering the enormous challenges of underfunding, high tuition fees and clampdown facing the education sector, no doubt, mindboggling corruption has become the hallmark of many public tertiary institutions in Nigeria. In fact, if comprehensive and diligent investigations are carried out into the activities of universities and other educational institutions, many Vice-Chancellors, Rectors and Provosts alongside with other principal officers as well as accounting officers and members of the Governing Councils would be culpable of financial malfeasance. “On the basis of the foregoing, we demand that the Federal Government should not throw the education system into another needless crisis by going ahead to stop the salary of university lecturers, who are opposed to the IPPIS, as such  step would provoke strike which would lead to another shutdown of the university system.” However, the ERC urged the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) to deepen its argument beyond the question of defending the university autonomy or the so-called uniqueness of the university environment, but to boldly demand democratic control and management of the institutions as the only effective way to ensure that any measure aimed at curbing corruption in the university system could work. They also pointed out that there could be no trust in the institutions’ Governing Councils, as presently constituted with majority of their members being political appointees of the government, to fight corruption in the university system, where visitation panels had been said to be compromised in their recommendations in support of some corrupt administrations in the universities.
