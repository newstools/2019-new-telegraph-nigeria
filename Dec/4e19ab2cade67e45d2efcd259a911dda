*Incompetent people running Ogun, says Adebutu Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has said he would unveil the list of his commissioners before Christmas. Abiodun, who disclosed this at a luncheon organised for critical stakeholders in Abeokuta on Tuesday evening, said criticisms will not deter his administration from realizing its set goals. “Between now and Christmas, all those speculations (about who made the list or didn’t) will be put to rest,” the governor declared to the admiration of notable chieftains of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state who were among his audience. This disclosure came as a former House of Representatives member and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain, Oladipupo Adebutu, took a swipe at the governor over his failure to constitute cabinet six months after assuming office. Adebutu, who spoke in Abeokuta on Wednesday, described the situation in the state as “zero governance,” adding that incompetent people were currently at the helm of affairs. He said: “Six months since May 29, we are yet to have a properly constituted government. Part of government is to have other aspects such as commissioners and so on. “We don’t have total government in Ogun State today because of people for selfish reasons that came, pleading and begging because of ambition, they must win Ogun State by all means. “When we resisted, the reply was to subvert the system and give us incompetent people to look forward to as leaders.” However, before Adebutu fired his salvo, the governor had on Tuesday said the long-awaited list of commissioners, special advisers, board members and members of statutory bodies in the state would be released before Christmas.
