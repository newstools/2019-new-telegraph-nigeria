     Ownership of the land bordering the Civil Service Clinic in Ilorin has officially reverted to Kwara State Government, according to a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, adding that a new secretariat complex will now be erected on the land next year. The statement said the land was originally meant for Government Secretariat and parking space of the Civil Service Clinic but was unlawfully allocated to a private firm Asa Investments Limited without any record of payment to the state government, adding that no certificate of occupancy was ever issued in favour of the firm. Government itself had bought the land to house the civil service clinic, its parking space, and a secretariat. The statement said the government has now made provisions for the secretariat in the 2020 budget, although, it said, its construction will spill over to 2021. “Hundreds of civil servants still operate from rented apartments at a huge cost to the government. The new secretariat, once completed in 2021, will definitely go a long way to end this unhealthy trend as well as provide a more conducive and decent working environment for government workers,” the statement added. Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has signed a constitutional instrument withdrawing the allocation of plots of land 1, 3 and 5 to the firm, asserting that the said land was unlawfully appropriated contrary to the purpose for which it was meant. The governor’s decision followed a resolution of the State House of Assembly urging him to reclaim the land because it was arbitrarily taken over in the 1990s without any evidence of payment by the Asa Investment Limited, even though the land was meant for public use.
