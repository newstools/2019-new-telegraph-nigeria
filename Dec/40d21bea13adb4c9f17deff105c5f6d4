Special Adviser to the Governor on Works and Infrastructure, Aramide Adeyoye, who disclosed this after the open biding held at the Bagauda Kaltho Press Centre, Alausa, said that the opening of the bid was the first of the six stages before a winner would be selected to construct the Fourth Mainland Bridge, describing the process as very transparent.
