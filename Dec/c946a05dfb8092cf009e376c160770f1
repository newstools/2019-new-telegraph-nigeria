 A s the management of the Federal School of Surveying, Oyo, prepares for mass convocation of its graduates in the past ten years, the Rector of the professional institution, Surveyor (Dr.) Dupe Olayinka, has said that the school was not opposed to the Federal Government’s policy of Integrated Personnel Payroll and Information System (IPPIS) unlike the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) but said that there were a series of anomalies in the system.  The Rector of the 111-year-old institution who spoke with journalists at the school during the 20th convocation press conference, disclosed that staff of the school had been captured twice in 2016, but in the recent capturing initiated by the Accountant-General of the Federation, 37 of the school’s staff were missing in the list released, while names of three staff already deceased surfaced on the list, and one staff that had voluntarily retired also had his name on the list. Due to the anomalies, the first female Rector and indigene of Oyo town lamented that staff’s November salary was yet to be paid.  Olayinka said: “It is better we are getting our salaries from the centre. If it is going to check corruption, there is no institution that would say no.  “The fear of ASUU and other unions is because some that have been captured have issues. After the exercise had been done in this institution, names of no fewer than 37 of our staff were missing from the list. “Three staff who were deceased were surprisingly on the list, and one staff that had voluntarily retired had his name still on the list. This is confusing.”
