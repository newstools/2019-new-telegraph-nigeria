At least, 30 shops were razed and goods worth millions of naira destroyed as fire gulled Owode Onirin Market at the Ikorodu area of Lagos State yesterday.  The Director-General of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), said that no life was lost in the fire, adding that 30 shops and goods were burnt.   It was gathered that the fire started from the metal section of the market.   Osanyintolu said: “The fire emanated from one of the shops within the market. The cause of the fire is unknown as there was no power supply within the market. No life was lost, but valuables were destroyed. The fire has been curtailed with the combined efforts of LASEMA and fire fighters.”   Osanyintolu said that the cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained. He explained that there had been no power supply in the market since 2017.
