The Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi, has stated that he is greater than the duo of Sango and Ogun, two deities worshipped by the Yoruba. Though he said he respected the deities for the role they played during their eras and proud to call himself their son, he stressed that education and exposure to other societies had elevated him beyond the accomplishments of the deities.  He said, “civilisation has overtaken their eras to the extent that a son of slave now has no reason to make it in life.  History needs to be only referenced; I must be greater; you must be greater than your fathers. You must be greater than your ancestors.” The Oluwo maintained that greatness should not stop during the age of forefathers, declaring that if he is not greater than his fathers, it is a sad end to the fathers.
