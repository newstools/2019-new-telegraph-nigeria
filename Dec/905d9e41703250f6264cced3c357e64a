A court in the Philippines has found members of the Ampatuan family guilty in the murder of 57 people – including 32 journalists – in a massacre carried out a decade ago on the southern island of Mindanao. Three generations of the influential family were among scores of people on trial in a case seen as a crucial test of impunity in a country where provincial power is often decided by corruption, intimidation and violence. The brazen attack was the country’s single worst case of election violence, reports al-Jazeera. The defendants denied charges of multiple counts of murder and face up to 30 years in jail for each one. “We are rooting for a conviction no more, no less,” Nena Santos, a private prosecutor in the case, told reporters ahead of the verdict. “This is very important because if no conviction here it would mean the impunity continues, press freedom is dead and the democratic process is at stake.” There were 357 witnesses and 197 suspects, 80 of them still at large.
