A group under the auspices of Concerned Youths of Niger Delta (CYND) has threatened to attack Igbo interests in River State, following the weekend attack on Minister of Transportation, Chief Chibuike Amaechi, by Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in Madrid, Spain.  Worried by the development, which they de- scribed as a ‘national embarrassment,’ the youth group drawn from the six Niger Delta states of Rivers, Bayelsa, Akwa Ibom, Delta, Cross River and Edo, threatened to destroy Igbo properties, especially in Rivers State.  The group’s National Coordinator, Chikaru Oronda Ndamati, who read the communiqué after their emergency meeting held in Uyo, Akwa Ibon State, warned IPOB against venting their anger on Amaechi and other national leaders over their personal grievances and gave them seven days to apologise to the minister.  According to Ndamati; “IPOB should remember that all Igbo in South-South have and do businesses in Rivers State, particularly in Ikwere land, which happens to be Rt. Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi’s ethnic nationality. “We are going to destroy all Igbo properties in Ikwerre land and Niger Delta, should they fail to tender an unreserved apology to Amaechi and Ikwerre ethnic nationality, within seven days.  “Having accepted the responsibility of the attack on Amaechi in Spain, IPOB should also be ready to take full responsibility for any reaction that will come out from their dastardly act,” he said.   Other youth leaders in attendance at the briefing include state coordinators, Effiong Abang (Akwa Ibom); Ubong Stephens (Cross River); Mike Gibson Saware (Bayelsa); Clement Jack Okarevu (Delta and Jude Nosa Momoh (Edo). The group urged the Federal Government to take the matter before the international community to compel world leaders to always beef up security around Nigerian leaders on foreign trips. They also called on the FG to prevail on Spanish suthorities to extradite those arrested for such security breach in Spain for trial in Nigeria.
