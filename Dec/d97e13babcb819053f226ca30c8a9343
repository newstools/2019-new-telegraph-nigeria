Four passengers were killed and several others injured in a multiple auto crash involving a truck and a luxury bus along the Agbor-Asaba-Onitsha Expressway. The ill-fated bus was negotiating a U-turn at the popular Emuhu Junction in Agbor, Ika South Local Government Area of Delta State, before it ram into the truck, which compressed a section of the bus, killing people. The survivors were immediately rushed to the Emergency Unit of the Agbor Central Hospital where they were placed on life-support gadgets. An eyewitness, who simply identified herself as Madam Chinwe, blamed the truck driver for not applying his brake immediately he sighted the bus from afar. She said: “Truck drivers are too daring. They hardly step on their brakes for smaller vehicles. In this circumstance, lives would have been saved if the truck driver had applied caution. Two wrongs cannot make a right. He did not take to precautions.” The Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps in the state, Mr Ahmad Ocheja, who confirmed the accident, said it was a multiple accident, involving a luxury bus, a truck and other vehicles. He added that the impact was much on the bus.
