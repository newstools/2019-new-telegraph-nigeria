The organised labour in Ogun State has directed workers in the civil and public services to proceed on a two-day warning strike over the state government’s failure to implement the new national minimum wage.
It said this became inevitable in view of the decision of the Governor Dapo Abiodun-led administration to deliberately ignore its correspondences and calls for the constitution of a negotiation committee on the minimum wage.
The directive on strike was contained in a communiqué issued at the end of an emergency meeting of the organised labour held in Abeokuta on Monday.
The communiqué was jointly signed by the state chairman of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Emmanuel Bankole; chairman, Trade Union Congress (TUC), Comrade Olubunmi Fajobi; chairman of the Joint Negotiating Council (JNC), Olanrewaju Folorunso; and the Coordinating Secretary, Olusegun Adebiyi.
New Telegraph reports that the impending warning strike will hold on Thursday and Friday..
