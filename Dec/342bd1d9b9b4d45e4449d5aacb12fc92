Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCCC), Ibadan zonal office, Wednesday stormed a Lagos hotel believed to be a hideout for Internet fraudsters, and arrested a Yahoo kingpin, as well as 26 others. The target of the operation was one Rasaq Balogun, a suspected Internet fraud kingpin, whose illicit activities dominated intelligence gathered from the recently arrested ‘police spies’ during a raid on their Abeokuta base. According to findings, Balogun harbours an army of young men recruited to carry out financial fraud through the use of the Internet. Some others were also arrested at his Beckley Estate residence, also in Lagos State. The raid on his hotel, Modzak Hotel, at Abule-Egba, Lagos State, sufficiently gave credence to the suspicion as a retinue of young men were caught lodging in his hotel with no specific mission. The suspected kingpin and 26 other young men ranging between the ages of 18 and 35 years were arrested at the scene. Some others were also arrested and brought to the Commission’s Ibadan zonal office for further interrogation. According to the report, officers of the anti-graft agency also recovered three vehicles, fetish items, laptops, mobile phones and documents suspected to contain fraudulent data from the suspect, while promising that the indicted will be charged to court as soon as investigations were concluded.
