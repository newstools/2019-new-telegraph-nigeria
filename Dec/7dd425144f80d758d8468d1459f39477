The House of Representatives on Wednesday expressed concern at the rising cases of the influx of fake and substandard drugs into the country from the ports and borders.
The lower chamber subsequently resolved to investigate the development with a view to nipping it in the bud.
While presenting the motion at Wednesdayâ€™s plenary, the sponsor, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu lamented that many Nigerians are dying from kidney and heart-related disease as a result of the use of such substandard drugs.
He pointed out that the relevant agencies such as National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), who should affect the duties of checking the inflow of such drugs, had been expelled from ports and borders since 2011 by the then minister of finance.
The minority leader noted that the reasons for expelling NAFDAC and SON no longer exists as goods are now cleared electronically, he wondered why the agencies have not been cleared to resume duties at the ports and borders as no other agency has the mandate, capacity and know-how to effectively check the influx and circulation of substandard drugs.
