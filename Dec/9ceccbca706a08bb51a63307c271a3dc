   The South West zone of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Wednesday, asked the National Assembly to urgently revisit the electoral bill which was “curiously” vetoed by President Muhammadu Buhari.
The party said the bill represents an immediate panacea to the growing malpractices and irregularities rocking the nation’s electoral process.
Rising from a stakeholders meeting held in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, the PDP leaders bemoaned the alleged surreptitious plot by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to subvert the mandate of Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State.
The party leaders also condemned the alleged use of security agencies to compromise election results in favour of APC in the recent gubernatorial elections in Kogi and Bayelsa States.
In attendance at the meeting were Governor Makinde, who was represented by his Chief of Staff, Chief Bisi Ilaka; former Minister of Aviation, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, former presidential spokesman, Dr Doyin Okupe, former House of Representatives member, Oladipupo Adebutu, and former Nigerian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Ibrahim Kazaure.
Others include the PDP Deputy National Chairman (South), Elder Yemi Akinwonmi, PDP National Secretary, Ibrahim Tsuari, National Vice Chairman (South West), Dr Eddy Olafeso, and Lagos State chairman of PDP, Chief Deji Doherty.
Some of the PDP leaders took turns to express concern over the political situation in the country, saying it was degenerating under Buhari’s watch.
The party chieftains observed a minute silence for the late PDP Women Leader in Kogi, Mrs Salome Acheju Abuh, who was burnt to death recently.
In a communiqué issued after the meeting, the South West PDP renewed calls for urgent review of the electoral process towards sanitizing it to command respect.
It will be recalled that the 8th Assembly under the immediate past Senate President Bukola Saraki proposed an Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill but it was not assented to by the President.
