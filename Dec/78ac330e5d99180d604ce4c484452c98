 T he Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Niger State has lambasted Governor Abubakar Sani Bello led All Progressives Congress (APC) for the series of bandits’ attacks on the state, saying that; “the party has plunged the state into a ‘Guantanamo status,’ where people live in terror.”  The state chapter of the PDP in its Christmas and New Year message to the people, took a swipe at the ruling APC in the state for what it termed widespread poverty, insecurity and economic debauchery.   In a statement signed by its Chairman in the state, Tanko Beji and made available to journalists in Minna, the PDP blamed the governor for his inept attitude to governance and Senator Sani Musa for sponsoring a social media strangulation bill instead of an emergency, quick response and support to victims’ bill.   According to Beji, “The state security architecture is almost broken down as 10 out of the 15 wards in Shiroro Local Government Area are under bandits’ attacks with several people killed. APC’s arrogance has pushed the state to a ‘Guantanamo status. From that region came an APC senator who is sponsoring social media strangulation bill instead of emergency and quick response and support to victims’ bill. Where is the governor who swore to protect and defend the people? Paris? London? or New York? certainly not Minna!”
