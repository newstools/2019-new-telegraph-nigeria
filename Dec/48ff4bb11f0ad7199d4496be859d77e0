Police Special Forces have interceptesd 4000 packs of tramadol worth N54 million, at a location in Bauchi State. The controlled pain killer drugs were being couried to Potiskum in Yobe State by suspects, who were arrested by the operatives during mop-up operations. The Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO), DCP Frank Mba, made the disclosure on Tuesday in Abuja, at the presentation of 71 criminal suspects at the headquarters of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). Mba said the nationwide operation that led to the arrests of the suspects, were aimed at ensuring a crime-free Christmas and New Year celebrations. He, however, explained that, the estimated amount was given to  him by somebody. “Somebody gave us an estimate of N54 million, but I don’t deal on drugs,” Mba said. Apart from the arrest in Bauchi, operatives also rounded-up “one chance” syndicate, 2-man gang of burglars, as well as suspected automated teller machine (ATM) cards’ thieves, in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory.
