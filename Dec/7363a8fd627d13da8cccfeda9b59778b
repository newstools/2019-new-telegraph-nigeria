The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has denied any interference in the election of the party’s leadership in Lagos State.
The party said the statement credited to its former Deputy National Chairman, Chief Bode George of interference of the National Working Committee (NWC) was erroneous.
George had in a publication on Monday, accused the Prince Uche Secondus-led national leadership of the party of impunity, and said the NWC conducted an election into the Lagos State chapter despite subsisting court order.
“What they are doing is illogical and illegal, totally out of the constitution. If they cannot follow the rule as stated in the constitution, they are going to kill the party very fast,” George was quoted in that publication.
But PDP said Monday that the emergence of Adedeji Doherty-led executive committee followed all due processes as stipulated by the party’s constitution and guidelines as well as the Electoral Act.
The party in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan also stated that  all actions taken by its members in Lagos State in filling vacancies left either by resignations, defections and or death of occupants of those offices followed due process.
