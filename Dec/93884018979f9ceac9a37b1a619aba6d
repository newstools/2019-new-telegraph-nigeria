Lagos State government said that it recorded 2,506 child abuse cases from January to November 2019, just as it renewed its war against use of children for alms begging. The Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Mr. Olusegun Daodu, disclosed this while briefing journalists on the sensitisation on ending violence against children. Daodu warned that henceforth government would begin massive arrest and prosecution of parents, guardians and anyone who engaged children in illicit begging. The commissioner decried the growing rate of child abuse ranging from sexual, physical, emotional abuse and child labour. He said government would henceforth commence enforcement of the law to serve as deterrent to all child abusers. Daodu said that one of the key recommendations of the survey conducted by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and other global organisations on violence against children was to strengthen data collection on the children. The commissioner said that the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration was determined to tackle the problem of child abuse headlong. According to him, several machineries and structures geared towards implementation of the policies that will bring an end to all forms of abuse have been put in place. He said: “Despite the efforts, a sizeable number of our children still suffer significant harm. Hence, the need for continued sensitisation of the various stakeholders, parents, caregivers, religious leaders, family members, teachers, markets women/men, drivers’ unions and others who have contested with the children.
