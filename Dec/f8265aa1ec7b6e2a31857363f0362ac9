The African Development Bank (AfDB), the World Bank Group, the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the Islamic Development Bank (IDB),  have pledged to  step up their support for refugees and people affected by forced displacement, including hosting communities, across a wide range of sectors and policy instruments. “Forced displacement is not only a humanitarian issue, but also a developmental issue which calls for holistic, inclusive and durable solutions. This includes supporting our regional member countries in the prevention of forced displacement by addressing drivers of fragility and building resilience in Africa as well as significantly expanding livelihood opportunities in rural and urban areas,” said Yero Baldeh, Director of the Transition States Coordination Office at the African Development Bank (AfDB). He was speaking during the Global Refugee Forum, being held from 16 to 18 December in Geneva, Switzerland. “Fostering stronger strategic partnerships in this regard is absolutely crucial, which was also highlighted by President Adesina during the Aswan Forum for Sustainable Peace and Development last week,” Baldeh said. More than 70 million people are forcibly displaced globally, with African countries hosting about 8 million refugees and 16 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs).
