The Zonal Commanding Officer of RS 10 HQ Sokoto, Assistant Corps Marshal Kayode Olagunju, has advised drivers against using expired tyres, speeding and overloading during the Yuletide celebration. Olagunju gave this advice yesterday at the launch of 2019 Ember months Road Safety Campaign held at the centre garage in Birnin Kebbi, adding that there is need for drivers to go for eye tests regularly. He then urged the stakeholders in the state to work together in order to reduce road crashes as road crashes kill more passengers than drivers. In his remark, the State Sector Commander, Mr. EA Asaniyan, said that drivers should avoid the use of drugs and that they should not also drive when they are tired. He also said that the use of seatbelt and adherence to all traffic laws are very important even as he warned against overloading among other infractions. Asaniyan thanked the Kebbi State government for always being there for them in terms of advocacy and other needs.
