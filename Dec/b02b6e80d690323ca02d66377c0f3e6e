Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) Thursday alleged that the Federal Government insisted on its members and other non-teaching staff enrolling in the Integrated Personnel Payroll and Information System (IPPIS) because the contractor awarded the project was being paid N16,000 for each staff enrolled, amounting to N2billion for all targeted. According to the Chairman of ASUU, University of Ibadan branch, Professor Deji Omole, while speaking with journalists in Ibadan, the contractor will be paid that amount if all non-teaching and academic staff are fully enrolled by the end of this month targeted. While describing the government of President Muhammadu Buhari as government of “contractoracy” where public monies are given out to friends of government for the benefit of associates, ASUU frowned at the policy coming from a government claiming to be fighting corruption. Breaking down the analysis, Onole said that according to the National University Commission (NUC) data, 40 federal universities have a total of 119,202 staff (35,963 academic staff and 83,239 non-teaching staff), wondering where the IPPIS got the 39,000 academic staff it claimed to have enrolled.
