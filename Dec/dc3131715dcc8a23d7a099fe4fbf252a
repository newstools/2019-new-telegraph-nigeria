A member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Mufutau Egberongbe, has described Nigeria as a very fortunate country peopled with a population that believes in perseverance. Egberongbe, who represents Apapa Federal Constituency on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), said this level of perseverance has kept Nigeria united in spite of security threats and other challenges that had run for many years. The lawmaker made this position known in a message to Nigerians in commemoration of this year’s Christmas celebration. “We all agree, irrespective of individual and national challenges, that Nigeria is a great country. “Nigeria is not great because of its size, but because the about 200 citizens have decided in their thoughts and actions to strengthen the country,” the lawmaker said. While commending the citizens for their patience with the government, he assured them that the administration of President Muhammad Buhari will leave a lasting legacy, the foundation of which is already being laid. “In the spirit of the season, I plead with Nigerians, especially Christians, to continue to pray for the country, themselves and the government. “The virtues of Jesus the Christ cannot be over-emphasised at this period. He is the reason for this season and the least we can do is to obey His instructions of being our brother’s keepers beyond the celebration. “Jesus preached the act of giving. We should learn to reach out to the poor and put smiles on the faces of the needy and less privileged at all times too,” he said. He further promised to continue to meet the expectations of his constituents as well as play roles for the growth and progress of Lagos state and Nigeria.
