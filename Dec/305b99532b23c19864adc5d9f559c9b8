A young man of about 30 years escaped death by the whiskers in Onitsha yesterday when he was discovered to be an Army officer impersonator by the people. The fake army officer, whose name was not disclosed, according to residents of 59, Old Market Road, claimed he is a military officer when he charged into the compound with other fierce looking young boys between the ages of 25 and 30 about 8am in the morning. Accordingly to one of the residents, who did not want his name in print, trouble started when the fake military man and his accomplices demanded the payment of certain sum of money owed one of them by one of the tenants living in the compound. But on getting to the tenantâ€™s apartment, they discovered that he was not at home. They then attempted to take away the young girl they met in his apartment, but the girl raised the alarm, as they were dragging her along with them, with her phone and other valuables seized from her by the men. The alarm attracted the attention of other tenants, mostly young men, numbering about 30. When they demanded for the identity of the military officer, he could not produce any evidence to show he is a military officer and suspecting foul play, they descended on him, almost lynching him, as they battered him with logs of woods, bottles and other dangerous weapons. All efforts to contact the police failed as all calls put across to the Onitsha Area Command were not answered.
