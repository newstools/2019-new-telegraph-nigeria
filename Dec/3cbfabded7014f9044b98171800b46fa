By Philip Nyam, Abuja The House of Representatives on Wednesday joined the Senate in increasing mobilisation fee of local contractors from 15 to 30 percent in what it believes will reduce the bureaucratic issues that delay the execution of projects by amending the procurement act. Recall that the Senate had last week passed the bill and transmitted to the House for concurrence. An executive bill, it is titled: “a bill for an act to amend the National Council on Public Procurement and the Bureau of Public Procurement act, No. 14, 2017 to review the mobilization fees paid to contractors, institute e-procurement and provide time frame for the procurement process etc and for related matters” Presenting the bill for concurrence, the acting leader of the House, Hon. Peter Akpatason said the current mobilisation fee for local contractors was inadequate and that it caused abandonment of contracts in the country. He said when passed into law, the bill will reduce the timeline for processing contracts award to two weeks, while it approved four days for issuance of certificates. The lawmakers, however, did not fix any percentage as mobilisation fee for foreign contractors.
