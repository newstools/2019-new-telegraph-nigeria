A hit-and-run driver on Monday reportedly killed a second-year nursing student, Emmanuel Aniagudo, of Iyienu Mission hospital, Anambra State.
The incident, which occurred in Ogidi in the Idemili North Local Government Area of the state, promptly triggered protest amongst students of the school.
An eyewitness said: “Aniagudo was crossing a road near the hospital when he was knocked down by the speeding car.
“The driver sped off, leaving the deceased in the pool of blood in a gutter.”
The protesting students carried placards, barricading the major road and making a bonfire with used tyres.
Some of the placards read, “Enough of these killings”, “we need check-points”, there should be bumps inside the hospital premises and on the major road where our colleague was hit”, “hospital management should compensate the family.”
Reacting, the Hospital Administrator, Rev. Tochukwu Okwuchukwu, described the incident as unfortunate, assuring them of the immediate installation of speed breakers on the road leading to the school.
“I’ve appealed to the students to calm down and to leave the major road leading to the hospital compound to avoid miscreants cashing in on the situation to cause more havoc.
“We will build the speed breakers on the hospital roads as they demanded. In fact, we are starting off immediately,” the administrator stated.
