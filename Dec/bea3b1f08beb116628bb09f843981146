Muritala Ayinla The Lagos State Attorney-General and Commissioner Justice, Mr Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN) has said that the state is currently handling over 3000 cases and has arrested over 200 persons in connection with land grabbing cases. According to him, since the enactment of the Lagos State Property Protection Law, 2016 and the establishment of the Special Taskforce on Land Grabbers, a total of 3600 petitions have been received by the taskforce on land grabbing. Speaking on the activities of the ministry, the Onigbanjo, who confirmed that the cases of land grabbing were still rampart in the state, said that efforts were being made to curtail their notorious activities. He added that about 500 of these petitions have been concluded. He said: “I make bold to say that the nefarious and notorious activities of Land Grabbers have been gradually curtailed in Lagos State. Yes, there are still pockets of reports of illegal activities of land grabbers across the State. We are not unaware of the havoc and unrest caused by these land grabbers particularly in developing areas of Ibeju-Lekki, Ajah, Ikorodu, Ipaja, Badagry amongst others but this, when compared to what obtains before the enactment of the property protection law and establishment of the taskforce has shown that the implementation of the law through the taskforce is yielding the desired results,” he said. Harping on the Office of the Public Defender OPD, he said that the agency has been able to handle 1,636 cases, 600 petitions out of which 245 have been concluded, 141 judgements obtained, over 30 children rescued and total compensation of N8,103,567.09 was received on behalf of clients. “Similarly PAC – Public Advisory Centre, received monetary claims of N3,684.666 on behalf of claimants whilst the Directorate of Citizen’s Rights instituted cases in the National Industrial Court where seven claimants were awarded N21, 352,319 as terminal benefits from their various organisations,” the AG said.
