A 38-year-old man, Yakubu Abubakar, has been arrested by the police in Niger State for shooting at his brother with a pistol.
Abubakar was arrested at Paiko village in the Paikoro  Local Government Area of the state after he was found with a fabricated locally made pistol.
It was learnt that Abubakar, a vigilante of Aninigi village, was trailed and apprehended by a team of policemen attached to Paikoro Division based on information received.
The suspect was said to have given his brother Yakubu Zakari, a magic ring believed to be a bullet proof that will protect him from gunshots in case of any eventualities.
It was reliably gathered that the suspect tested the power of the ring on the victim by firing twice without success but his third attempt hit the victim who was rushed to the IBB Specialist Hospital Minna for medical attention.
In an interview with our correspondent, the suspect said: “I am not a thief or a killer. I only fire the gun to test the power of the magic ring on my brother not knowing that it will harm him.
“I regret my actions because I am not supposed to have any gun under my roof without permission from the police. I was only trying to make sure that my brother got the right magic ring that would protect him from gun shots. I beg the police to forgive me.”
