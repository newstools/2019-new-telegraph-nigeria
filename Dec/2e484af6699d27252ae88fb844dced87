 D elta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, has promised the people of Warri, Uvwie and other neighbouring towns that the first phase of the N18 billion storm water project approved to checkmate perennial flooding in the locality would commence next year. Six major storm drainages had been designed to ease yearly flooding problems in the two major cities, Warri and Uvwie.  The governor said his administration was unperturbed that the first phase contract awarded to CCECC Limited and Levante Construction Limited respectively, would gulp over N9 billion.  Governor Okowa, who spoke as a special guest of honour during a thanksgiving service for his Commissioner for Technical Education, Mrs. Gbubemi Kpenosen-Ikolo, at the Unity Baptist Church, Warri, vowed to restore the lost glory of Warri by tackling flooding permanently in the city.  He said: “Construction of the first phase of storm water drainage projects in Warri South and Uvwie will be starting in January; the contracts for the projects have been awarded at a cost of N9.5 billion. “It is our desire to restore the lost glory of Warri and Uvwie and we want the cooperation of everyone for us to have seamless execution of projects.”  He said the appointment of Ikolo as a commissioner came through inspiration from God and maintained that she did not lobby for the position. “The appointment did not come from me, it came from God; so, we will return the thanks to Him; the Lord will direct your paths for you to succeed, becausethe real thing is about the success story at the end and when God directs your steps, it will be a success story,” he said.  He urged the politician to humble herself and serve humanity without fear or favour, even as he said within few months of her appointment, a new technical college was approved for Omadino, another in Uvwie and another one in Irri parts of the state.
