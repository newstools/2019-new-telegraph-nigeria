 The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, has set up a Special Strike Force to deal with One Millions Boys, No Salary Boys and Awawa Boys, who allegedly have been terrorising residents of the state.   The police said that the miscreants were responsible for series of violent crimes and attacks in different parts of the state. They also engaged in traffic robberies, murder and rape.   The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Bala Elkana, said that during the inauguration of Unit at the weekend, the CP tasked the team with the responsibility of dislodging the miscreants completely from the state. Elkana said that the team’s operations were going to be intelligence driven.   His words: “The strike team would take the battle to their hideouts and their doorsteps. Members of the teams were drawn from Tactical Units, State Intelligence Bureau, Operations Departments and State Criminal Investigation Department.” The teams would be led by an Assistant Commissioner of Police, ACP Odubona Oludotun, who will also act and be address as the chairman.   Elkana noted that the team was established in response to the recent activities of miscreants in Ijegun, Itire and Isheri areas, where they vandalised vehicles and property of citizens without a reason. He, however, disclosed that 11 suspects have been arrested in connection with the vandalism.   Items recovered from the suspects were two locally made pistols, 11 axes, nine cutlasses, four daggers and charms. Elkana said: “The CP is sending a strong warning to members of such violent gangs that the Command will pursue, subdue and bring them to justice.”
