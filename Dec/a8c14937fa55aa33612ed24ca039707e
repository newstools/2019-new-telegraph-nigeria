  The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has told the All Progressives Congress (APC) that its planned one-party government will not stand. The party, which was reacting to a statement by the APC on Tuesday, stated that no amount of blackmail, orchestration of violence, killings and forceful seizure of electoral processes by the ruling party, would make PDP drop its call for electoral reforms. In a statement Wednesday by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the main opposition party noted that its proposed electoral reforms will return Nigeria to democratic practice that engenders respect to the rights of the citizens for free, fair, clean, clear and credible elections. “APC’s ultimate design is to use violence, intimidation, attacks, blackmail and threats against the PDP to frighten Nigerians and scare them from participating in electoral processes, then upset our democratic order and perpetuate a one-party despotic regime in our nation. “This is the reason the APC is averse to our pro-people call for electoral reforms in our country,” PDP said. It described APC’s attack as diversionary tactics to enable it sustain its ‘coup’ against democracy through the use of state apparatus and paid hoodlums to unleash brute force, arbitrary arrests and bloodletting. PDP remarked that impunity, violations and political brigandage are not part of the tenets of democracy.
