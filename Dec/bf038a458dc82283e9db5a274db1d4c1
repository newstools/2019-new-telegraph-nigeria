… says victim’s father didn’t give him money to marry third wife   Police in Ogun State have arrested four suspected kidnappers for allegedly killing a seven-year-old boy, Abdulmalik Musa, after collecting a ransom of N300,000 from his parents. Incidentally, one of the suspects, Farouq Seidu, is a younger brother of the victim’s father, Abdulhamid Musa Chindo. The other kidnappers are Hassan Hussein (30), Abeeb Nura (24) and Mohammed Bello (42). The state Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, who confirmed the arrest of the suspects, disclosed that they murdered the victim and dumped his remains in Ogun River. The suspects were said to have initially demanded a ransom of N5 million after which they agreed to collect N300,000 from parents of the deceased. Hundreds of residents thronged the Enu-Gada area of Abeokuta to catch a glimpse of the body of the boy which was floating as at press time. Briefing journalists, Oyeyemi said the mastermind of the kidnapping, Seidu, claimed that he contracted others over the refusal of the boy’s father to give him money to marry a third wife. The PPRO stated that the suspects murdered the victim after he recognised one of them as his uncle. He said: “This is a case of a breakthrough in respect of an abduction and murder. It is the height of man’s inhumanity to man. “On 11th of December, a case of abduction was reported at Sabo Division at Ilupeju. About 24 hours after, the kidnappers made a request of N5 million and we (police) asked the family to play along with them and later they (suspects) agreed to take N300,000 and after payment, they still killed the boy and threw his corpse into the river. “I want to appeal to members of the public to trust nobody; because if a brother can do this to his brother, who should then be trusted?”
