T he Niger State Police Command has arrested 38-year-old Yakubu Abubakar for allegedly shooting his brother with a pistol.   Abubakar was arrested at Paiko Village in the Paikoro Local Government Area of the state after he was found with a fabricated locally made pistol.  It was gathered that Abubakar, a vigilante of Aninigi Village, was trailed and arrested by a team of policemen attached to Paikoro Division based on information.  The suspect was said to have given his brother Yakubu Zakari, a magic ring, believed to be a bullet proof that will protect him from gunshots in case of any eventualities.  It was reliably gathered that the suspect tested the power of the ring on the victim by firing twice without success, but his third attempt got the victim, who was rushed to the IBB Specialist Hospital Minna for medical attention.   The suspect said: “I am not a thief or a killer. I only fired the gun to test the power of the magic ring on my brother not knowing that it will harm him. I regret my actions because I am not supposed to have any gun under my roof without permission from the police. I was only trying to make sure that my brother got the right magic ring that would protect him from gunshots. I beg the police to forgive me.”   The Niger State Deputy Police Public Relations Officer (DPPRO), Uthuman Umar, while confirming the arrest, said, “The Command will no longer tolerate unlawful possession of firearms in the state. We have warned people to desist or face the wrath of the law.”   Umar said that the operatives recovered from the suspect a locally made pistol, adding that the matter would be charged to court after investigation.
