Akeem Nafiu The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has re-arraigned a former Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Hon. Adeyemi Ikuforiji and his aide, Oyebode Atoyebi, for alleged laundering of N673 million at a Federal High Court in Lagos. The duo were re-arraigned Wednesday on a 54-count charge bordering on the alleged offence before Justice Mohammed Liman. Upon the reading of the charge to them, they, however, pleaded not guilty to all the counts. Afterwards, EFCC’s lawyer, E.E. Iheanacho, sought for a trial date and asked that the defendants be remanded in prison. Responding to the lawyer’s request, Justice Liman said it will be inappropriate for him to order the prison remand of the defendants because they have already been granted bail by the former judge who handled the matter. “The defendants will not be remanded in prison because they were already on bail. The case was only previously aborted due to the filing of no case submissions by the defendants.The court only need to be sure their sureties are still available,” Justice Liman said. Upon the agreement of parties, the judge adjourned the matter to February 5, 2020, for commencement of trial. He also ordered the defence to produce evidence showing the willingness of the defendants’ sureties to continue to stand for them within two weeks failure which a warrant of arrest might be issued against the defendants.
