National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), Lagos Zonal Command, has arrested mother for allegedly compelling their 13-year-old maid to eat faeces. The woman’s son was also arrested for allegedly sexually abusing the girl. According to NAPTIP, the two suspects were arrested at the Okota area of the state for child abuse. The mother and son allegedly continually abused the house help. NAPTIP alleged that while the mother meted out different forms of untold abuses ranging from beating to forcing her to eat faeces, the son on the other hand molested the girl sexually. Preliminary investigations have commenced in earnest, according to the Zonal Commander, Daniel Atokolo. He said: “I want to assure members of the public that the suspects will be dully prosecuted to send signals to others that think that house helps are lesser human beings.” In another development, NAPTIP and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), in a joint operation, have arrested a man, Patrick aka DJ Max, for allegedly using young girls for commercial sex work. The joint operation was carried out on December 16. According to NAPTIP, the suspect has been on the agency’s wanted list for long. He is also alleged to be on the wanted list of the police and anti-narcotic agency. Patrick was arrested in one of his hideout hotels at Okota area of Lagos while his victim was rescued. It was learnt that NAPTIP received intelligence report about the hideout and quickly moved in with a team of NSCDC officers, who provided arm cover for NAPTIP operatives. The suspect made attempt to scale the fence but only stopped at the risk of death. It was further alleged that Patrick specialised in using young girls for commercial sex work thereby exploiting them. He is currently in NAPTIP custody while investigation into the case is ongoing. The victim had been admitted into the shelter for counselling and rehabilitation process.
