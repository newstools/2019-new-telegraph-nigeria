The Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) has honoured Nigeria Information Technology Reporters’ Association (NITRA) with the Telecoms Industry Support Award in recognition of its efforts at sustaining the telecoms industry and charting a proper course through the platform. The award was presented at a recent ceremony attended by several industry stakeholders in Lagos. According to the award organisers, NITRA won the award for its contribution to the telecoms industry since it was inaugurated in 2017, having been in operation since 2015. While receiving the award, NITRA Chairman, Emma Okonji, said the award was an indication of the immense work done by the association to smoothen the operations of the telecoms industry across the country. Okonji thanked the organisers of the award for the recognition and promised that NITRA would always ensure that its members give their best to the industry for the operators, regulators, customers and other stakeholders to offer and get excellent services. “We feel honoured for this award from ALTON. Beyond being a close partner with ALTON, we have been at the forefront of issues concerning the telecoms industry. This gesture is a spurring symbol for NITRA to contribute more to the industry and the country,” Okonji said. In his remarks in honour of NITRA, ALTON Chairman, Engr. Gbenga Adebayo, commended NITRA for her doggedness in setting agenda for the industry through the members’ objective reportage. According to Adebayo, ALTON, which is an umbrella body of all licensed telecom operators, will continue to protect telecoms investment in Nigeria and ensure telecoms expansion across the country. NITRA, under the purview of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, is an umbrella body for journalists reporting information and communications technology in Nigeria.
