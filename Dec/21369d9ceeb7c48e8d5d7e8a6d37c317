By Muritala Ayinla Disturbed by the rate of environmental pollution in its host community, the Lagos State government has shut down the popular Quilox Night Club over environmental pollution. The club is allegedly owned by Mr. Shina Peller, a member of the Federal House of Representative, representing the Iseyin/ Itesiwaju/Iwajowa/Kajola Constituency in Oyo Dtate. According to the General Manager, Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LASEPA) , Dr Fasawe Fasawe, the luxurious hangout bar, which is situated at 873, Ozumba Mbadwe Ave, Victoria Island, Lagos, was shut down at exactly 1:30pm on Monday afternoon for incessant noise pollution. She said that the club was violating the right of residents to peaceful ambience without recourse to the extant law guiding its operations of maintaining standard permissible noise levels. Dr Fasawe, who led the enforcement exercise, said that the closure of the club’s premises came on the heels of several complaints from the public on persistent traffic gridlocks and noise pollution emanating from Quilox. According to her: “LASEPA does not discriminate in the discharge of its duties, especially when implementing the Lagos State law on eradication of environmental nuisances across the state. We perform our responsibilities without fear or favour.” She said that the agency has been enforcing its mandate all around the state, based on petitions received from the publics and follow due procedures for effective service delivery for smooth operations and to also avoid hoax calls and misrepresentation of facts.
