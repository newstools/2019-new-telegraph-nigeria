A rights organisation, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), has hailed President Muhammadu Buhari’s directive for the release of the Convener of #RevolutionNowgroup, Omoyele Sowore and a former National Security Adviser (NSA), Col. Sambo Dasuki (rtd.), from custody. While describing the action as a positive step by the Federal Government, SERAP said it hoped it will signal a change in direction in Nigeria towards full respect for the rule of law, tolerance and greater openness by those in authority. In a statement by its Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, SERAP asked the Federal Government to immediately withdraw all charges against Sowore, his co-accused, Olaware Bakare and all others detained simply for exercising their right to freedom of expression, saying they ought not to be charged in the first place. The statement reads: “We have consistently called for the immediate and unconditional release of Sowore, Olawale Bakare and other prisoners of conscience. The President Buhari’s government should now immediately withdraw all charges against Sowore and Olaware Bakare and all others detained simply for exercising their right to freedom of expression. They should never have been charged in the first place. “The President Buhari government must cease the restrictions on the civic space, respect human rights and immediately obey all outstanding court orders, including at least four judgements obtained by SERAP.”
