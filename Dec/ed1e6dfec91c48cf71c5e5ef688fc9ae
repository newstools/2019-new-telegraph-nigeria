Police in Niger State say gunmen have kidnapped two expatriates, a Nigerian staff of Triacta Construction Company and five others in Galadima Kogo village of Erena in Shiroro Local Government Area of the state. The two expatriate workers were said to be handling the construction work on the 52-kilometer road from Erena town to Kaure village, a border town between Niger and Kaduna state, cutting across over 200 villages. The contract for the road was awarded by the former Senator representing Niger East Senatorial District, Senator David Umaru in 2018 and has continued with the work despite his exit from the red chamber. The Commissioner of Police, Mr Adamu Usman, who disclosed this in Minna on Tuesday, said the gunmen, who wore military uniforms came to the village on over 20 motorcycles and attacked workers of the construction firm. Usman said the incident occurred on Monday at about 12:45 hours along Shiroro-Galadima road.
