R.T Briscoe has continued to witness series of losses in profits following operational challenges. Chris Ugwu writes  R .T Briscoe Plc like some other automobile companies has seen continuous negative position in bottom line as instability in the economy continues to impact adversely on its operations due to reduction in credit opportunities. Its financials had also remained in the red for over four years continuing into the current year.   According to reports, the journey to this sorry state did not begin overnight. The company made the mistake of investing in only cyclical sectors of the economy, without competitive model. While it started as one of the major dealers in Toyota products, luck soon ran out as other companies gradually began to sell Toyota cars too.   Ford Motor Company ended its 11-year partnership with Briscoe, saying it did not make commercial sense to have two dealers operating in the same country. Coscharis Motors thus became the sole distributor of Ford vehicles in the country, leaving RT Briscoe stuck with unsold cars and spare parts.  The company, which came from a loss position in 2015 and 2016 in the same trend, ended 2017 unimpressive, finished 2018 with losses in after tax profits and also ended the first, second and third quarters of 2019 in red to what market analysts attributed to heavy cost of servicing bank and cost of sales and administrative expenses.  The share price, which closed at 35 kobo per share in January, 2019 recorded a drop in value that when the closing bell rang on Friday, the company’s share price stood at 21 kobo, a decline of 40 per cent or 14 kobo year to date. Financials  Despite efforts by the management, the group, coming from loss position since 2015, has continued to sustain negative posture.  Though the group closed the year 2018 with 18 per cent increase in revenue from 4.376 billion in 2017 to N5.182 billion in 2018 full year ended December 2018, the firm reported a loss after tax of N2.188 billion in 2018, from N3.160 billion in 2017. Loss before tax stood at N2.168 billion from N3.137 billion in 2017. According to the company, the automobile industry in Nigeria is currently undergoing very challenging times. Industry monitors revealed that the sales of brand new vehicles dropped significantly from about 50,000 units in 2013 to below 10,000 units in 2017 as well as in 2018, largely due to the prohibitive costs of imported fully built new vehicles which attract 70 per cent import duties.  “The situation in 2019 as at the time of writing has unfortunately largely remained the same. It is in this light that I review the results of the R.T. Briscoe group for the 2018 financial year. Despite the harsh operating environment, the group recorded an 18 per cent growth in revenue from N4.4 billion in 2017 to N5.2 billion in 2018.  “The significant improvement in revenue was attributable to the activities of the sales functions for motor vehicles and technical equipment which accounted for about 90 per cent of the group’s revenue while the sales of property units and rent from investment properties held by the company’s real estate subsidiary, Briscoe Properties Limited was responsible for the rest,” it noted.  The group began the financial year 2019 with a loss after tax of N214.270 million for the first quarter ended March 30, 2019 from a loss of N994.013 million in 2018. Cost of sales grew by 99 .56 per cent to N1.253 billion in 2019 from N627.868 million in 2018. Revenue grew by 76.43 per cent from N894.931 million in 2018 to N1.579 billion in 2019.  R.T Briscoe continued to be subdued by rising costs during the half year ended June 30 2019 as its cost of sales grew by 39.84 per cent to close at N2.397 billion in 2019 from N1.714 billion recorded in 2018. Revenue grew by  29.37 per cent to N3.070 billion from N2.373 billion in 2018. Loss after tax stood at N424.331 million from N1.710 billion reported in 2018. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the group reported a loss after tax of N680.677 million from N1.190 billion posted in 2018. However its revenue grew by 19.79 per cent to N4.237 billion from N3.537 billion in 2018, but cost of sales rose by 27.78 per cent to close at N3.311 billion from N2.591 billion in 2019. Operational challenges The Acting Chairman of the company, Sir Sunday Nwosu, addressing shareholders at the 2018 AGM, said the three major threats to the going concern status of the company over the past few years had been its liquidity challenges due to chronic undercapitalization, loss-making business situation including the winding-up petition and another court case, which arose due to inability of the company to settle its indebtedness to its bankers. Nwosu, who noted that the major threat to the going concern status of the company were being firmly addressed and the results slow but encouraging, explained that the board and indeed the shareholders were concerned about the liquidity challenges of the company and taking steps to resolve the situation.   “It would be recalled that our shareholders at two separate AGMs in 2014 and subsequently in 2016, authorized the board to raise up to N10 billion by way of equity, debt capital or a combination of both to recapitalise the company. To actualise this, the board retained the services of Lead Capital Plc as financial advisers, to identify potential investors and facilitate the recapitalisation exercise. “Recently, the services of Dunn Loren Merrifield Advisory Partners (DLM) were also engaged as investment advisers with the mandate to raise additional capital to refinance company’s existing debts, finance start-up of new business and enhance working capital. DLM has developed and recommended a rather distinctive recapitalization scheme.   “The scheme involves the institution of a money market fund with a life span of about 12-18 months, where existing shareholders of the company and other interested investors may subscribe to units of the offer by making a single lump sum payment or commit to pay in installments. A share conversion exercise involving the shares of the company would subsequently be consummated after the termination of the fund. The board has approved an engagement letter from DLM setting out comprehensively the terms and conditions of the fund raising exercise in preparation for formal applications to the regulatory authorities to kick start the process,” he said.   Nwosu explained that Diamond Bank Plc (now Access Bank) instituted an action at the Federal High Court in Lagos for the winding up of the company based on indebtedness to the bank. The case has been pending in court since June 2016 due to the various interlocutory applications before the court and several adjournments.   “It suffices to mention that the interlocutory applications for the appointment of a provisional liquidator and an interim official receiver respectively were dismissed as lacking merit by the court on June 11, 2018. Unsurprisingly, the bank recently applied to the court for the withdrawal of the winding-up petition. R.T. Briscoe would be raising no objection in principle to the withdrawal when it comes up for hearing at the next date in October, as this would put to rest the legal threat to our company’s existence, which also accounted largely for the qualified opinion in our audited financial statements for 2016. An action instituted by Guaranty Trust Bank at the Lagos High Court for N185.2 million is currently at the Case Management stage.   “Currently, our company’s total assets are about N7.7 billion as against total liabilities of about N15.9 billion with about N14.3 billion of this amount accounting for accrued bank interest and charges. The company is disputing the bank interest and charges, an unspecified significant part of which the banks have informally agreed to waive on receipt of an attractive repayment proposal. Prospective investors have however insisted on a forensic audit of the debts as a pre-condition for a firm and binding proposal. Preliminary reports by engaged forensic auditors who are yet to conclude their assignments indicate significant excess charges by the banks. The Asset Management Company of Nigeria has taken over the debts due to the erstwhile Skye Bank (now Polaris Bank),” he said.   Outlook Nwosu noted that the future of the company was in its ability to reposition itself and chart a different course in the very competitive auto industry which currently accounts for about 70 per cent of our business activities.   “We are currently also focusing on and developing our technical and real estate businesses which have shown promising prospects over the years but have had restricted growth due to limited working capital. Our company holds licences (now due for renewal) for the assembling of motor vehicles and generators in Nigeria and in this regard, we are currently reinforcing our relationship with BYD, a global leader in electric automobiles, metro transportation and alternative energy with a new MOU to be executed. The expected recapitalization of the company would give the needed impetus for the exponential growth of our various business activities,” he said. Last line R.T Briscoe needs to urgently raise more capital and concentrate on more profitable ventures to enable it come out of quagmire for optimal performance.
