P olice in Ogun State have arrested a member of an armed robbery gang allegedly terrorising Sagamu-Benin Expressway.   The suspect, Michael Edeh, was arrested on Saturday for allegedly hijacking a truckload of cocoa.  About five other accomplices, who also belong to the gang, fled on sighting the police patrol team attached to Obalende Division in Ijebu-Ode.

Oyeyemi, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, stated that the suspects tied the truck driver on both hands and legs and dumped him in the bush.   He said: “On receiving the information, the (police) team headed to the scene but on sighting the policemen, the hoodlums took to their heels and escaped through the bush.   “The bush was thoroughly combed resulting to the arrest of Michael Edeh who has been interrogated and confessed being a member of robbery syndicate who specialised in hijacking truck loaded with goods on the expressway at gunpoint.”
