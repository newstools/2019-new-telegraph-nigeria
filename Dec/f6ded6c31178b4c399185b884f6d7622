Chris Ugwu writes that rising operational challenges have impacted negatively on earnings of Okomu Oil Palm Plc.   Over dependent to oil and gas as major source of revenue has continue to remain major factors that contributed to Nigeria’s inability to meet up with the global rise in demand for palm oil.   Notwithstanding, the likes of Presco Oil Plc and Okumo Oil Plc, two big commercial operators in the Nigerian palm oil sector have shown commitment in improving Nigerian economic outlook in the International community and bringing it out of the doldrums that has plagued it for over three decades, though, without challenges in financials of the companies.   Currently, efforts are being made to boost the agricultural sectors that the country once neglected. Oil palm is one notable area that Nigeria can produce and provide millions of job. Nigeria oil palm industry is dominated by smallholders and to lesser extent semi-mechanized and mechanized processors. Smallholders and semi-mechanized palm oil processors account for about 95 per cent of the total domestic production.  For effective production, the role of the drivers is essential. These include farmers, processors, marketers/consumers and equipment fabricators.   For Nigeria to be able to increase her share of domestic production reduces importation and produce palm oil with improved quality, the challenges of the drivers need to be addressed.   While it was accepted generally that the overall economic and business climate was a mixed fortune due to mounting economic challenges, Okomu Oil was not insulated, as following recurrent disappointing results its third quarter 2019 profits equally dropped by 43.22 per cent and share price movements have also declined, the company like others have remained susceptible to the challenges facing the manufacturing businesses in Nigeria.   In spite that market sentiments for the company has remained firm not only on the back of demand for palm oil, which outstrips local supply by almost 50 per cent but also beyond palm oil as rubber, which it also produce offers diversification opportunities, the share price stood at N82.00 per share in January 2019, declined by 32.93 per cent or N27 to closed at N355.00 per share when the closing bell rang on Friday.   Financials   Contrary to expectation of analysts that 2018E will record growth, Okomu Oil Palm posted a 8.73 per cent drop in profit after tax for the financial year ended December 31, 2018.   According to the audited report obtained from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), the company recorded a profit after tax of N8.501 billion in 2018 as against N9.314 billion posted in 2017, representing a drop of 8.73 per cent.   Profit before tax declined by 7.21 per cent to N10.337 billion during the period under review from N11.140 billion a year earlier.   Revenue equally declined marginally by 0.019 per cent from N20.261 billion in 2017 to N20.251 billion in 2018.   Okomu Oil’s Q1 2019 earnings came in weaker than expected, down -71 per cent y/y to N1.0 billion.   In Q1, all key line items on the P&L worsened on a y/y basis. While sales were down -43 per cent y/y, PBT and PAT both fell by -68 per cent y/y and -71 per cent y/y respectively. Sales for oil palm and rubber declined by –45 per cent y/y and -27 per cent y/y to N3.5 billion and N721 million respectively. The more substantial y/y decline on the PBT line was driven by a gross margin contraction of -1000bps y/y to 80 per cent.   According to FBNQuest, this completely offset any benefits accruing from a double-digit y/y decline in operating expenses. Sequentially, PBT and PAT both worsened even though sales grew by 18 per cent q/q. The trend was broadly similar in Q4 2018. Q4 sales of N3.6bn declined -2.8 per cent y/y, while PBT and PAT both declined by -18 per cent y/y and -63 per cent y/y to N1.6 billion and N1.3 billion respectively. The topline decline, the third in a row, was primarily driven by lower rubber sales which fell by around -11 per cent y/y to N879 million.   Okomu Oil Palm remained pressured as its second quarter 2019 result showed 38.4 per cent YoY decline in EPS to N1.60 emanating from lower CPO prices and higher operating cost (+26.7 per cent YoY to N1.9 billion) over the period. Factoring the Q2 19 numbers, cumulative H1 19 EPS declined 57.4 per cent YoY to N2.65.   According to analysts at ARM Research, following the bearish run in global CPO prices (-16 per cent YoY) alongside the infiltration of  CPO into Nigerian from neighboring countries, Okomu’s CPO revenue (-29.6 per cent YoY to N3.6 billion) remained pressured, while export revenue from sale of rubber rose (+58 per cent YoY to N730.6 million) on the back of higher global rubber prices (+18 per cent YoY).   “Overall, the company’s sales dipped (-22.4 per cent YoY to N4.3 billion) over the period. Reflecting the lower volumes sold over the period, cost of sales (-25.3 per cent YoY to N853 million) declined, largely from the Oil Palm (-31 per cent YoY) segment. While the gross margin expanded 80bps, gross profit declined 21.6% YoY to N3.5 billion over the period. This alongside higher operating expenses which in our view is reminiscent of ongoing expansion work in the company deteriorated operating profit (-46.3 per cent YoY to N1.6 billion), with EBIT margin contracting to 36.5 per cent from 52.7 per cent in the prior period,” they noted.   Okomu Oil Palm closed Q3, 2019 with a 43.22 per cent decrease in its profit after tax as at the period ended 30 September 2019 according to it’s interim financial statements published on the Nigerian Stock Exchange.   The financial statement showed that Okomu Oil generated N13.32 billion in Gross Profit over the past nine months of 2019. This is indicative of 7.37 per cent decrease compared to N14.38 billion which was generated in Q3 2018. Profit before tax also declined by 30.16 per cent to N6.09 billion in Q3 2019, down from N8.72 billion in Q3 2018.  Profit after tax dipped by 43.23 per cent to N4.11 billion, down from N7.24 billion in Q3 2018 while the company’s earnings per share for the period stood at N4.31, as against N7.59 in the third quarter of 2018.   Outlook Okomu Oil Palm recently notified the Nigerian Stock Exchange and investing Public that it has intensified steps to improve collaborative arrangement with Edo State Government in the Agricultural industry through partnership with the local communities and indigenous farmers to boost job creation and enhance modern agricultural techniques for increase in production.   “In line with the spirit of the Edo State Investment Promotion Office (ESIPO) the Company is determined to work with all relevant bodies in the training and support of aspiring youths in positive and productive direction.   “The Company’s involvement in the development of Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is geared towards establishing a sustainable oil palm growth and practice,” the company noted.   Analysts at InvestmentOne in its recent report on the outlook of the company said: “Going forward, we expect the company to continue to leverage on the supply deficit in the local market, which has been supported by government’s exclusion of importers of CPO from the official foreign exchange market.   “However, stability in the parallel FX market may encourage importation of CPO, thus reducing the current supply deficit gap in the long run. Also, recent complaint by local producers of CPO over illegal importation of palm oil highlights the challenges faced from smuggling. This may be negative for both volume and prices thus affecting revenue growth in the near term.   “On the international prices, we believe the decision of India (a major buyer of CPO) to cut import duties on CPO to 40 per cent from 44 per cent (effective January 2019) could continue to support prices as demand picks up from the country. Similarly, the growing interest in biodiesel from CPO as an alternative source of energy could be positive for CPO producers thus supporting a long run growth in demand in international market. These may support prices within the medium to long run.   “In the same vein, we expect the company’s rubber expansion plan to help to diversify its revenue base and generate foreign exchange income which may be used to hedge against the company’s FX exposure. Similarly, we opine that the newly commissioned plant, Extension 2 Estate in Q2 2018, may increase the company’s production capacity and support its top line performance in the long run. We highlight that the company has completely planted all arable areas and no further land for palm is available again.   “Similarly, we are of the view that the newly erected five mega-watts turbine at the oil mill may improve margin in the near term as it is expected to generate enough power for both Okomu and Extension 1, thus reducing higher energy cost from third party. Again, the expected improvement in consumer spending in H2 2019, on the back of minimum wage increase, could improve demand for CPO particular for the production of other consumer goods”.   Last line   Relegating palm oil as a result of crude oil discovery was a big gaffe that will continue to haunt Nigeria. The authorities have to come up with innovative policies to encourage palm oil production.
