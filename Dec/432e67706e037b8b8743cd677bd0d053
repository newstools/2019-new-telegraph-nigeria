The crown came off, and — more than a year later — so have the gloves. A Ukrainian beauty queen who was stripped of her titleafter pageant organizers learned she had a child is now suing the Miss World organisation, reports the New York Post. Veronika Didusenko, 24 announced her intention to fight the pageant bosses on their “discriminatory” policy that prohibits mothers or married women from participating in the pageants. “I have launched a legal challenge against @MissWorldand this marks the new phase in our joint fight for justice,” she wrote on Instagram. She says her argument hinges on the Equality Act of 2010, which “protects against discrimination based on certain characteristics, including marriage, maternity and sex,” she wrote. In September 2018, Didusenko, a divorced mother of one, won the Miss Ukraine pageant. But her reign didn’t last long. Four days later, the pageant poobahs stripped her of her title. “In accordance with the rules for conducting the National Beauty Contest ‘Miss Ukraine,’ a person who wishes to take part in the National Beauty Contest ‘Miss Ukraine’ must comply, among other things, with the following requirements (valid for the period of the contest): — not / was not married; — has no children,” the Miss Ukraine organisation said at the time. Didusenko, who has a 5-year-old son Alex, said she was aware of the rule prohibiting mothers from entering the contest. But she insists pageant organisers encouraged her to compete anyway. “Why should a woman be excluded from entering just because she’s a mother? It doesn’t make any sense,” she tells the BBC. “Being a mum doesn’t have any implication on my ability to be professional or be a successful model or do my job. So those rules didn’t make any sense to me.” She is being represented by human rights attorney Ravi Naik. The Miss World Pageant takes place December 14 in London. The organisation has not returned The Post’s requests for comment.
