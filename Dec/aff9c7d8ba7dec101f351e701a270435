AÂ security guard, identified as David Orji, was yesterday killed by an over speeding driver at Margaret Avenue, off PZ Junction, Aba-Owerri Road, Aba, Abia State. The driver of the Toyota Avalon, identified simply as Mustapha, a mechanic and worker of Automedics Company, was testing a car, which was under repair, but allegedly lost control due to over speeding. The deceased, a father of five, who happened to be a native of Edda in Ebonyi State, was a security guard of MTN, located at Margaret Avenue, where he met his untimely death. According to eyewitnesses, Mustapha, who constantly makes use of the road while testing vehicles, was warned some days ago to desist from over speeding, but allegedly failed to heed. One of the eyewitnesses, who gave his name as Kingsley, said Mustapha was over speeding and lost control, hitting the pillar supporting the gate of MTN office. The pillar fell and killed Orji on the spot. Kingsley said that the manner in which motorists speed around the avenue was dangerous for both residents and road users. He urged the appropriate authorities to add more bumps from Aba-Owerri road to PZ Junction, linking Margaret Avenue, to avoid reoccurrence of such incident. It was gathered that police officers from the Aba Area Command took control of the situation in order to avoid any form of breakdown of law and order.
