From Musa Pam, Jos Members of the Plateau State House of Assembly Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus have rejected the six months extension of the tenure of the Management Committee Chairmen of Barkin ladi, Riyom, Jos North and Jos South local government areas of the state by the APC members of the 9th Assembly. Minority Whip and Member Representing Langtang South State Constituency Hon. Sohchang Zingtim while briefing journalists at the State Assembly Complex alongside eight other PDP members rejected the tenure elongation. Zingtim said the PDP lawmakers are not in support of the tenure elongation of the Management Committee Chairmen, as it is contrary to the constitution. “We say no to tenure elongation of Management Committee Chairmen of the four LGCs, it is illegal and contrary to the constitution, we will resist any attempt by the APC to imposed illegality in the state,” he said. It would be recall that Governor Simon Lalong had on October 10th sworn in the Management Committee Chairmen to manage the affairs of the four local government areas for three months citing insecurity as a hindrance for conducting election in the four affected councils. However, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) members of the Plateau State House of Assembly on Tuesday extended the tenure of the Management Committee Chairmen. The Majority Leader and member representing Mikang State Constituency, Hon. Naanlong Daniel moved the motion at the plenary stating that government needs more time to restore peace and security in the four local government areas and to ensure that the Plateau State Independent Electoral Commission (PLASIEC) has all materials they need to conduct a free and fair elections. New Telegraph learnt that the PDP lawmakers were absent at the plenary leaving the APC members to unanimously agree on the six months extension.
