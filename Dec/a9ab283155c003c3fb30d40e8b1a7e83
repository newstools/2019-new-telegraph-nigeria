Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr is impressed by the versatility of Bordeaux young star Josh Maja, saying the former Sunderland striker is capable of playing in three offensive positions. Maja became the latest dual-eligible outfield player to be handed an international debut by the German football tactician when he replaced Victor Osimhen in the closing minutes of Nigeria’s 2-2 draw with Ukraine in September. Since October 1, the Bordeaux number 9 has been the most decisive Nigerian player in Europe’s top five leagues, contributing to six goals (four goals, two assists) in eight matches, including a hat-trick against Nimes. ”He was on our list of players to watch, he was already attracting our attention, although he was only playing in League One, because our scouts were studying him closely from England ….,” said Rohr to So Foot. ”This is not a chance, he seized his chance with the various injuries of his teammates, and his hat-trick is part of the progression he displays.” Rohr went on to reveal the role played by another Nigeria international Samuel Kalu in helping Maja settle at Bordeaux, having joined the club in January 2019. ”And when he arrived in Bordeaux, he was not alone: ​​there was another Nigerian, Samuel Kalu. So his integration, carried out in good working conditions and surrounded by a good staff, was facilitated. ”It could only move in the right direction. Above all he is quite versatile, on the offensive side: he can play at the three front positions, in a system with two or three attackers.”
