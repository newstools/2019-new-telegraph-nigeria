A Federal High Court, sitting in Abakaliki, Ebony State, has sentenced Christopher Achi, 28, to two years in prison for vandalism of power facility belonging to Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC). This development was made known to journalists yesterday by the Head of Communications, EEDC, Mr Emeka Ezeh.   The trial judge, Justice Choebe Ayua, convicted the accused for tampering and removal of electric cables, property of EEDC at Ihenu Uburu Community, an offence punishable under Section 1(10) Miscellaneous Offences Act Cap M17 LFN 2004. Ezeh acknowledged that vandalism was a major challenge hampering EEDC’s operations, stressing that the vandals usually drained transformer oil, remove feeder pillar unit, intermediate or up-riser cables, transformer winding coil, and other times remove the whole transformer.   Some other items vandalised included spans of aluminium conductors and other line fittings such as Port Insulators and Cross-Arms.  Ezeh recalled that some vandals were recently sent to prison for also attacking EEDC installations.  He noted that Uchechukwu Maduakor, a native of Ogwu Amanasa Village, Umuchu, Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State, was sentenced to seven years imprisonment, while in May, 2019, the duo of Obasi Nkama Ukpai and Orji Okporie, were sentenced to one year, six months imprisonment.  According to Ezeh, management of EEDC was not relenting in her commitment in ensuring that apprehended vandals were tried in accordance with the law and made to face the consequences of their actions. He said: “We believe that this will serve as deterrent to many others out there, engaging in such act. Customers are therefore advised to be vigilant and not allow installations within their neighbourhood to be vandalised.”
