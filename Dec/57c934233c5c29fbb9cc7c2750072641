 MTN Group will defend its views on lower data prices before a Competition Tribunal if the competition watchdog refers the case, Rob Shuter, chief executive of the South African telecoms group, said on Thursday. The countryâ€™s competition commission said earlier this month that Vodacom and MTN could face prosecution if they fail to cut data prices within two months, reports Reuters.
