The Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Benue State chapter, Reverend Akpen Leva on Tuesday called on President Muhammadu Buhari to fast-track the release of the kidnapped Dapchi schoolgirl, Leah Sharibu before he exits office in 2023.  Besides, the CAN Chairman also described the desperate plot by some Nigerians to push for a third term agenda for the President as an anti-Nigeria project.  Reverend Leva, who stated these in a statement by his media aide, Sam Tyav, a copy released to New Telegraph, lamented the hardship Leah Sharibu was passing through in the hands of  Boko Haram in captivity, noting that Nigerians were getting fed up with mere political statements on the abduction of the school girl.  “I condemn in strong terms the call for the third term for the President. I  wonder why somebody would even approach a court of law to seek constitutional amendment to favour third term for President Buhari, this is anti-Nigeria.
He further warned against trivializing  serious constitutional matters like the tenure of political office holders.  “No one should deliberately create controversy so as to launch himself in the pool of political relevance. There are different platforms to look for political relevance with ease,” he said.
