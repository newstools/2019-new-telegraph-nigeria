 A few hours after Acting Head, Department of Dramatic Arts of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Dr. Victoria Oluwaremilekun Adeniyi directed the 44th Convocation play of the institution, the management of the university, yesterday, announced her demise.   Adeniyi was said to have died at the University’s Teaching Hospital. The institution’s Public Relations Officer, Mr. Biodun Olanrewaju, who made this known via in a press statement in Osogbo, said that the deceased was part of the academic procession of the grand finale of the University’s Convocation held last Saturday.   As at the time of filing in this report, the cause of her death still remains cloudy.   The statement, however reads in part: “After we lost a Professor of Paediatrics, Professor Jerome Elusiyan, to the cold hands of death through the instrumentality of gunmen. It is too painful for us as a university to tearfully break the unpalatable news of the demise of another promising academic and a prominent member of OAU community, Dr. Victoria Oluwaremilekun Adeniyi, who, until her death early this morning, was the Acting Head, Department of Dramatic Arts of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife. The lecturer, who directed this year’s convocation play, staged four days ago, was also yesterday, a part of the academic procession of the grand finale of the university’s 44th Convocation.”   Olanrewaju further noted that the Vice Chancellor, Professor Eyitope Ogunbodede, who was visibly unhappy, had visited the University’s Teaching Hospital and directed that necessary papers be filled for the conduct of a post mortem.
