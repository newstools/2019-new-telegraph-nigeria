… Says Nigerian should look for another opposition party The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that lack of a virile opposition political party is a threat to the country’s democracy. According to the ruling party, Nigeria needs an opposition political party as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) no longer provide virile opposition. APC, in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issah-Onilu, said no any amount of electoral reform would bring back PDP as an acceptable party. Onilu, in the statement said: “The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has become disillusioned by the string of election victories recorded by the All Progressives Congress (APC) – 2019 Presidential Election, majority governoship wins, National Assembly seats and other governorship elections in Ekiti, Osun, Kano, Kogi and Bayelsa states. “Infact, Prince Uche Secondus, PDP’s National Chairman on Monday lamented that it would be difficult for the PDP to participate in future elections in the country. “This is exactly our fear. Is this not a confirmation of APC’s earlier position that Nigeria was fast becoming a one-party State as a result of the rudderless and soulless PDP, Nigeria’s supposed main opposition party? “No doubt, our country deserves a strong and vibrant opposition to play its conventional role in the polity and to deepen democracy. The PDP has shown crass and shocking incapacity to perform that role. As a party that believes in democracy and progressive politics, we are worried by this obvious vacuum. “No rigorous and intelligent interrogation of the current administration’s policies and programmes by the PDP. Just idle chatter, propagation of fake news, post-election delusions and other unpatriotic conducts. This is dangerous for our democracy. “The APC hereby invites other registered political parties to step up and perform the crucial opposition role the PDP has failed so woefully to play.”
