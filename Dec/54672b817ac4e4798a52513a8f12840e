The leadership of the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) under the leadership of Comrade Uchenna Madu has faulted the claims of Chief Ralph Uwazuruike, the founder of Biafran Independent Movement (BIM) and Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) purporting that their leader Uchenna Madu was reaching out to him for a pardon.
Reacting to a press statement by Chris Mocha, the spokesman of Chief Ralph Uwazuruike, the group dismissed Uwazuruike as merely angling for relevance while stressing that “Uwazuruike cannot eat his cake and still have it”.
“Uwazuruike can neither regain the years he wasted nor the goodwill of Ndigbo he so blatantly squandered; now he is ready to do anything no matter how bizarre to gain relevance,” they said.
According to a statement signed by Comrade Edeson Samuel, the group’s National Director of Information, the separatist group said that their leader has neither had any direct nor indirect meeting with Chief Ralph Uwazuruike.
It read in part: “Our leader, Comrade Uchenna Madu has never called, texted or chatted with Ralph Uwazuruike directly or through someone’s phone since 2014 when MASSOB separated from him. MASSOB received the news that our leader is begging or appealing for pardon from Ralph Uwazuruike with shock.”
