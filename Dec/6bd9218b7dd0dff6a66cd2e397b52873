Justice A. T. Badamasi of a Kano State High Court on Tuesday declined to grant an extension on the interim order he gave last week barring the state governor from interfering with the powers of the Kano Emirate kingmakers. Counsel to the kingmakers, Barrister Nasiru Dangida in suit No K/197/2019, was asking the court to extend the order pending the determination of the substantive suit. The import of today’s ruling would be that the governor is now effectively capable of exercising all the powers vested in him under the new ‘Kano State Emirates Council Law, 2019’. This includes the power to dethrone any emir found violating any of the provisions of the law.
