Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has assured that more women will be appointed into the state executive council as well as agencies and boards of the state government. Abiodun, who allayed the fears of women as protests continued to trail his list of commissioner-nominees, said new commissionership positions reserved exclusively for women would be unveiled shortly. The governor gave the assurance in a statement released in Abeokuta and made available to reporters on Monday. Abiodun, who noted that the recently released commissioners list was not exhaustive, said the interests of women remained at the forefront of his administration’s agenda. He added that his promise that women would play a pivotal role in his administration remained irreversible. He explained that the choice of a female, Mrs Noimot Salako-Oyedele, as his deputy was to drive women-focused programmes in the state, adding that already, a number of his Special Advisers and cabinet-rank members are women. Abiodun stressed that in addition to appointing women as Senior Special Assistants and Special Assistants, his administration’s recent appointment of Mrs Amope Chokor as the Head of Service was a practical demonstration of his firm belief in and recognition of the brilliance, intelligence and commitment of women to the development of the state.
