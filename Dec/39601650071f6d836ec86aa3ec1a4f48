Amaechi tweeted: “Some minutes ago, I was attacked by a few misguided Nigerians while on national assignment at a climate change event in Madrid, Spain. They were quickly repelled by the Spanish police before they could do any harm. I am fine. I was not hurt.  Thanks for your support and prayers.” At the time, Nnamdi Kanu, IPOB leader, described the attack as targeting “those engaged in selling (Igbo) collective interest to Fulani caliphate”.
