…blasts NFF over beach soccer blackout  Ex-international, Etim Esin, has called on French Ligue 1 side, Lille, to allow Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen, regains his confidence before being allow to return to the pitch. It would be recalled that the former junior international was rushed to hospital Tuesday night after helping his club secured passage to the last eight of the French League Cup with a 3-0 defeat of Monaco. Osimhen opened scoring for Lille in the game before he was replaced after just 23 minutes and then taken to hospital when he complained of being unwell. Although the club already announced that the striker is “back to normal”, Esin however said he must be allowed to fully recuperate. “He should be given a little time off the pitch for now, thank God he is okay, it could have been worse,” he said. “We had players like Samuel Okparaji in the past, Marc-Vivien Foé of Cameroon and some others who just slumped like that and didn’t come out alive. “He should be allowed to recuperate and get his confidence back because when you experienced such situation, you have to really gain back your confidence because at the moment, he will be panicking.” He described the striker as the future of Nigerian football as he urged him to print his name on the sand of time like the previous strikers. He hopes the striker maintains his consistency for club and country as he looks forward to a big club signing him up soon. Meanwhile, Esin has described the decision of the Nigeria Football Federation to pull the country out of every international Beach Soccer competition as rubbish. Esin, while speaking with New Telegraph, said the sport was global and for a country as big as Nigeria to announce that they are no longer going to be part of it is a big cause for concern. According to him, the team were has been doing well in the past and because they failed to perform well recently doesn’t mean they are not good but there is need to invest more in the game.
