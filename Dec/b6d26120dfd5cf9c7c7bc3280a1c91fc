The N600 million metallurgical science laboratory located in Abuja rots away more than eight years after the facility was built to cater for critical analysis of aeroplanes during crashes. Commissioner, Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB), Akin Olateru made the disclosure yesterday when the House of Representatives Committee on Aviation rounded off its oversight of the aviation sector at the AIB head office in Lagos.  He said the facility had not ben put to use because of the Abuja-Kaduna rail line that passed through the laboratory, describing it as AIBâ€™s weakest link.

This is advanced stage of accident investigation where you want to determine the state and condition of the material. Some material failures can be examined in this laboratory to ascertain the failure of the metal; was it before the accident or by the impact of the accident.  Recently, the agency signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the University of Lagos (UNILAG) and the University of Ilorin on the use of its metallurgical laboratory at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport (NAIA), Abuja. Commissioner of AIB, Akin Olateru, while signing the agreement in Lagos, said the laboratory was to the benefit of Nigeria, students of higher institutions of learning and industries in the country.  Olateru said that the pact would save Nigeria huge capital flights, which would have been expended on air tickets, hotels and others by researchers, adding that collaborations enhance mutual benefits.
