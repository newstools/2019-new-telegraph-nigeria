P rominent traditional rulers in Yewa land in Ogun state have commended foremost entrepreneur, Aliko Dangote, for establishing one of the biggest cement plants in the area; thus bringing development and economic emancipation to the people in the grassroots in the area.  The commendation came during the commissioning of several projects constructed by Dangote Cement Plc, Ibese, for its 14 host communities as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The commissioning was followed by award of scholarships to 115 deserving host community pupils and students in primary, secondary, and higher institutions across the country.  Some of the projects commissioned by the Cement Plant Director, Azad Nawabuddin, included blocks of classrooms, transformers, health centre, water projects, flood channels, boreholes, e.t.c, all spread across the host communities. Extolling the virtues of Aliko Dangote on behalf of the Olu of Aga Olowo, Oba Kayode Adio Kusoro and Olu of Onigbedu, Oba Mathew Ajibulu, the Olu of Imashayi, Oba Gbadebo Oni said the communities were lucky to be beneficiaries of Dangote’s large heart.  He described the siting of Dangote Cement plant in the area as a blessing and that through various CSR projects done by the company, the communities, which are rural, were now having facilities, which were otherwise unattainable if not for the presence of Dangote Cement.   The monarch said the host communities were happy with the company’s handling of community issues, saying that Aliko Dangote deserves all the cooperation the entire Yewa land could muster for establishing the cement plant in their land and also taking care of the people and the communities. He promised that his people would continue to give peace a chance always, because to whom much is given, much is expected. The monarch said the scholarship is the best thing that has happened to the host communities because the issue of quality education cannot be quantified in monetary terms.
