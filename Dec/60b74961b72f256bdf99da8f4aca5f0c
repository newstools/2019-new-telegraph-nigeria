 A damawa State Police Command has arrested 319 suspected criminals in various parts of the state between July till date. The suspected criminals committed various offences such as kidnapping, armed robbery, rape, culpable homicide, cattle rustling among others.   Disclosing this yesterday while reviewing activities of the command in the last six months, Adamawa State Commissioner of Police, Mr Audu Madaki, explained that out of the total number of arrested suspects, 285 had been charged to various courts while 34 others were undergoing investigations.   Items recovered from the suspects include arms and ammunitions including six AK 47 rifles, 465 parcels of Indian hemp, large quantity of hard drugs, 236 cutlasses, 139 knives, two single barrel guns, six plasma TV, 13 tricycles as well as a Toyota Camry vehicle. On the forthcoming local government elections in the state, the commissioner explained that 5000 policemen as well as security personnel from other sister agencies were on ground for the successful conduct of the elections. He used the briefing to advise politicians, especially those seeking political offices, to ensure total compliance with the election guidelines to avoid confrontation and attack with their personal security. Responding the questions on the commandâ€™s challenges, the commissioner decried the non-challant attitude of some indigenes in their effort to fighting crimes, saying to reduce the crime rate in the state, the indigenes must be in good working relationship with security operatives.   Madaki, however, revealed that during the period under review, the command lost two police officers while on duty in Mubi. He urged the people in the state not to relent until the environment is rid of all criminal activities.
