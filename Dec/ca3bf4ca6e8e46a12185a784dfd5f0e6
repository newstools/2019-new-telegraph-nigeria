Armed men yesterday kidnapped a Catholic priest, Rev. Fr. Samuel Agwameseh, the Parish Priest of St. Lawrence Catholic Church, Issele-Mkpitime in Aniocha North Local Government Area of Delta State. Agwameseh was abducted by men alleged to be herdsmen of Fulani extraction. The kidnap has thrown the entire Catholic faithful in Issele-Uku Diocese into crisis as his abductors have demanded N20 million ransom. The suspects immediately contacted a fellow priest in the diocese and threatened to kill the abductee if reasonable action was not taken to secure his release. It was learnt that the victim was abducted on his way from Onicha-Olona where he had gone for the production of the Sunday bulletin for his parish where he had spent up 10 years. The kidnappers were said to have been provoked with the N300,000 being negotiated with them. A source within the Catholic fold said the victim’s problem was compounded when an alert of N800,000 entered his phone which was in possession of the kidnappers. “A vigilante, who is suspected to be an informant to the kidnapers, has been arrested. He is said to be frustrating the operations that may lead to the rescue of the victim,” the source said. The vigilante allegedly misled the team that went in search of the victim in a bush path leading to the hideout of the hoodlums, which forced them to relocate to another area. The Diocesan Publicity Director, Rev. Fr. Charles Agunwa, confirmed Agwameseh’s abduction. According to him, the church does not pay ransom but will instead intensity prayers for the victim’s safety. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya, confirmed that the kidnappers had made contact with the family of the priest. She said the command would never be part of paying ransom to rescue victim.
