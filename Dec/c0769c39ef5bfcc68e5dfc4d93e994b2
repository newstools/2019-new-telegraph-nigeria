The Senator representing Niger East Senatorial District, Senator Mohammed Sani Musa has described the rumour about the death of General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida over the weekend as unfortunate, mischievous and unholy.
He, however, said it is a call for the enactment of the social media regulation law championed by himself at the senate.
While reacting to the rumour, Senator Musa said in a statement he issued on Monday that “it is ridiculous for anyone to wish another human being death.
“Although death is inevitable for every human being, it is however not something to wish someone, not even one’s enemy. It is ridiculous, unthinkable and barbaric for anyone to wish another person death, especially someone of the caliber of General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, one of Nigeria’s legends still living.”
He recalled that in 2019 alone rumours about the ‘death’ of General Babangida has made the rounds more than four times, and wondered why anyone would engage in such act.
Accordingly, he said: “The question most people ask is, who is behind the rumour? Why would he or she engage in such act? What does he or she stand to gain? It is indeed baffling.”
