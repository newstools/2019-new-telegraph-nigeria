Over 100 aged women from Agubia in Ikwo Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, on Monday appeared half naked and marched  to Government House, Abakaliki the state capital to protest the arrest of their sons by security agents.
The women alleged that over nine of their sons have been arrested  by security agents allegedly acting on the orders of a top state government official from the area.
A  bloody clash had erupted between two rival groups in the area three weeks ago over which group controlled Agubia Motor Park in the community.  The motor park is the central park where all the vehicles
leaving and entering the community stop.
The incident  claimed the life of one Chinedu Nwali, and many others
injured, while houses, cars and other valuable properties worth millions of naira were damaged.
Six policemen deployed to the community to control the disturbances were abducted with their rifles and operational vehicles snatched from them. The abductors also stripped the policemen naked.
The policemen were later released following deployment of more armed
security agents. The incident may have led to indiscriminate arrest of some persons in the community.
