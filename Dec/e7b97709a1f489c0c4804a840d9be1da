Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has told his Manchester United players he is facing the sack if they lose their next two matches against Tottenham and Man City, according to reports. United are already facing a tough fight to secure Champions League football for next season as they are eight points behind fourth-placed Chelsea in the Premier League. And further pressure has been heaped on Solskjaer following another poor performance in the 2-2 draw at home to Aston Villa on Sunday, reports metro.co.uk. . Solskjaer’s position is under further threat following the availability of Mauricio Pochettino, who was sacked by Tottenham last month. And according to ‘The Sun’, Solskjaer has now warned his players that he could face the axe if they are beaten by both Spurs and Manchester City this week. United host Jose Mourinho’s side at Old Trafford on Wednesday before playing City at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday evening. A source at United told ‘The Sun’: “Ole was a little bit emotional and told them that if they don’t get two results this week, he could be gone. “Ole told the players all his and their focus now has to go straight to the Spurs game. “He was not being critical of Jose in any way but made it clear to the players just how much their old boss will want to win.”
