An elder statesman and the former governor of Osun State, Chief Adebisi Akande, yesterday noted that the consequence of some selfish Yoruba actions in the exile, who connived with their Northern and Eastern counterparts caused the disunity of the country and the promotion of religious conflict. Akande, the former interim National Chairman of the APC, disclosed this in a speech made available to journalists in Osogbo, after unveiling of Karele Oodua Logo and Investiture of Karele Oodua Ambassadors organised by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Culture and Tourism in the Osun State.  He argued that these actions dating back to the slave trade, pre-colonialism to the current democratic setting of Nigeria have culminated in the setback witnessed by the Yoruba people. Akande said: “The consequence of the actions of these Yoruba leaders in connivance with their Northern and Eastern counterparts metamorphosed into the disunity of the country and the promotion of religious conflict  which resulted in the migration of the Yoruba people to the Diaspora.” The former governor posited that the inactions of these selfish leaders have put the nation in a situation of economic imbroglio and massive exploitation of the nation’s commonwealth.  He said: “After the independence, for reasons of rank promotions, our leaders in military uniforms collaborated with the north to destabilise our political strength, to marginalise our people, to expropriate our patrimonies like the University of Ife, the Western Nigerian Television, the Liberty Stadium and to hound our elites and youths into graves and into exile for another layers of Yoruba in Diaspora.  “And they assisted in annulling Abiola’s election from the Presidency of Nigeria. Since the beginning of this Republic, the same leaders, for reasons of greed and self aggrandizement, cringed to the north and the East for political influence to continue to depress and degrade the authentic aspirations of the Yoruba people with a sermon that the Yoruba should join the mainstream politics of Nigeria.”
