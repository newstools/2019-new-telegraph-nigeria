A 30-year-old man, Narisu Musa, has told the police in Niger State that he did not know what compelled him to murder his seven-month-old daughter. Musa of Salka village in Magama Local Government Area was arrested for allegedly strangling his baby. During interrogation, the suspect admitted to have killed his daughter. He said: “I cannot explain how and why it happened. “I gave birth to my daughter out of wedlock and we are preparing for our wedding. I cannot explain why I took her life just like that. People will not believe me; it was like someone hypnotised me. It is very shameful to explain. “How am I going to explain to my wife what transpired? I think that is the end of the marriage; she will never forgive me. My friends, this time around, will desert me.” When asked whether he wanted to use the baby for ritual purposes, the suspect said “God forbid, Magama people don’t use their children for rituals and that is why I cannot explain how I killed my own daughter.”  The incident came a few months before Musa and mother of the baby tie the knot.  It was learnt that on May 20, 2019, the suspect took child, while the mother was sleeping, to at an uncompleted building and strangled her to death. Musa was reportedly trailed and apprehended by police operatives attached to the Nasko Division following a tip-off.  It was learnt that when the mother woke up and did not see her baby, she raised the alarm which prompted neighbours to report the matter to the police before the suspect was apprehended. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Muhammad Abubakar, said the suspect had confessed to the crime. He added that Musa would be charged to court after the conclusion of investigation.
