Plus sized Nollywood actress, Monalisa Stephen, has warned men to stop seeing ladies who are fat as only sex objects. Monalisa who on account of her size and physique get several overtures from the opposite sex advised men to quit seeing fat girls as sex objects. According to her, “Some of you see fat girls and you have nothing for them but to see them as a sexual object to warm you; that’s wrong. Fat girls are just human. Do not see them as a sex object or fetish. Some of you will even come and say, ‘send me your nude’; nude kill you there! If you really want a woman, then love her for whom and what she is, not trying to get to her so you can experience the rubbish fantasy you have in your head. Don’t tell me you want a fat girl or you love fat girls. Good for you, it’s none of my business. I’m not your play thing; I’m just a normal girl”, she blurted. In another post, Monalisa warned those who are thinking of committing suicide to think twice about the good things of life before taking such extreme action. According to the curvy actress, depressed people considering suicide as an option only need to think of two things: sex and food and they would probably change their minds on committing suicide. “Are you depressed and want to commit suicide? Wait a minute, just wait. Think about food and sex; oh my God, they are so sweet to just let go like that. No o, we die here o”, she suggested.
