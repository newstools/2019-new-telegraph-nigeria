Three people yesterday narrowly escaped death following the collapse of a storeybuilding at Shangisha, Magodo area of Lagos. The building, which is located at Kayode Aluko Olokun Close, was under construction when it caved in with three people trapped. The building was said to have collapsed about 3p.m., while workers were working on the structure. It was learnt that operatives of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) and other emergency responders, who rushed to the scene, rescued the trapped victims. A police source disclosed that the three people trapped in the building were rescued and taken to hospital. Between January and June, the state has recorded seven incidents of building collapse, with the loss of over 24 lives, including that of the pupils of Ohen Nursery and Primary School at Ita-Faji. Government said it had identified 149 distressed buildings, 40 of which were demolished in the past one year. It also said 38 structurally defective buildings had been earmarked for demolition, just as it lamented the activities of unscrupulous developers, which, it said, posed a lot of challenges to government.
