Italy booked their place in the Women’s World Cup quarter-finals with a goal in each half to beat China in Montpellier. Forward Valentina Giacinti gave Italy an early lead when she turned in the loose ball from close range after Peng Shimeng parried Elisa Bartoli’s effort. China enjoyed a resurgence before the interval but Italy sealed victory through Aurora Galli after half-time. Galli, who replaced Cristiana Girelli in the first half, found the bottom corner from outside the area.
Italy will play the Netherlands or Japan in the last eight on Saturday in Valenciennes. Le Azzurre dominated the early exchanges and Giacinti had a ninth-minute strike ruled out for offside before giving her side a deserved lead. Italy could have doubled their lead after the half-hour mark when winger Valentina Bergamaschi was played in over the top, but her fierce effort across goal was well saved by Shimeng.  That save from a keeper nicknamed the ‘Wall of China’ appeared to spark her side into life and they produced their first shot from inside the Italy area in the 41st minute and a further two before the break. Liu Shanshan also fired in a volley from outside the area which was well saved by Laura Giuliani. But Italy broke their resistance within five minutes of the restart as forward Galli picked up the ball the best part of 30 yards out and sent a right-footed shot past Shimeng and into the bottom corner.
