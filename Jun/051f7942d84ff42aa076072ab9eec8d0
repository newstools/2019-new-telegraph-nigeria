An Abuja High Court sitting in Maitama yesterday remanded in EFCC custody one Philomina Chieshe and five other officials of the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) over alleged complicity in the missing N35 million from sales of JAMB e-card in Benue. Chieshe was arraigned alongside Samuel Umoru, Yakubu Jekada, Daniel Agbo, Priscilla Ogunsola and Aliyu Yakubu after the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) filed eight criminal charges against them bordering on refusal to account for the board’s money between 2014 and 2016. The trial judge, Justice Peter Afen ordered that the defendants be remanded in the custody of EFCC pending the hearing and determination of their bail applications, consequently adjourning till Monday for the hearing of their bail applications. The prosecution in the eightcount charge, alleged that Chieshe, a sales clerk with JAMB, told their Registrar and his team that she could not account for the N36 million she made in previous years before the abolition of scratch cards. The antigraft agency further alleged that the first defendant claimed that the money was swallowed by a snake in Makurdi, Benue State. The defendant was quoted to have alleged that it was her housemaid that connived with another JAMB staff to “spiritually” steal the money from the vault in the accounts office through a snake. According to the prosecution, the offense contravened Section 139 (a) of the Penal Code Law but the defendants all pleaded not guilty to the charge when it was read to them. Prosecuting Counsel, Ekene Iheanacho, however, prayed the court to fix a date for commencement of trial and to remand the defendants in prison custody while also admitting receipt of the bail applications filled by counsel to defendants. He, however, informed the court that he had not gone through it because he was served in court.
