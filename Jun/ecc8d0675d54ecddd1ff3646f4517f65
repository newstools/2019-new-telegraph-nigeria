Popular Nollywood actor, Yul Edochie, has miraculously survived a major auto accident while on a trip to the East. He made this known through his Instagram account@yuledochie yesterday. “All I can say is thank you Lord, thank you Jesus, thank you Jehovah. God is real and God is alive. Thank you Blessed Mother Mary. I left Lagos ye s t e r d ay heading to the East, just before I got to Ore doing 100-120km, my car lost control and started veering off to the right. I tried to steer it back on track and the next thing I knew I was upside down, tumbling till the car finally ended up in a gutter,” the actor wrote. Edochie said that he miraculously came out alive with a few cuts and bruises. He further wrote: “I thank the Almighty God for his mercies, I thank our Blessed Mother Mary, and to all the Angels sent by God to protect me always, thank you. I also thank all my fans and friends all over the world who always pray for me and wish me well. God is alive. Life can end in a second. The money, the cars, the mansions, the fame, the good life, all vanity. Be close to God. God is everything.”
