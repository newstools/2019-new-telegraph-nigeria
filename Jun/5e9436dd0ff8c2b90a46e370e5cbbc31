A community, Amokwe ancient kingdom in Udi Local Government Area of Enugu State, has announced plan to recognise her indigenes who have lived 90 years and above as part of efforts to recognise longevity.  The proposed ceremony being packaged by Amokwe Development Foundation (ADF), a socio-cultural association made up of prominent personalities of the area residing in different parts of the world, will take place in December.  The Chairman, Educa-   tion and Empowerment Committee of ADF, Mr. John Kennedy Chime, disclosed this to journalists at the weekend during the 2019 annual Education and Human Capital Empowerment Programme for indigent citizens of the community held at Amokwe Town Hall. He said one of the objectives of the planned recognition and award for the nonagenarians and centenarians was to encourage the elders “to also tell us the history of Amokwe, Umuneke, Udi, Enugu State and anything they know about Nigeria and the world”.  According to him, every Amokwe citizen residing in Nigeria and other parts of the world “are expected to come back home for this recognition of citizens of the town that are 90 years and above which will take place in December this year”.  Chime said that aside the prizes that would be given to the awardees, the people would use the opportunity to encourage the elders to tell the younger ones how they came to be where they are.
