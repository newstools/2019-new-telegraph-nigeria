Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, yesterday said an encompassing strategy is being developed to reduce Boko Haram attacks in the state. The governor stated this in an interview with journalists in Damboa after he visited the town and surrounding communities to assess security situation in the areas. Zulum, who also visited the 25 Task Brigade at Damboa alongside Chief of Army Staff, Lt – Gen. Tukur Buratai, said he had met with President Muhammadu Buhari on the strategy with the chief of army staff also in attendance during the meetings. He, however, said the strategy would not be disclosed for security reason but added that “we shall include the traditional rulers. “We are now looking forward to ensure that strategies are developed through communities, community driven approach. “We have intimated the traditional rulers to strategise and ensure that a lot of information dissemination is being carried out.’’ Zulum also said the state would collaborate with the military to work out modality to ensure that terrorists, willing to surrender through the “Operation Safe Corridor’’ were re-integrated. “The most important thing is that military and government have to work out some modalities to ensure that those, who are willing to return (surrender), we shall look at the possibility of re-integrating them through the “Operation Safe Corridor.’’
