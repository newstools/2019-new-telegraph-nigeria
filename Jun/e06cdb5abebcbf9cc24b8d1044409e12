A former aide of the late Chief MKO Abiola, Lisa Olu Akerele, has said that naming National Stadium in Abuja after the late winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election was most appropriate given the late politician’s status as ‘Pillar of Sports in Africa’.
Akerele, in a statement yesterday, said the National Stadium is the best sporting monument to bear the name of the sport-loving late politician.
He said: “Naming the National Stadium after MKO Abiola is commendable.
“Apart from MKO’s legendary philanthropy, another area where he excelled was in the sporting arena which earned him the title of ‘Pillar of Sports in Africa’.
“President Muhammadu Buhari has truly proved himself as real ‘Daniel come to judgement’ by rewriting the historical roles played by MKO in almost all areas of national development which some misguided former military officers tried to rubbish in the past 25 years!”
