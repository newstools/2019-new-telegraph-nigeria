Wife of the founder of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA), Omodele Fatoyinbo, has said her husband is not a rapist. Speaking at the Abuja headquarters of the church on Sunday, the woman dismissed the allegation levelled against her husband by Busola, wife of Timi Dakolo, a Nigerian singer. Busola had said Biodun Fatoyinbo raped her as a teenager growing up in Ilorin, Kwara state. COZA started in the ancient town in 1999. But Omodele, also a senior pastor of the church, said it was untrue. She spoke while welcoming newcomers to the church. “My husband is not a rapist. Even if he was not a believer, he would not be a rapist,” she said. “If you are a first timer, this is the authentic COZA you’ve heard about. You can hug each other. If you are of same sex, please o, before they say we are giving women to men.” Some female members of the church also gave testimonies on how “God used Pastor Fatoyinbo” to transform their lives. The founder, who spoke briefly, announced the cancellation of the annual seven days programme of the church which would have started on Monday. Tagged “Seven Days of Glory”, influential preachers from the US, including TD Jakes, spoke at previous edition of the programme. Fatoyinbo said he took the decision as directed by the “Holy Spirit”. Protesters had stormed the church in Lagos and Abuja, asking the founder to step down.
