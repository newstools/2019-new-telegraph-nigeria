The camp loyal to the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Adams Oshiomhole in Edo State, yesterday said members of the camp would reconcile with the camp of Governor Godwin Obaseki on the governorship election holding next year on their terms. To this end, they rolled out conditions for reconciling with the governor ahead of the 2020 governorship election in the state.  Members of the major opposition group towards Obaseki’s re-election move, Edo Peoples Movement (EPM), yesterday vowed to see that its two major objectives of repositioning the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state and getting a replacement for Obaseki were achieved.  The group’s position was on the heels of a peace meeting initiated in Abuja between Obaseki and Oshiomhole, where it was gathered that the former governor expressed surprise over complaints of abandonment against Governor Obaseki by party members and leaders and he was said to have advised the governor to reach out to the aggrieved party members and leaders and make peace with them, as they were the ones who possess the power to nominate party’s governorship candidate.  Co-convener of EPM, Mr. Henry Idahagbon said: “Our position remains the same; we remain as constant as the northern star, whatever peace initiative we arrive at and is concluded in Abuja will remain in Abuja. Edo Peoples Movement will stick to its two cardinal objectives; first is to restructure the party by strengthening it, by returning the party to its old winning ways, an election winning machine. “The second is to shop for a suitable replacement for Governor Godwin Obaseki in 2020.  Those two motives are immutable, we stand with them and whatever peace move they make good for them, we don’t have any problem with any peace move, but the peace move will be without prejudice to the cardinal objectives of Edo Peoples Movement,” Idahagbon said.
