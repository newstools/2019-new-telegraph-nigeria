 The technical crew of the Super Eagles has had a big trouble deciding the first choice goalkeeper for the match against Burundi following the recovery of Ikechukwu Ezenwa. Daniel Akpeyi was in goal in the team’s first goal against Burundi because Ezenwa was injured. The Super Eagles Manager Gernot Rohr revealed that the Katsina United goalkeeper was fit again and available for selection. The coach noted that Akpeyi did not do badly against the Burundians and they now have a big decision to make regarding who will wear the gloves against the Guineans today. He also confirmed that Francis Uzoho is now the third choice goalkeeper. “Akpeyi started as number one against Burundi because Ezenwa had an injury in camp in Asaba and he (Akpeyi) did well in the friendlies. Uzoho is number three. Now that Ezenwa is back, we have a tough decision to make ahead of the game. Akpeyi performed well against Madagascar,” he said.
He is not worried about the injuries in his squad saying his side will cope. He said: “Ahmed Musa is fit to play and we are happy that the players are coming back to provide more competition. Players have come in and have done well. It shows that we are mentally strong. “Jamilu (Collins) got injured here, but the injury isn’t too serious and he should be fit to play on Sunday (against Madagascar). Abdullahi Shehu’s injury is a bit more serious and will keep him out for a longer period.”
