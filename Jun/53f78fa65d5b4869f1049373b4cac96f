Following the success of LuLu Lingerie, Nigeria’s first innerwear store for wholesale distribution and retailing of multi-brand underwear, sleepwear, and intimate apparel for men, women and children, Oluchi Orlandi has ventured into a new terrain with the launch of LuLu Panty Liners and LuLu Pads, these products are under the LuLu Personal Care portfolio. The vision is to provide young girls and women with a partner they can trust, that understands them, a product that is made by a woman for women to keep them feeling fresh, “oops” free and confident. In a recent Op-ed piece titled “I Am Woman”, Oluchi mentions the menstrual cycle as part of a woman’s superpower, but also acknowledges the vulnerability women feel when it occurs for the first time. Oluchi stressed that the pads and panty liners allow women to be their best selves at all times, it is about giving room to conversations surrounding femininity, building confidence, going on a journey of discovery together with young girls who are just coming into their own and also with older women who are in search of a larger purpose.
