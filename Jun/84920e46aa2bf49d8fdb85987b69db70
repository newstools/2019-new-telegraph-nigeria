Philip Abayomi had to overcome some stormy weather to emerge Group A winner in the ongoing Zenith Bank Next Generation Masters Championship taking place at the national stadium Tennis Centre.
Playing against Godgift Timibra of Rivers State, the defending champion from Lagos eked out the first set 7-6 but was then overrun by Timibra 6-2 in the second set to require a final set decider.
However, with both players showing visible signs of fatigue, it was Abayomi who had more in reserve to win the match 7-6, 2-6, 10-4 to top the group and avoid a tricky clash against Musa Mohammed, the Group B leader.
Unseeded Emmanuel Jebutu emerged from Group B as second best having beaten the No.4 seed Michael Osewa in the first match and Michael Ayoola in the final group match. Abayomi will take on Jebutu in one semifinal while Musa will face Timibra in the other.
In the girlsâ€™ round-robin group matches, Omolayo Bamidele from Ekiti and Olamide Aderemi from Ondo topped Groups A and B respectively. Bamidele will meet Jumai Mohammed from Lagos, runner-up in Group B while Omolade will fight for a spot in the final against Favour Moses from Kaduna.
The semifinal matches are slated to commence 10 am Friday while the finals will come up on Saturday starting 12 noon prompt.
