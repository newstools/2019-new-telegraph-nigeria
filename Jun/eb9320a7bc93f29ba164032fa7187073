Major world stock markets edged higher and the U.S. treasuries market resumed its recent rally on Wednesday, as investors bet that the U.S. Federal Reserve would cut interest rates and help boost a sluggish global economy. Underscoring concerns over growth was a report by U.S. payrolls processor ADP Wednesday that showed U.S. private employers added 27,000 jobs in May, well below economists’ expectations and the smallest monthly gain in more than nine years. According to Reuters News, a flare-up in trade tensions between the United States and China hurt world stocks in May and triggered fears of an impending recession. Yields on U.S. two-year Treasury notes – sensitive to traders’ view on changes in Fed policy – hit their lowest since December 2017 following the ADP data. The inversion between U.S. 3-month bill rates and 10-year yields continued for a ninth straight session. “The ADP number does raise some concerns about the further impact of tariffs. It adds to the case of interest rate cuts, the odds of that happening are going up,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. Comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and other Fed officials this week helped limit equity market losses as they warned the trade war may force them to respond, prompting investors to price in possible rate cuts. Interest rate futures show the U.S. central bank will start cutting rates as soon as next month, with as many as three rate cuts priced by year-end.
