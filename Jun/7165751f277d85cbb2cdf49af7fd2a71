The Islamic Development Bank (IDB)’s “AAA” credit rating has been affirmed with a “Stable Outlook” by Fitch Ratings, the Bank announced in a statement. According to the statement, the trust certificates issued by IDB Trust Services Ltd. have also been affirmed at ‘AAA’. “The ratings and the stable outlook reflect the intrinsic strengths of IDB; in particular, its excellent capitalization, excellent liquidity buffers, conservative risk management underpinned by strong risk management policies, and low solvency risks compared with other regional Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs). Fitch also recognized the IDB’s capitalization as being ‘among the highest for MDBs,’ the statement said.  The IDB remains amongst the most highly-rated MDBs and the highest in the Muslim world. The ‘AAA’ rating enhances the Bank’s capacity to mobilize external resources to fulfil its development mandate and play a leading role in development of Islamic Finance industry. President of the IDB Group, Dr. Bandar Hajjar, congratulated all member countries, IDB Board Members and staff on the achievement. He renewed the IDB’s commitment to exert maximum efforts to realize the objectives of the 2020G Vision and the ‘President’s 5-year Program’ (P5P) to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of the Bank’s activities.
