Youth leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Enugu State chapter, Mr. James Nwanjoku, at the weekend, narrowly escaped death after some gunmen opened fire on him. Nwanjoku, who is currently receiving treatment at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH), Ituku Ozalla, Enugu State, was shot on the head, while he was in his car, on the Enugu Port Harcourt Road. The state chapter of APC has condemned the attack on Nwanjoku, who is its youth leader in Enugu West Senatorial District. The party called on security agents to carry out thorough investigation into the attack with a view to unmasking those behind the shooting. The state Chairman of the party, Dr. Ben Nwoye, urged security operatives to ensure that, “those behind the barbaric act are arrested and brought to justice.” He said: “We want to call on security operatives to carry out thorough investigation into this ugly incident. This is not the first time our members would be attacked. If you recall, I narrowly escaped death by the whiskers last year, when unknown armed men invaded my Enugu residence. “They shot one of the policemen attached to me. He was seriously injured. The gunmen went away with the injured policeman’s rifle, and till date, the rifle has not been recovered. Our party is calling on the Enugu State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Suleiman Balarabe, to engineer a proper investigation into this latest attack, involving the Enugu West APC youth leader.” The victim, who is the son of former state Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Onyiaoha Nwajoku, now a traditional ruler in Aninri Local Government Area of Enugu State, has been a vocal voice of opposition in the state and local government area in particular. However, efforts to speak with the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Ebere Amarizu, on the matter failed.
