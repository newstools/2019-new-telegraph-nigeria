Scientists in the United States said that chronic exposure to ambient ozone may raise the risk of atherosclerosis and harm arterial health.
They made this known in a new study published in the journal ‘Environmental Health Perspectives’.
According to the findings smog, which largely consists of ambient ozone, may lead to atherosclerosis, a cardiovascular condition.
Atherosclerosis is the result of fatty deposits — such as cholesterol, fat, or cellular waste — accumulating inside a person’s arteries.
Over time, the buildup of plaque inside the blood vessels’ walls thickens the arteries, which restricts the blood, nutrients, and oxygen that would normally reach the rest of the body.
Atherosclerosis could lead to more dangerous cardiovascular events, such as coronary heart disease or peripheral artery disease, as well as a heart attack or stroke.
While researchers do not yet know what triggers atherosclerosis, factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and cigarette smoking are believed to cause much of the damage.
New research points the finger at another possible culprit: air pollution.
Lead author of the study Meng Wang, Ph.D., is an assistant professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the University at Buffalo School of Public Health and Health Professions in New York.
The research team followed 6,619 adults, who were 45–84 years old and who did not have cardiovascular disease or any other conditions at the start of the study and found an association between chronic ozone exposure and an “increased rate of carotid wall thickness progression and risk of new plaque formation.”
These results suggested arterial injury in the carotid arteries — the two large vessels that supply blood to the head and neck.
“This may indicate that the association between long-term exposure to ozone and cardiovascular mortality that has been observed in some studies is due to arterial injury and acceleration of atherosclerosis,” Wang stated.’
