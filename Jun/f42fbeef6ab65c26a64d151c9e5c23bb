 Two persons, Daniel Osagie and his sister-in-law, Unity, have been found dead in a well in Edo State. The bodies of the victims were discovered at Idunowina community in Ovia North East Local Government Area. The bodies were discovered after three days’ search by a team of relations, vigilantes and villagers. It was learnt that Osagie, a patent medicine dealer, left home with Unity after receiving a call from a yet-to-be-identified person but they never returned home. A boy reportedly found Osagie’s car in the bush which led to discovery of the bodies. The boy, whose name was not given, disclosed that the bodies of the victims were discovered after he saw his car inside the bush. Residents said over 10 persons had been killed in the community in the past five months following strange encounters. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Chidi Nwabuzor, confirmed the deaths. He said investigation had commenced to unravel the cause of the deaths. Nwabuzor added that the case was still a suspected murder until police investigation proofed otherwise.
