 Ex-International, Friday Ekpo, has advised out of favour Super Eagles striker, Kelechi Iheanacho, not to take his exclusion from the final team going to Egypt for this year’s Africa Cup of Nations as a setback, but another opportunity for him to revive his career.
The former junior international was dropped alongside Semi Ajayi by the Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, ahead of the final preparation for the championships in Egypt.
It has been a difficult time for the former Manchester City star, who has find it difficult to command a regular playing time at his current club, Leicester City in the English Premier League.
Speaking with New Telegraph, Ekpo said the players should look at the positives and move ahead with the determination of returning to the team better.
“I will say dropping of Iheanacho is to spur him to better days only if he can understand that,” Ekpo said.
“Money is good but it cannot buy you a place in a team. Iheanacho is a very fantastic player, but if he really wants to play football, he should look for a team where he will be able to play week-in-week-out and that will return his confidence and make him a better player.
“My prayer is for him to get back to his old self and return to the national team. I want him to correct his mistakes and not take the AFCON miss as a major setback but an opportunity for him to get back to his best.
“He has not been given much opportunity to play at Leicester, he should look for a place where he can play and ignore money for now because when you keep playing as a footballer, the bigger club will come for you.
“I am begging him to look for a place where he can get regular playing time and become what we knew him for.”
