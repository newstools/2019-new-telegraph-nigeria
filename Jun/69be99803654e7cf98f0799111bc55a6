 Bayelsa State Governor, Seriake Dickson, at the weekend hailed the pivotal role played by the leadership of the 5th session of the state House of Assembly in strengthening democratic principles. Governor Dickson made the remark at a special thanksgiving service in honour of the immediate past Majority Leader of the Assembly, Dr. Peter Akpe, at the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Yenagoa.  A statement by the governor’s Special Adviser on Media Relations, Fidelis Soriwei, quoted the governor as noting that for the past seven years, the executive and legislative arms of government had enjoyed a cordial and harmonious relationship, which had brought about significant growth in all spheres of development in the state.  Acknowledging the key role played by Akpe in the Assembly, the governor described him as a super lawmaker and bridge-builder, whose contributions on the floor of the House were exceptional. While unveiling a book authored by Akpe, titled; “The Valleys of Life: How To Come Out of Them,” Governor Dickson said the lawmaker had exhibited a high sense of duty, particularly during his second term in the House.  To this end, the governor promised to engage Akpe by bringing him on board the executive arm of government to continue to render service to the people. Governor Dickson, who noted that his government over the years recorded achievements that were unparalleled in the history of the state, assured the people that his contributions to politics and governance of Bayelsa would be chronicled for posterity to judge.
