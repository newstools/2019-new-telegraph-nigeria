Goods worth about N20m were yesterday destroyed by fire at the Orita- Aperin Market, Ibadan, Oyo State capital when fire gutted some sections, the cause of which was yet unknown as at the time of this report.  When Sunday Telegraph spoke with the Babaloja of Orita-Aperin Market, Chief Abiodun Hammed, he said “the fire started by 12:00 midnight on Friday, and we immediately called on Oyo State Fire Service but unfortunately, when they got here, the nozzle of their truck was not functioning, so we had to resolve to self help by putting out the fire ourselves, or else, the loss would have been more than this.   “Most of the owners of the shops affected by the fire just bought goods into their respective shops.  This was what makes the total value of the goods affected by the fire to be that much. “The shops affected included shop of a jewelry, food ingredient seller, provisions, red oil and herbs among others. Five million, six hundred thousand naira was the worth of jewelry that got burnt, and most of the goods affected in the shops of the herbs seller cannot be replaced because they were some ancient goods that cannot be replaced”, he recalled.  The market leader therefore appealed to the Oyo State government to come to their aid because the loss was too much for the victims to bear. One of the victims, whose shop was also affected by the fire, Latifat Adegbola, appealed to the State government to assist them financially because the money they borrowed money to buy the goods and it attracts interest.  “All my goods have been consumed by the fire and the remaining ones are useless. We are calling on the state government to come to our aid so that we can survive”, she appealed.  Also speaking to newsmen, a vegetable seller, Mariam Oladepo, who said she lost goods worth over one hundred thousand naira to the inferno, also said that her shop had been razed by the fire and nothing remained for her and her children to feed on again.
