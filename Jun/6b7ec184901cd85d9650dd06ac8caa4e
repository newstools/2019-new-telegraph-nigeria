To ensure justice, equity and fair play in power distribution among the three senatorial districts of Kwara State, a group under the aegis of Kwara South Consultative Forum (KSCF), has called on Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazak, to appoint most senior Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the Kwara State University, Malete (KWASU) as Acting Vice Chancellor, pending the appointment of a substantive officer. The substantive VC to be appointed, the group said, should come from either Kwara North or Kwara South because the outgoing VC, Prof. AbdulRasheed Na’Allah, who hails from Kwara Central, had spent 10 consecutive years on the post. The group decried lopsidedness in appointments to key positions in the university and other organisations in the state over the years, which they noted had been skewed in favour of Kwara Central to the detriment of the other two senatorial districts. Time to make a redress is now, said the group. Addressing journalists in Ilorin, the state capital, the group of elder statesmen, led by Chief Joseph Aderibigbe, who was the pioneer Secretary to the State Government (SSG), admonished indigenes of the three senatorial districts to live together in peace and allow fairness and the fear of God to guide their actions. The group said: “The Kwara central senatorial district should recognise that every district like every man has a right to be treated as a district equal in opportunity to be enjoyed and treated fairly, justly and equitably.”
