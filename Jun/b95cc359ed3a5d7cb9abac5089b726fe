Director General, Nigeria National Accreditation Service (NINAS), Mr. Celestine Okanya, has revealed that the 12m Euros Grant from the European Union (EU) provided a lifewire for Nigerian institutions, especially those ones that have the responsibility of accreditation in the country. Okanya, who disclosed this in Abuja during the celebration of this year’s United Nation’s World Accreditation Day, said the six-year grant had boosted the activities of the Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON), the Consumer Protection Council (CPC) and others to achieve five big components of quality infrastructure. He stated that Nigeria was joining the rest of the world in the celebration to underscore the role of accreditation in building strong and sustainable infrastructure that will meet global standard. According to him, Nigeria’s products have suffered rejection in the international market due to lack of coordinated and standard laboratories, but assured that such situations were been tackled with what NINAS was doing. He added: “To ensure that there is confidence and trust in the process of our quality assurance. The international community want us to be able to independent, very one involved in quality issues and conformity issues are doing their duty according to international standards. “First component was to strengthen the existing institutions like SON,CPC and those quality institutions. Strengthen them and build their capacity. And in that component they also created the quality award aimed at increasing our quality culture in our economy. “The second component was to create for Nigeria an accreditation body and it was from this funding that we created NINAS. Component three is another institution which is in charge of metrology that is everything you are measuring weight size volume.”
