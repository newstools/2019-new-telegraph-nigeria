Chris Ugwu writes that Veritas Kapital Assurance Plc., like any other insurance firm in the country, has continued to struggle with claims expenses and harsh operating environment  Though insurance sector is important for sustained economic growth because it deepens and broadens the domestic financial services and generates higher savings rates and greater economic development, it still struggles with challenges such as under capitalisation of existing industry players, dearth of appropriate human capital and professional skills, poor returns on capital, existence of too many fringe players and poor asset quality.  Other challenges include prominence of unethical practices, significant corporate governance issues, insurance premium flight, poor business infrastructural facilities, especially in the area of ICT, lack of innovation in product development, lack of awareness on the part of consumers on the uses/suitability of insurance products, low gross domestic product, GDP, per capita figures and poor corporate governance structures. Due to the stagnant growth of insurance industry, which has remained a key challenge in the country, the realities are that insurance companies will continue to struggle to find their feet as one of the major financial service sectors in Nigeria.
According to experts, what this means is that for the insurance industry to thrive and attain its potentials, the government must be sincere in promoting a favourable environment that will allow the financial service industries thrive. This will help to increase the operational efficiency of the insurance industry.  Veritas Kapital Assurance Plc. (formally Unity Kapital Assurance Plc.) is one of the underwriting firms that has got fair share from the dislocation of the economy and the insurance sub-sector; the company is among the insurance firms that have dropped below par value in share price due to dwindling fortune in financials following investors’ low sentiments. The insurer, which began the 2017 financial year on the decline territory, finished the year 2017 in a loss position. The insurance firm also began the 2018 financial year on the downswing with a record of 45.51 per cent decrease in net earnings during the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Following massive decline in key performance indicators, the firm, which was unable to weather the storm, also finished the second half year 2018 with a drop of 73.21 per cent for the six months ended June 30, 2018, a drop of 54.1 per cent for the nine months ended September 2018 and slipped into loss position during the full year ended December 31, 2018. However the firm began the 2019 financial year with a glimpse of hope, but market watchers doubt the sustainability.
This is despite that Veritas Capital had acquired the majority share in the company after the firm and Unity Bank had in 2016 executed a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement (SSPA) detailing the terms and conditions of the acquisition of 50.3 per cent equity stake in the company. Like most of its peers in the industry Veritas Kapital Plc.’s share price on the Nigerian Stock Exchange has dropped below previous floor price of 50 kobo following the amended pricing methodology and par value rules of the Nigerian Stock Exchange which specified that the price of every share listed on the Exchange shall be determined by the market forces. Following negative sentiments that have enveloped the demand of most insurance stocks, the share price which stood at 29 kobo per share in June 2018 dropped to 20 kobo per share when the closing bell rang on Friday, representing a decline of 9 kobo or 31 per cent year-to-date.  Financials  The challenges of operating environment became tougher during the financial year ended 2017, resulting in the insurance firm slipping into loss position.

Loss before tax stood at N558.605 million from pretax profit of N408.911 million a year earlier. Management expenses increased by 38.27 per cent from N1.500 billion in 2016 to N2.074 billion reported in 2017. Gross premium written stood at N2.411 billion in 2017 from N2.110 billion posted in 2016, representing an increase of 14.26 per cent while net underwritten income came in with N1.840 billion from N1.644 billion in 2016, accounting for an increase of 11.92 per cent.
The insurance firm posted 45.51 per cent decrease in net earnings during the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, to N100.712 million from profit after tax N199.481 million in 2017.

In a filing from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) the group’s pre-tax profit also dropped by 60.72 per cent from N257.530 million during the previous year to N101.160 million during the period under review.
However, gross premium written stood at N2.679 billion as against N2.035 billion reported in 2017, accounting for a growth of 31.64 per cent. The company finished the financial year ended December 31,2018, with a loss after tax of N695.252 million from N700.642 million recorded in 2017.

However, respite seemed to have come for investors of the company following 26 per cent growth in profit after tax the company posted during the first quarter of the year ended March 2019. The insurance firm reported a profit after tax of N127.081 million for the first quarter ended March 2019 as against N100.712 million posted in 2018. However gross premium written was down by 41 per cent from N1.228 billion in 2018 to N720.527 million reported in 2019.   Going forward Domestically, Mr. Thomas Etuh, Chairman, Veritas Kapital Assurance Plc., at the 41st Annual General Meeting of the company, said Nigeria’s economy had taken off to a great start in 2018. Oil price increased to about $80 per barrel (highest since 2015), foreign reserves increased to $47 billion as at July, 2018 (highest since 2014) and inflation rate dropped to 14.3 per cent (lowest since July 2016). “It is pertinent to note that the hitherto high level of insecurity and insurgency that predominated previous years has partially eased. In summary, the outlook for the operating environment remains positive, though guided, as 2018 is a pre-election year with associated political risks. “Notwithstanding, the capacity of the company to continue to do business on a long-term basis remains solid. We are very much aware of the task ahead of us and prepare to become more productive, smarter and more rigorous in dealing with necessary changes.
“Our strategic focus continues to lean on sustainable growth while we improve on our delivery channels through digital adoption. “Learning from the past, we have taken deliberate steps to improve risk management framework and corporate governance. We are now in the right position to deliver comparable performance for 2018 and beyond,” he said. Speaking at the unveiling/rebranding ceremony of the firm in Abuja, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Veritas Kapital, Polycarp Didam, said the company had surpassed the Federal Government’s capitalisation requirement for operators in the sector. He said: “Veritas Kapital has strong fundamentals, one of which is a robust shareholders’ fund. I had earlier emphasised on the requirement in terms of capitalisation for players in this sector. For our own business, it is supposed to be N3 billion. But as we speak, the shareholders’ fund in Veritas is in excess of N10 billion. “So, what this means is that even if we want to be a composite company, we have already surpassed the requirement as stipulated by the law. And this is part of the total restructuring that we started in August last year, which aims at adding value to what we deliver to the public.”  Last line Inadequate awareness on the part of people about the benefits of insurance and the inability of insurers to introduce innovative and market-driven products has remained the major impediments to the growth of insurance business in Nigeria.
However, insurance companies must also find ways to sensitise the populace about the use of insurance. Government also has a role to play in this by making relevant laws that will help make certain insurance policies compulsory and harsh sanctions for non-compliance of same.
