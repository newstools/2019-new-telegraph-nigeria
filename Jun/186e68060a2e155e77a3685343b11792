There was jubilation in Minna, the Niger State capital yesterday as the Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja dismissed an appeal filed by Governor Abubakar Sani Bello challenging the ruling of the election petitions tribunal in the state. The Court of Appeal on Monday held that; “In making this judgement, I have considered section 285 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the case of Governor of Ekiti State vs Olubunmi, and Akeredolu’s and hereby dismiss this appeal as it lacks merit.” The Court of Appeal also awarded the cost of N400, 000 to the 1st and 2nd defendant, Umar Nasko and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The appeal was challenging the tribunal’s decision suspending its ruling on the application to strike out PDP and Umar Nasko’s petition against Abubakar Sani Bello and two others. It will be recalled that the Federal High Court sitting in Minna, presided over by Justice Aminu Aliyu, had in March 2019, dismissed a case of certificate forgery against the governor. While speaking with our Correspondent in Minna, Director of Communications, Umar Nasko Governorship Campaign Organisation, Alhaji Yahaya Mohammed Usman said: “We are happy because, this will further boost our chances. There will be fair hearing and for now we will not pre-empt the court.” Other supporters who were seen screaming, ‘Sai Nasko’, ‘Power belongs to God’, ‘Niger must be liberated’ and so on drove straight to the Umar Nasko Campaign office, but the PDP governorship candidate was not available as at the time of filing this report. A PDP stalwart, who Mohammed Abdullahi Koko said: “I am very happy about this and I expect that the tribunal will uphold the substantive suit with the quantum of evidence available before them.”
