The much-awaited 2019 African Cup of Nations campaign will be kicking off on Friday at the Cairo International Stadium in Cairo with the opening clash set to take place between Zimbabwe and the cup hosts, Egypt. The home side, who lost out to Cameroon in the final of the previous edition, will be heading into the campaign eager to redeem themselves. All eyes and hopes will be resting on the country’s talisman Mohammed Salah, who helped end Liverpool’s 13 year wait for European glory. Zimbabwe, on the other hand, will be heading into the tie on Friday, on the back of a 1-1 draw against Tanzania in their recent fixture and will have their work cut out for them when they take on the dominant Egyptians. Their hopes of progressing past the group stages are likely to depend on the rest of their fixtures, which will be against Uganda and DR Congo respectively. Egypt are almost certain to walk away with the win and the three points that come with it, when the teams meet on Friday for the opening match of highly anticipated 2019 African Cup of Nations in Egypt. The hosts have certainly made quite a name for themselves in the tournament’s history, having won the cup for a record seven times. The home side are also impressive at home, with five out five wins in their last five home matches. The visitors do not seem capable of causing an upset whatsoever and a comfortable win for the hosts is definitely in the cards. The home side have also managed to score three goals or more in their last five home matches, which is a reason to believe that the hosts are likely to kick start their campaign with a couple in their opening clash on Friday.
