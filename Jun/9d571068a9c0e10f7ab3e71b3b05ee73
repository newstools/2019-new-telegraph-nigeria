Cameroon’s squad arrived in Egypt for the Africa Cup of Nations late on Saturday after delaying their departure over a pay dispute, risking possible sanction.  They touched down in Cairo at around 11 p.m. local time, to be greeted by a small group of supporters, some 24 hours behind schedule. The squad had refused to embark for Egypt on Thursday, calling for their fee to be doubled for appearing at the tournament, which they won two years ago.  But they later agreed to travel without any promise of more money. The Cameroon football federation said each player was paid a qualification bonus of 20 million CFA francs ($34,693) and would be given 5 million CFA francs after winning a first game at the tournament. In a letter signed by all the players, they said most had paid their own air tickets to the team’s pre-tournament training camps in Madrid and Doha, reports the BBC.
