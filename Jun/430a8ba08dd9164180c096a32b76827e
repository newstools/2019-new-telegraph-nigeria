Proprietor of Blessed Martins International Institute of Science and Technology (BMIIST), Ohataekwe, Ikwo Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, Chinedu Ogah, has raised the alarm over growing migration of children to other states for greener pastures.
He said many youths in the state had relocated to other cities to seek menial jobs such as hawking and wheelbarrow pushing, which he described as worrisome.
Ogah, who bared his feelings in an address during the maiden matriculation of 217 students of the institute, said the development had reduced the people of the state to nothing compared to their counterparts who could not ordinarily be measured to Ebonyi people.
He said: “The constant migration of our young students to cities of the country to do menial jobs has blackmailed the entire Abakaliki region as a clan who depends on hawking, digging of septic tanks, and wheelbarrow pushing for survival.
“It is our expectation that the school would provide such individuals the opportunity of redefining their future and erase the mentality and bad impression on our people, especially here in Ikwo.
“Therefore, the institute, being the first private higher institution in Ikwo Local Government Area, is positioned to entrench social norms and values in our children and prepare them in all ramifications to compete favourably with others in the society.
