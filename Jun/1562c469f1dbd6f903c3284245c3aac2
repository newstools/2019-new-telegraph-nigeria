The news of the attack on Mr. Augustine Mnyim by armed Fulani militants on January 3, last year took the people of his community by surprise. When the militia herders laid siege on the community and caught up with him at a close range, they get hold of him.  Already in their hands, the invaders drew their swords and cut his head. Blood gushed out, he became unconscious and they abandoned him in the bush where he laid for a whole day without help.  They left him for dead as he bled as a result of the deep cut which they inflicted on him. But with the mercies of the Almighty God, he cheated death, and managed with the blood stains and deep injuries to find his way home.  When the pictures first came up, many doubting Thomases thought it was Photoshopping. Once the news and photos of Mr. Augustine reached Governor Samuel Ortom, he immediately facilitated his treatment at the Wellington Clinic in Abuja. Mr. Mnyim was discharged on 26th February, 2018 and has been recuperating very well.   The family of Mnyim is grateful to God and Governor Ortom for saving one of them. They are also expressing their appreciation to Dr. Aondowase Joseph Ngbea, the Personal Physician to the governor for his assistance.  Mnyim, who is married with children, recalled his experience in the hands of the killers. He said when the insurgents struck, in January when 73 other persons were massacred, he was running out of his community in Guma Local Government Area to save his life when he ran into the invaders who pounced on him and inflicted injuries on him. “They wounded me on my head and left me dead, they ran away, but thank God, my life was spared . Today I am alive to thank God Almighty”.  “I must also appreciate the efforts of Governor Samuel Ortom, who is instrumental to my survival. I thank him so much and appeal to him to do same to other people irrespective of tribe or religion provided that person resides in Benue State”.
