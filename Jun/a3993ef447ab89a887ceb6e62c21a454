Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State has taken steps to end cultism and the gangland-style attacks which has plagued the state university at Anyigba for some time now. The Governor is said to be quite displeased with the blatant manner cult groups now attack one another, commit robberies and other crimes, and put innocent students and other members of the university and host communities in danger. In a statement released by his Chief Press Secretary, Onogwu Muhammed, Governor Bello, who is also Visitor to the university, has therefore approved that Major M. M Adama (Rtd) who has served for over a decade as the Chief Security Coordinator of the institution be immediately replaced with Mr. Aurelius Yusuf Adejo. Other security measures to arrest the situation and bring perpetrators to book will be rolled out in the coming days. Mr. Adejoh is a retired policeman and SARS commander who is very familiar with the security profile of the university town and its environs. He is expected to build on the legacies of his predecessor while bringing new ideas and approaches to quell the danger posed to the school by cultists and other criminals within the KSU community. The Governor, according to the statement, is determined to make sure that the Kogi State University, Anyigba enjoys the full benefits of his reforms in the institution, especially a predictable academic calendar and improved human and instructional resources. It will be recalled that late in July of 2017 the current administration in Kogi State proscribed activities of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) in KSU to eliminate strikes and other forms of industrial actions which tend to delay projected time of graduation for students. The new security measures are expected to help the institution consolidate on those gains.
