Hired pro-pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo protesters have stormed the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, Abuja in solidarity of the Pastor who is under fire for alleged rape and other sexual transgressions. The counter-protesters, who are mostly Muslim youths, were quickly assembled to disrupt the womenâ€™s protest. They were armed with a placard bearing different inscriptions that countered the allegations of the women protesters. Some of the counter-protesters admitted to having collected money and hard substances to join in the protest. While many of them turned their placards upside down, others confessed not to know the reason for the counteraction. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_20190630_101026-1.jpg?resize=520%2C292&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="520" height="292" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-223392" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_20190630_101026-1.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w, https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_20190630_101026-1.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" data-recalc-dims="1"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_20190630_101027-1.jpg?resize=520%2C292&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="520" height="292" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-223393" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_20190630_101027-1.jpg?w=520&amp;ssl=1 520w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_20190630_101027-1.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" data-recalc-dims="1"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_20190630_101114.jpg?resize=500%2C375&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="500" height="375" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-223394" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_20190630_101114.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_20190630_101114.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-recalc-dims="1"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_20190630_101027.jpg?resize=740%2C416&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="740" height="416" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-223389" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_20190630_101027.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_20190630_101027.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_20190630_101027.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_20190630_101027.jpg?w=1480&amp;ssl=1 1480w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" data-recalc-dims="1">
