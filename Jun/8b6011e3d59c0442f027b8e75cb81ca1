The National Agency for the Prohibition of Traffic in Persons (NAPTIP), has expressed willingness to strengthen its relationship with the Nigeria Armed Forces in the fight against human trafficking in the country.
Director General, (NAPTIP), Dame Julie Okah – Donli, disclosed this when she led her team on a courtesy visit to the Chief of Defence Staff, General Abayomi Gabriel Olonisakin, at the Defence Headquarters, Abuja.
Dame Okah–Donli said the collaboration between NAPTIP and the various security agencies would effectively combat the menace of human trafficking and unlawful exploitation of children in the country.
She said that the partnership was even more important in communities currently experiencing insurgency in the North Eastern part of the country.
Okah-Donli noted that the Nigerian military constitutes a strong ally alongside other stakeholders in the collaboration to rid the country of child trafficking. She also sought the cooperation of the security agencies in the protection of victims of human trafficking, describing them as vulnerable children and women who are engaged in dehumanizing and exploitative employment and usage by unscrupulous persons and groups.
In response, Olonisakin commended NAPTIP for the achievements recorded since its inception, particularly in the areas of awareness and sensitisation campaigns, rescue of child trafficking victims and prosecution of human trafficking offenders. The CDS lauded the DG’s zeal at ensuring the actualization of the Agency’s mandate.
Olonisakin, who was represented by the Chief of Defence Policy and Plans, Air Vice Marshal Nurudeen Balogun, assured the Agency of the military’s continuous cooperation in curbing the menace of human trafficking in the country.
