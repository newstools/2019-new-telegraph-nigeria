Wayne Rooney has urged Manchester United to resist the temptation to target world superstars such as Cristiano Ronaldo or Gareth Bale because he fears it could prove a huge waste of money. The Red Devils are in the early stages of a new era under the leadership of manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and have been linked with a host of established top-tier players. They are eager to rival neighbours Manchester City, who have pulled away to become the leading side in the Premier League, while United failed even to qualify for next season’s Champions League. And with arch-rivals Liverpool becoming European champions only last week, United are longing to bring back their own glory days and improve substantially on their sixth-place finish in the top flight in 2018-19. Record scorer Rooney says his old club should be patient, however, and build for long-term success at home and in Europe rather than plot a quick and expensive fix. Speaking on BBC Five Live’s Sportsweek show, Rooney said: “For Ole, the first thing he’s got to do is try and build the squad. I don’t think bringing one or two players in for over £100million is going to really help with the squad and with the players who are there. “I think he needs to try and look at maybe five or six players who have got potential to be top players but you’re not spending £120-130m on these players. “I think you’re spending £30-40m and then you’re trying to improve them, which will also give you longevity out of the players and allow you to build a squad around the five or six new players who come in plus a few of the players who are still there.”
