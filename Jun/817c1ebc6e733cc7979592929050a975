The organising committee of the Third Governor Seriake Dickson Football Tournament otherwise known as the Restoration Cup has moved the draw ceremony of the 2019 edition to Thursday, June 27.
The draws were initially scheduled to take place on Tuesday, June 18.. The Tournament Director, Mr. Daniel Alabrah, told journalists in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital, that the shift was necessitated by the huge interest the competition had attracted among communities, religious organisations and higher institutions across the state. He said more than 150 teams had already registered and that the request for participation forms had not stopped. “We have been inundated with a high request for participation in this year’s competition. More communities than we had last year have registered for the 2019 edition and we are still receiving requests from teams that want to participate. “We are encouraged by the interest that the Restoration Cup has elicited among communities in the state. We believe it is the result of the hugely successful tournament we had last year. So, the interest has soared. “We are compelled to extend the registration deadline in order to accommodate more teams and communities. Registration and submission of forms will now close on Saturday, June 22,” Alabrah said.
