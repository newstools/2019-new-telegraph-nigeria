 Fimo Ore Foundation yesterday donated clothes, food and medical to over 50 children. This was to mark the fourth edition of Fimo Ore Foundation’s Dress an African Child with the theme: “More Than Enough.”
The event, which took place at Church Street, Ikosi-Ketu, witnessed the foundation donating new clothes to over 50 children present, while also giving free medical treatment and food. The convener and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Fimo Ore, Mrs. Brenda Funsho-Samuel, said they were actually fulfilling the word of God that “compels all to show love to our neighbours”. She said: “We are after the total well-being of an African child and to do that, you have to clothe, feed and provide for their health through proper medication. The motive is to build their self-confidence because a child lacking in self-esteem or confidence might find it difficult to excel in school or relate with his or her mates. “What we do during the event is to give free clothes, free health care to all the children and their parents. During our last event, we had medical personnel from Lagos State Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, and we tagged the event ‘More Than Enough’ because our God is more than enough. “Apart from that, we also provide employment for people because yearly we produce over 1,000 clothes and we have people working directly with the foundation.”
One of the parents, who spoke with New Telegraph, Mrs. Mary Kingsley, said the organisation had shown love like Jesus commanded in the Bible.
She added: “The truth is that not everyone can afford a new cloth and for them to have come around to do this is a great thing. They have met the need of the children and their parents both physically and spiritually. Others must follow and do same.”
The next edition of the programme will come up later in the year.
