The speaker of the Edo state House of Assembly, Hon. Frank Okiye, yesterday swore in two additional members to swell the ranks of inaugurated lawmakers to 11 presently in the house. The legislators cut short their long adjournment date of July 17 to bring on board the two new members-elect, Hon. Emmanuel Okoduwa representing Esan North East II and Hon. Sunny Ojiezele representing Esan South East. It will be recalled that nine out of the 24 members elected under the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) were on Monday last week inaugurated by the Clerk of the state Assembly, Alhaji Audi Yahaya Omogbai. Hon. Okiye emerged as Speaker while Yekini Idiaye (Akoko Edo 1) was elected the Deputy Speaker. The house later adjourned sitting to July 17 shortly after the inauguration which raised dust among stakeholders following the absence of 15 lawmakers-elect at the inauguration. The absent member-elect had insisted they were not informed about the late night inauguration held amid heavy presence of security operatives. Okiye urged the two lawmakers to be good ambassadors of their constituencies and congratulated them for completing their documentation. “We cut short our break because some members have concluded their documentation. This was done to show to the world that nobody is being shut out. “Nobody was shut out. Anybody or group that completes his documentation in line with extant rules will be sworn-in”.
