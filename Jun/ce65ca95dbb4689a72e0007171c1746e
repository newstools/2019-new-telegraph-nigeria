Tantalizers has remained in the woods following increasing operational costs and competitions, Chris Ugwu writes   Nigeria’s hospitality industry is faced with multiple challenges ranging from poor energy supply and insecurity to misconstrued internal perception, poor customer service and little or no standardisation in operations. Others include inconsistent regulatory environment and skilled labour shortages caused by a few entrepreneurs with little knowledge of the workings of the industry who hijack the process to perpetuate plans for their own personal selfish gains.  Made worse is the infrastructure deficiency, which has inevitably transferred the high production cost to consumers and resulted to less patronage, thereby shrinking the operator’s profit margins. Tantalizers Plc, the only listed fast food company on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), has been struggling like any other fast food firms in Nigeria due to harsh operating environment. This is because the economy generally is faced with enormous socio-economic challenges. The company’s activities have definitely impacted on a negative note, majorly due to the increase in tariff, double taxation, depreciation in naira and the continued insecurity prevailing in some parts of the country, a situation that has compelled a scaling back of its expansion drive in those regions. Given headwinds such as weak demand on the back of household income, most consumer goods companies in Nigeria have continued to find it difficult to weather the storm. The effect of challenges in operating environment on the economy continued to impact adversely on its operations due to reduction in credit opportunities, increase in cost of sales and administrative expenses, which in turn affected the company’s income.  Tantalizers, which returned to profitability in 2017 after being in the red, started the year 2018 on the negative, as it slipped back to loss position in the first quarter of the year 2018 ended March 31 and remained in the red through the second and third quarters of the year, safe for the full year 2018 audited account, which saw the company’s profit after tax decline by 81per cent. Market analysts majorly attributed the company’s inability to get out of the woods to weak consumer demands, stiffer competition and increased administrative cost, which have resulted in slow growth of the company. The share price of Tantalizer, which closed at 36 kobo as at June 30, 2018, had dropped by 16 kobo or 44.4 per cent to close at 20 kobo per share as at May 31, 2019.  Financials Tantalizer had ended the financial year of 2017 on the positive note, recording improvement in overall performance compared to some couple of years ago in spite of the economic challenges. Overall systems revenue grew by 3 per cent to N3.74 billion, while the Company’s revenue of N1.75 billion was 10 per cent lower than 2016 due to retro-franchising and inadequate working capital according to the company. The Profit Before Tax of N450.6 million in 2017 was better than the 2016 pre-tax loss of N1.01 billion. This improved performance, however, came from improvement in other Income activities with profit on disposal of property, as a major component. The company’s result released on the NSE showed that its earnings per share grew to 14 kobo from a loss of 32 kobo in 2016. Cost of sales went down to N1.18 billion from N1.27 billion, leading to decline in its gross profit to N567.95 million as against N674.69 million. Tantalizers loan book reduced by about N1.1 billion in the period under review. The company reported that it repaid loans of about N862 million and serviced the interest of about N269 million only. It also secured a loan write back amounting to N600 million. According to reports, market analysts believe that with revenues still stunted and competition seemingly on the increase, Tantalizers might continue to sell down assets in a bid to fix its balance sheet. They added that raising capital is also inevitable and this will likely only be achieved via a strategic investor or a takeover of the company. However, the company returned to loss position in the first quarter of 2018 ended March 31, with a loss of N122.197 million as against a loss of N115.988 billion reported in 2017, accounting for a percentage change of 5.35 per cent.

The company’s revenue dropped by 23.14 per cent from N400.352 million as against N307.714 million posted in 2019.

Company’s ordeal/outlook Dr. Jaiye Oyedotun, Chairman, Board of Directors at the 20th Annual General Meeting (AGM), said unemployment and underemployment situation in the country worsened in 2017 with job losses and the increasing number of young people graduating with no visible plan for their employment. This had a negative impact on standard of living and purchasing power of the populace, he noted. This and the poor security situation in some parts of the country resulted in lower traffic, patronage and invariably profitability of businesses. “In line with our franchising focus, three corporate outlets were retro-franchised in 2017,” he explained. “This exercise though led to a reduction in our revenue, as their performance cannot be declared under corporate performance, the impact on our profitability is positive. Four new franchise stores were opened in Ogun, Lagos and Delta States.” “We could not explore to the fullest the opportunities that abound in Supply Chain and the bakery lines of our business because of our low working capital position. This working capital challenge slowed down our plan for growth/expansion and store remodeling. The need to conclude on the equity investor search becomes more critical than ever before. We are now using a multidimensional approach to aggressively tackle this major challenge of the company.” Besides, he said significant efforts have been made to dispose-off nonoperational assets in a bid to augment the working capital of the company. “The proceeds of such have been used to pay off the dollar denominated IFC loan,” he said. “ Efforts will be made to significantly pay down the local loans using such proceeds to reduce our finance costs and overall debt position.  “The need to sustain the profitability of the company remains our primary objective for 2018. We must grow corporate revenue to cover our costs. This we will achieve through opening of new stores as well as remodeling / retro-fitting existing stores to improve attractiveness. “We will continue to work on menu recipe revamp while improving the quality of our product offerings. Our search for equity investment we believe will be concluded this year, with the improvement in the Nigerian economic environment. In the interim, we will continue to boost our working capital through non-strategic assets disposal.  He said the Divisionalisation project, which kicked-off fully at the beginning of this year is making the major income generating units of the company more efficient in the day-to-day running of the business. “We believe the working capital inadequacy, which is a major challenge to the project will soon be resolved,” he assured.  “Our franchising programme is on course and we will open more franchise stores in 2018. We will leverage on partnerships with various organizations that will make prospective franchisees invest with lower costs, achieve faster set up time and be more profitable. We will continue to push for stores in virgin territories where we are not presently represented.”   Last line Though high cost of operations have remarkably weighed down on the hospitality sector in the country, the company should also intensify its marketing strategy in order to reach new customers whilst retaining old ones.
