A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja yesterday adjourned till June 27, a fresh suit filed by Senator Buruji Kashamu against the Federal Government, seeking to stop his extradition to the United States of America for trial in an alleged hard drug trafficking in America. The trial judge, Justice Okon Abang, fixed the date following the absence of the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) or his legal representation in court. The suit is one of the three new cases instituted by the senator, who is praying for an order of the court to prohibit the Federal Government from giving effect to the extradition request of the American government on him. When the matter came up on yesterday, counsel to Kashamu, John Olusola Odubela SAN, informed the judge that the matter which bothers on fundamental human right of the senator was for hearing and that he was surprised that the AGF was not in Court and was not represented by a lawyer. However, counsel to the National Drug law Enforcement Agency, Pius Gande, told the court that the case was transferred from Justice Ahmed Mohammed to the new court and that the AGF was not notified of the transfer and was not issued with hearing notice. Gande argued that the issue of hearing notice was fundamental and that the court should endeavour to indulge the AGF to be served with hearing notice to enable his presence or legal representation in court. He specifically said that the principle of fair hearing would be breached if the court should go ahead in hearing the matter in the absence of the AGF who is the first respondent in the suit. The NDLEA counsel submitted that the bottom line of the absence of the AGF was that he was not aware that the matter had been slated for hearing yesterday.
