As controversy continues to trail the decision by President Mohammadu Buhari to establish Ruga Settlements in parts of Benue State, the caretaker chairman of Otukpo local government area of the state, Chief George Alli yesterday led hundreds of youths in a peaceful protest to kick against the move. Otukpo, which is the homestead of former Senate President, David Mark, is one of the three local governments pencilled down by the President Mohammadu Buhari government for the location of the Fulani settlement. Specifically, the project is bid to be cited in Otobi-Akpa community in the local government. Other local government areas affected are Ukum and Tarka, home of former Senate Minority Leader, Senator George Akume. The youths carried different placards with bold inscriptions: “Benue rejects Ruga settlements”, “Benue youths reject Fulani occupation in any disguise”, “we are farmers and don’t have land for cow business”, “Ortom, defend us again”, among others. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/65279990_2341634419229687_8695477881381322752_n.jpg?resize=740%2C555&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="740" height="555" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-222529" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/65279990_2341634419229687_8695477881381322752_n.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/65279990_2341634419229687_8695477881381322752_n.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/65279990_2341634419229687_8695477881381322752_n.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" data-recalc-dims="1"> Also joined in the protest were the traditional rulers, women and children. The protest was carried out simultaneously with another in Makurdi, the state capital where hundreds of other aggrieved youths from Ukum and Tarka defied the heavy downpour in protest against Fulani settlement in their communities. Addressing the youths, Chief Alli
condemned the move in totality, saying “there is no way you can use our land for such a thing without our consent”. “We will abide by the Land Use Act of the government which stipulates that it’s only the state government that has the right to allocate lands to whoever it pleases. The locals are holding that land in trust for the government”. “The signpost that was mounted days ago was done without the knowledge of the people and the state government, and I don’t see where somebody will come to your community and mount a signpost claiming ownership of land without the knowledge of the government”. I have gotten the protest letter from the traditional rulers and I am going to forward it to the relevant authority,” he added. Chief Abel Egaji Abinya who spoke on behalf of the Akweya people who are the original occupants of the land said “we have no land to lease for ranching or grazing. We have given lands to the Federal government for the Dam project, Federal University of Health Sciences, Federal Government College, Crop Research Institute but this one (Ruga Settlement) we won’t accept”. “We the people of Benue have suffered enough in the hands of Fulani herdsmen and for that, we will not compromise”. “We will make sure we fish out whoever mounted that RUGA signpost without our consent”, he added. Similarly, leader of the Makurdi protesters, Comrade Orngu-Angu who defiled the early morning heavy rainfall, marched through major streets of Makurdi with placards and chanted songs against settlements for herdsmen. Some of the placards read: “No land for Ruga”, “We don’t want killer herdsmen”, “Call on the Federal Government to stop the policy”. Addressing reporters at the gate of Government House, Makurdi, Comrade Orngu- Angu said Benue people would not allow settlements for herdsmen. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/65145241_2341634555896340_7931609641320972288_n.jpg?resize=720%2C960&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="720" height="960" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-222528" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/65145241_2341634555896340_7931609641320972288_n.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/65145241_2341634555896340_7931609641320972288_n.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-recalc-dims="1"> <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/65383386_2341634619229667_4437293149160734720_n.jpg?resize=740%2C447&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="740" height="447" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-222530" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/65383386_2341634619229667_4437293149160734720_n.jpg?w=861&amp;ssl=1 861w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/65383386_2341634619229667_4437293149160734720_n.jpg?resize=300%2C181&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/65383386_2341634619229667_4437293149160734720_n.jpg?resize=768%2C464&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" data-recalc-dims="1"> <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/65394023_2341634482563014_4013220263175913472_n.jpg?resize=740%2C555&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="740" height="555" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-222531" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/65394023_2341634482563014_4013220263175913472_n.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/65394023_2341634482563014_4013220263175913472_n.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/65394023_2341634482563014_4013220263175913472_n.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" data-recalc-dims="1">
