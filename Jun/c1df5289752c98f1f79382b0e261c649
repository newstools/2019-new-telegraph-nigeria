Hon. Umar Mohammed Bago, who contested the speakership of the House of Representatives against Femi Gbajabiamila last Tuesday, has congratulated the Speaker and his deputy, Ahmed Idris Wase, on their victory during parliamentary elections. The Niger State-born lawmaker, who lost to Gbajabiamila, sent the message yesterday in a statement signed by his campaign spokesperson, Hon. Adam Ogene, while promising to work with the new leadership. “For us, it was a friendly contest to deepen our democracy and propagate the gospel of unity. Members on June 11, 2019 eventually made their choice and as loyal party men, we will have to respect and live with that. “We, therefore, formally congratulate the Speaker, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila and the Deputy Speaker, Idris Wase, on their elections.” “While wishing them well, we hereby pledge the support of our principal, Rt. Hon. Mohammed Umaru Bago to work with them and give all the support they would need from him to evolve and pursue populist and people-oriented policies and programmes for the good of the House and Nigerians at large. “Bago shall be glad to lend his vision to the entire House leadership to also enable our great party, the APC and the government of President Muhammadu Buhari realise its Next Level agenda for the country’s 9th National Assembly. “On behalf of the Mohammed Umaru Bago Campaign Organisation, we wish to convey our profound gratitude to the 360 members of the House of Representatives for their kind support during the race for the Speakership.”
