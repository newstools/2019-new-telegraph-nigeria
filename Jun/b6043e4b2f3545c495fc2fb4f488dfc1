The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Benue State yesterday took a swipe at the defeated governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2019 general election, Emmanuel Jime, over his comments that he would floor Governor Samuel Ortom at the tribunal to recover what he termed his ‘stolen mandate.’ The PDP said Jime, his party and APC supporters were drifting away from reality in their delusion that he had a good case at the courts and would soon be installed governor of the state. State Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Mr. Bemgba Iortyom, in a statement released to the media in Makurdi, said the false belief by the APC was that the second term mandate being enjoyed by Govermor Ortom was a stolen one. The party regretted that while the governor together with his leaders, including the state Chairman, Sir John Ngbede, Senator David Mark, Senator Gabriel Torwua Suswam, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, Abba Moro, Senator Emmanuel Yisa Orker Jev and others, were traversing the length and breadth of the state combing for votes right down to the grassroots, Jime and his political godfather, Senator George Akume and the Benue APC were content to wait for ‘federal might’ to merely announce victory in their favour on the day of election and install Jime as governor.
