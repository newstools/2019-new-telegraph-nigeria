Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has announced the commencement of fresh Operation Green Sweep 2 in the North-East, aimed at targeting “selected locations” of suspected terrorists in the region.
The NAF Director of Public Relations and Information (DOPRI), Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, said this in a statement.
He said: “The Nigerian Air Force (NAF), through the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation Lafiya Dole, has launched Operation Green Sweep 2 against terrorists in the North-East of the country.
“The Air Interdiction Operation, which commenced on Wednesday, 26 June 2019, will target selected locations within the North-East in order to further degrade the remnants of the terrorists as well as deny them safe havens and freedom of action.
“In the morning of day one of the operation, air strikes by NAF aircraft resulted in the obliteration of an Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) tactical headquarters and neutralisation of several terrorists at Kollaram in northern Borno State.
“The attack was executed following series of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions, that showed the presence of a significant number of ISWAP fighters in buildings under trees spread across the settlement along with communication facilities with roof-mounted solar panels, defensive parapets around the settlement as well as suspected tunnels at various locations.” “Consequently, the ATF dispatched two NAF Alpha Jet aircraft to attack the location, recording accurate hits in the target area, leading to the destruction of some of the structures and equipment as well as the killing of several terrorists.”
