Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Sokoto zonal office, has secured the interim forfeiture of N60 million cash linked to a former Secretary to the Zamfara State Government, Prof. Abdullahi Muhammad Shinkafi, and Murtala Muhammad Shinkafi. On June 17, Justice Fadima Murtala of the Federal High Court, sitting in Gusau, Zamfara State, granted the order for the interim forfeiture of the said sum.
