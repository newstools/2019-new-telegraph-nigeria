S&P Global Ratings has said that the recent wave of bank mergers in the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is nearing an end unless operating environment initiates more bank consolidations. According to the agency, the current wave of bank mergers and acquisitions in the region is being driven by the desire among banks with the same major shareholders to further enhance efficiency, strengthen franchises and boost pricing power. S&P stated that given the overbanked nature of some GCC banking systems, further consolidation could help improve banksâ€™ performance and financial stability hence a new wave of M&A motivated by purely economic reasons could follow, but it may take longer to be realised. The Gulf region is heavily over-banked and lenders are being forced to merge as they seek to stay competitive in an era of lower oil prices. The UAE has 49 commercial banks serving a population of about nine million, while Oman has 20 banks serving a population of about 4.7 million.
