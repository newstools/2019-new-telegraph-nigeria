Ghana’s ambassador to the Peoples Republic of China, Edward Boateng, has stressed the critical role Africans in the Diaspora can contribute in the building of Africa as a global giant. Speaking to participants at the Forum for African Diaspora in China as part of events marking the 56th Anniversary of Africa Day, Ambassador Boateng called on Africans in the Diaspora to support the ongoing transformation agenda being championed by Africans on the continent and added that all developed nations attained their feet with the support of citizens who returned with knowledge, skills, experiences and ideas acquired from other countries. Referencing statistics from development agencies, Boateng stated that if remittances from the diaspora to sub Saharan Africa was $46billion in 2018; higher than aid to an extent and excluding valuation of their skills and knowledge, the diaspora had a critical role to play in Africa’s growth. He juxtaposed Africa’s growth trajectory to that of China and asserted that even though there were differences in certain areas, both sides shared similar history and values such as the power of social relationships and deep cultural sense. He stated: “There are so many strategies we can learn and modify to suit our individual development paths from China’s 40 years of opening up and development agenda. The lifting of over 500million people from poverty, giant strides in digital economy amongst others have lessons to be learnt, compared with what we have on the continent and with solutions from nations, devise tailored made solutions viable within an African context”. He was however quick to add that the Africa-China comparisons must be done tactfully because where as China is a country, Africa is a continent with 54 sovereign countries each having its political system, governance, history and culture. That notwithstanding, initiatives such as the African Continental Free Trade Agreement can minimize the barriers if well implemented.
