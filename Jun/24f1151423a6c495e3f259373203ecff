Police have arrested a suspected armed robber for allegedly collecting N20,000 from a doughnut seller at gunpoint at Ijede area of Lagos. The suspect, Sodiq Rasaq, was arrested by officials of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) on Thursday about 5a.m. at Ijede, Ikorodu area. Rasaq’s alleged accomplice, Quadri Yusuph, is still at large. The RRS officials also arrested a 32-year-old man, Peter Abah, on Mobolaji Johnson Road, Ikeja, for stealing electric cables. After robbing the doughnut seller, the suspects stabbed him twice in his hands when he was resisting them from. The suspects were said to have fled after the operation. The victim, Ogbodo Chibuike, said the suspects who rode on motorbike stopped him that they wanted to buy doughnuts about 5a.m. According to him, because they were his age mates, he didn’t suspect they might rob him. He said: “They bought N200 doughnuts from me. I was waiting for them to pay me, but they didn’t. It was then I challenged them that they would not leave if they didn’t pay me. Before I knew what was happening, they alighted from their motorbike and stabbed me. They then stole my wallet containing N20,000.  “After they stabbed me, I immediately raised the alarm. It was my noise that attracted passers-by but most of them couldn’t chase the suspects because they were on motorbike. It was the RRS operatives that went after them and one of them was caught at Ijede Junction, while the other escaped.” It was learnt that the second suspect, Abah, came out from Badagry Prison in December 2018, after being convicted for stealing solar panels. The former convict was said to have told the police that his two accomplices were at large. He said: “Three of us cut the electric cable before we removed it from the transformer. I was just unlucky. My colleagues who escaped were Godwin and Zuma.”
