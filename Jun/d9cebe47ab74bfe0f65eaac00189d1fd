 Further hearing in a suit filed by MTN Nigeria Communication Ltd. to challenge the N242 billion and $1.3 billion import duties and withholding tax imposed on it by the Federal Government will resume on 29th October, 2019, at a Federal High Court in Lagos.
The suit, which was earlier fixed for trial yesterday by Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke could not proceed owing to the absence of a witness for the Attorney General of the Federation (the sole respondent in the matter).
AGF’s lawyer, T. A. Mokolu, informed the judge that the witness had some challenges appearing in court.
He added that the lead counsel, Tijani Gazali, was also held up in Abuja.
Mokolu subsequently sought for an adjournment till a later date.
Responding, MTN’s lawyer, Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN) said though he is not opposed to the adjournment request, it will surely constitute a drawback to the suit.
After listening to submission of parties, Justice Aneke adjourned the matter to 29th and 31st October, 2019 for trial.
The judge had, at the last hearing of the matter on 7th May, 2019, dismissed the preliminary objection of the Attorney General of the Federation to the suit.
In his ruling, Justice Aneke faulted arguments by AGF that the suit was filed out of time.
MTN instituted the suit by a writ dated 10th September 2018, to challenge the legality of AGF’s assessment of its import duties, withholding of tax and value added tax in the sums of N242 billion and $1.3 billion. In the suit, MTN claimed that a revenue assets investigation carried out by the Federal Government on it for the period of 2007–2017 violates Section 36 of the Constitution.
It added that government’s decision, conveyed through the office of the AGF, by a letter dated 20th August 2018, also contravened the constitutional provisions.
The telecoms company is also claiming N3 billion as general damages, exemplary damages and legal costs against the AGF.
