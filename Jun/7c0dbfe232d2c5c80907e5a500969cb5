Oasis Medspa, owned by the ravishing celebrity, Freda Francis, has scored another first by introducing two state-of-the-art equipment: DermaLux for ‘skin rejuvenation’ & ‘ThermiVa for Vaginal Rejuvenation’. She unveiled the world-class facility on May 31, 2019 and since then the spot has become a beehive of activities for topflight ladies and gentlemen across industries. She spoke to Lanre Odunkoya  What is ThermiVa? ThermiVa is a non-surgical procedure for labia and vaginal tightening and rejuvenation. ThermiVa is a form of energy medicine that uses heat therapy delivered via radio frequency (RF) waves to promote collagen synthesis, shrinkage and tightening of female tissues. Most women suffer from incontinence, orgasmic dysfunction, prolapse, vaginal laxity, and/or vaginal dryness as a result of childbirth or a change in hormone status. They seek and want an intelligent comfortable choice for their female needs. ThermiVa is the first non-surgical and thermal-controlled radio frequency procedure to relieve symptoms associated with female gynecological conditions.  What are the benefits of ThermiVa? Vaginal (internal) tightening: ThermiVa tightens the vagina at the opening of the full length of the vagina reducing laxity that is noticeable to patient and partner. ThermiVa will tighten the external labial tissues and reduce sagging or lax skin. It results in noticeably softer and smoother skin. Patients experience more comfort in tight clothing and less self-consciousness in yoga pants and bikinis. ThermiVa adds collagen and elasticity which results in softer and thicker skin and normalizes moisture both internally and externally. For those experiencing Vaginal/Vulvar Dryness or Atrophic Vaginitis, ThermiVa makes daily life and sexual intercourse more comfortable. ThermiVa also helps patients experience reduced accidents and leakage and even urge symptoms after treatment with ThermiVa. Women diagnosed with mild to moderate stress incontinence (Stage II) may benefit from the procedure and avoid the need for surgical options. Another benefit is Increased Sexual Satisfaction. Patients can expect increased vaginal sensitivity, more coordinated and stronger muscular contractions, and ability to achieve stronger orgasms in a shorter time period.  How does ThermiVa work? ThermiVa non-surgical vaginal rejuvenation delivers controlled thermal energy to the desired areas – external (labia) and/or internal (vagina). Applying heat to tissue has become the standard for promoting collagen remodeling, which helps strengthen the structural support columns and improve the integrity of the skin. ThermiVa encourages new, tighter collagen production and improved coordination of muscle activity and strength.  How long does the treatment take? The ThermiVa procedure takes approximately 30-40 minutes in the office. 20 minutes internally and 20 minutes externally.  How many treatments will one need? The complete ThermiVa procedure includes 3 separate treatments completed one month apart. There is no downtime and no anesthetics are required. Patients are comfortable, relaxed and very pleased with the noticeable results.  How much does it actually cost to do the procedure? It’s actually N600,000 only but we would slash the price by half for a few weeks to encourage our patients. Many may say the amount is on the high side, but what is your marriage worth for instance. We’ve come to realise how much stressed couples become when sex is no longer pleasurable. After childbirth, most men complain they no longer enjoy sex. Wouldn’t you rather save your marriage with a N600,000 procedure? Is your marriage not worth a lot more? When you go for surgery for virginal tightening, how much do you think you’re going to spend? This saves marriages because when you’re not satisfied at home, you’d seek an affair outside. No side effect. It’s non-invasive and each treatment is just about 15minutes.  Is the procedure painful? ThermiVa is pain-free and requires no downtime recovery. Patients can resume regular activity and sexual function on the same day. ThermiVa treatments are gentle, relaxing and feel like an internal, warm massage.  What about the results, how soon will one get it? I can assure you that it’s immediately   Would you actually say that your facility is worldclass? By the grace of God we’ve brought in doctors from the United States and whey they got here, they marveled at what they saw. The ambiance was what they couldn’t believe to be from this part of the world.  What other forms of medical aesthetics do you do? Well, ours is a premium skincare clinic and a luxury day spa. This is because we also do other services like massages, IV vitamin drips, laser hair removal and we also do consultations here for plastic surgery. So, we fly in plastic surgeons once every two months. They do face-lift, breast augmentation and so on.
