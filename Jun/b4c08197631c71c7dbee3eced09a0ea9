 Shell Nigeria Gas (SNG) has increased its gas distribution capacity by over 150 per cent.
Managing Director, SNG, Ed Ubong, said this at the recent media launch of the 2019 edition of the Shell in Nigeria Briefing Notes, an annual publication detailing the activities of the business interests of the global energy giant in Nigeria.
He said this was due to the safe completion of its second gas train, the Agbara-Ota Capacity Increase Project, which enables the company and its partners to achieve regular gas supply to subscribed industries in Ogun state.
“Apart from increasing the distribution capacity in existing states where it operates, SNG is maturing opportunities to expand its gas distribution network to new states,” he said.
“On completion of its expansion projects, over 1,000 megawatts equivalent of energy will be directly supplied to various industrial parks and manufacturing companies in Nigeria.”
The completed first phase of its pipeline expansion in Abia State is connecting manufacturing industries in the Osisioma area directly to pipeline gas.
It will also deliver pipeline gas to the IPP consortium that provides electricity to the popular Ariaria market in Abia State – one of the largest open stall markets in West Africa, with over 37,000 shops.
The 1st Phase of the Ariaria IPP project commissioned by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2019 currently provides electricity to over 4,000 shops.
Ubong said: “Shell as a leading energy company is committed to supporting the Federal government’s aspiration to grow the domestic gas market, making domestic infrastructure investments under the right commercial conditions and continuing to birth domestic gas projects that will be major game-changers in Nigeria’s quest for cleaner energy sufficiency, industrialisation and economic growth.
