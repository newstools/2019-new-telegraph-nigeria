The Librarians Registration Council of Nigeria (LRCN) has called on all academic and research institutions in the country to digitilise their research outputs and store in their repositories.
LRCN Registrar/CEO, Prof. Michael Afolabi, who made the call at the opening of the workshop on ‘Preservation of eResources: Models and Modalities,’ organised by the council at Bayero University, Kano (BUK), Kano State, noted that the move was to ensure the continued availability of the resources and their use by future generations.
He explained that with the advent of new technologies, digitilisation of worthwhile materials should be undertaken at the institutions’ level and efforts should be made to archive as well as preserve the electronic resources for future use.
According to him, all information generated within an organisation could be digitised using open source software like Greenstone, Dspace and others. He added that the preservation of these resources had become very necessary and as significant as their acquisition.
“There have been a few global initiatives to ensure preservation of electronic resources. There is therefore the need for all academic and research institutions in Nigeria to digitilise their research outputs and develops a pool of institutional digital repositories across the country.
“Libraries have a responsibility to preserve, conserve and restore resources in printed, microform, machine-readable, audio, or video formats. The primary objective of preservation of electronic information resources is the need to prolong the life of non-printed materials,” he said.
