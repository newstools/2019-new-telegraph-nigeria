Former Abia State Governor and Senator-elect for Abia North, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu has commended Senator Danjuma Goje for dropping his Senate presidency ambition after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari.
Goje, who has declared his support for Senate Ahmed Lawan, was applauded by Kalu for his patriotic and matured decision in the interest of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Nigeria at large.
According to the Senator-elect, the President’s intervention is timely, appropriate and highly commendable.
Speaking with a cross section of APC supporters in Lagos yesterday, Kalu, who is contesting for the position of Deputy Senate President, stressed that the coast is clear for Lawan and him (Kalu) to emerge as Senate President and Deputy Senate President respectively.
He said: “I salute President Buhari for meeting with the trio of Governor Nasir el-Rufai, Senators Ahmed Lawan and Danjuma Goje in the interest of the APC and Nigeria at large.
“The decision of Senator Goje to drop his Senate presidency ambition in order to support Senator Lawan is a welcome development.
“I am optimistic that Senator Lawan and myself have the capacity to steer the affairs of the red chamber.”
Kalu, while urging the President to wade into the cold war between the National Chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and his predecessor, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, called on the members of the soon-to-be inaugurated 9th National Assembly to place national interest above selfish ambitions.
