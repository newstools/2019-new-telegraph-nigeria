An Ikeja Special offences court, Lagos, convicted a self-acclaimed MTN Marketer Floria Ubani, who defrauded some MTN customers in the tune of N34 million. Ubani, who was arrested in 2013, had already spent six years in prison custody before being convicted on charges bothering on fraud, stealing and issuance of dud cheque. The 41-year-old woman was found guilty and convicted for defrauding some customers of MTN in the sum of over N34 million. The Lagos state government had slammed a 12 count charge of fraud against Ubani but she was convicted on 6 counts and freed on 4 counts. The presiding judge, Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo convicted her for the offence of fraud which stipulated a 3 years jail term, although she had already served that period of punishment in prison custody. According to Justice Taiwo, the offences to which the defendant was arraigned contravened Section 419 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State and Federal Laws, and stipulated a three years prison sentence as punishment. The judge, however, released her from prison custody, having spent more than the required sentence upon conviction while in custody. Justice Taiwo said, “The defendant is free to go. She has already spent six and a half years custody without an imprisonment order and the offence attracts a three years prison sentence which she has already served”. Meanwhile, Ubani was accused of obtaining over 34 million naira from one Charles Obi, 4 million from Ariyo Abiodun and few other victims with the promise of selling fairly used goods from MTN, on the claims that she is a major distributor of MTN. The convict thereafter offered goods like transformers, generator sets etc to the victims for sale. She, however, failed to produce the goods as at when due, couldn’t refund her clients, and later absconded until she was arrested. The convict had also claimed to be the owner of a company, G&N Integrated Service, located at 166 Ijesha Road, Surulere area of Lagos state.
