Ebonyi State Government yesterday directed residents of Igweledoha Ngbo community in Ohaukwu local government area of the state to withdraw a suit filed against their Okoffia counterparts, Ohaukwu local government area of the state within one week with a view to resolving boundary dispute among them.
The two communities have been at war over boundary matters with farm crops and economic trees including human lives been destroyed by the day.
This, however, prompted Igweledeoha residents to approach the court over the contentious boundary dispute.
But the state government yesterday directed them to withdraw the matter on or before Monday to enable it resolved the crisis.
Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Dr. Kenneth Ugbala said this at a meeting with the warring groups at cabinet office, Government, Abakaliki while adopting a decision by chairmen of the two local governments.
The chairmen, Clement Odah(Ohaukwu) and Chinyere Nwogbaga (Ebonyi) had canvassed that
there should be a clear boundary demarcation between the two communities so as to end the crisis.
However, Ugbala said “you have inter-married. Many daughters of Igweledeoha are living at
Okoffia as wives just like many Okoffia daughters are living in Igweledeoha also as wives. So, what are we struggling for because everything about land end in 6fit.
“While we are getting old and waiting for our six fits, let us learn how to live in peace with our brothers and sisters.
“The government has directed that the matter in the court over the land dispute should be withdrawn between now and Monday next week because it will give us the opportunity to achieve lasting peace.
“The two council Chairmen have done well in their efforts to bring peace and they have made our work very easy through their recommendations.”
