Worried by the security situation in the country, the Police have deployed specially-trained dogs to railway stations nationwide. Addressing officers and personnel during the formal deployment of the K9 component of Operation Puff Adder at the Force Headquarters in Abuja, yesterday, the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mr. Mohammed Adamu, said the initiative was to ensure crime prevention and detection along railway corridors.
According to the IGP, the sniffer dogs are trained to detect Improvised Explosives Devices (IEDs), narcotics and other illicit drugs, firearms as well as other prohibited items. “The deployment of special breed and exceptionally-trained police dogs for security duties is as old as human civilization. Hence, their utilization in combating crimes and sundry internal security threats in the 21st century cannot be over emphasized. Indeed, K9 are known to possess extra-ordinary capacity for detection of IEDs, narcotics and other illicit drugs, firearms and other prohibited items which criminals usually engage for the perfection of their criminal activities. “The deployment of Police dogs is, therefore, meant for detection or prevention crimes along the railway corridors. Their brief shall be for patrols, surveillance, detection and apprehension of felons in and around railway facilities,” Adamu said.
He assured of the success of the initiative, noting that the K9 section of the force has a track record of crowd control and management of civil disorder. “Our plan is to maximize our unique K9 strength to complement other sections that have been deployed as part of the broad policing architecture which we recently emplaced towards addressing our internal security challenges. “With this initiative, passengers, staff, and indeed, all the citizens of this country can further be re-assured of their security as they patronize the services of the Nigerian Railway Corporation,” he said.
