Scientists in the United States (US) have warned that falling asleep with the light or Television (TV) on could lead to obesity, saying that it confuses the body clock. The findings, published in the journal ‘Jama International Medicine,’ found light – especially sleeping with a light or television on in the room – increased the risk of weight gain and obesity. They consequently advised people to avoid looking at bright screens beginning two to three hours before bed. According to the study, by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, North Carolina in the US, reducing exposure to artificial light at night while sleeping could be considered in obesity prevention interventions. The authors said compared to those not exposed to artificial light, women who slept with the light or TV on were 22 per cent more likely to become newly overweight and 33 per cent more likely to become newly obese. In addition, they said this could be because a lack of sleep changed the hormones that regulate appetite. Sleep disruption, the team said, has an effect on hormone balance, and could make affected persons seek out calorific food. The research included nearly 44,000 women aged between 35 and 74 years of age, that had no history of cancer or cardiovascular disease and weren’t shift workers, daytime sleepers or pregnant at the study’s start. The study participants self-reported the amount of artificial light they were exposed to at night. The researchers, led by Dr. Yong-Moon Mark Park, were quick to point out that exposure to artificial light at night could be reflective of unhealthy behaviours, such as an unhealthy diet, sedentary lifestyle or stress, and socioeconomic disadvantage.
