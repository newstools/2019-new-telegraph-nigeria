 There were indication at the weekend that the rift between Governor Ganduje of Kano State and the Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, would soon be a thing of the past as the Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote has reportedly succeeded in brokering peace between the two. Sunday Telegraph learnt that it was sequel to this that Governor Ganduje exchanged Sallah pleasantries the Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II during the recent Eid-Mubarak, an indication that the governor might have soft-pedalled on the planned probe of Sanusi’s activities as the Emir. Aliko Dangote has been trying since the beginning of the crisis sometimes in 2018 to sees a permanent reconciliation between the two with the business mogul allegedly doling out N100 million to the State Assembly to suspend all negative actions on the monarch.
However, things got messier with the Governor opening yet another probe on a certain N3.4billion emirate allegedly squandered by the revered royal father.  But with the persistent intervention of Dangote, the two leaders met yesterday night in Abuja, congratulating each other for the successful completion of the month of Ramadan Fast and the Sallah festive period. Both leaders spoke jointly to all Muslims and urged them to continue with the good teachings and spirit of the fasting period of the Month of Ramadhan.  Emir Sanusi seized the opportunity to congratulate Governor Ganduje for his victory at the recent governorship election. He further wished him a successful second tenure in office from 2019 to 2023. For healthier relationship between the state government and Kano Emirate, Sunday Telegraph learnt that the dialogue would continue to bring about a complete reconciliation of the two Kano leaders.
