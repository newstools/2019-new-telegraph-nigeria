Some members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Osun State are now poised for war against the leadership of the party in the state for purportedly expelling three of its members; Awosiyan Olalekan Kingsley, Ojetade Thomas and Awodire Sina Peter, despite a court order restraining the party. Counsel to the three members, Barrister Olufemi Ayandokun, said the party’s decision is an assault on the judicial system, arguing that the expulsion of the trio was a calculated attempt to foist a situation of helplessness on the court, where the suspension is being challenged. “It came to us therefore as a rude shock to hear the news making the rounds and orchestrated by a statement signed by Bola Ajao, Osun State Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party that Messrs Awosiyan Olalekan Kingsley, Ojetade Thomas and Awodire Sina Peter who are members of the Peoples Democratic Party in Osun State have been expelled. “It cannot be overemphasized that law remains a valid tool for regulating human affairs in order to achieve a sane society. Court is put in place in a civilized anddemocratic society as ours to forestall resort to self-help in the resolution of disputes which are bound to occur given human interaction. “For reasons of clarification, we state that Messrs Awosiyan Olalekan Kingsley, Ojetade Thomas and Awodire Sina Peter who are members of the Peoples Democratic Party in Osun State are our clients who briefed us on the 30th day of November, 2018 to file an action at the Osogbo High Court seeking an Order of Court setting aside their purported suspension. “On the 3rd day of December, 2018 we filed Suit No. HOS/M.165/2018 at the Osun State High Court Osogbo challenging the purported suspension of our clients from the membership of the Peoples Democratic Party and sought an Order of Court setting aside the said suspension.”
