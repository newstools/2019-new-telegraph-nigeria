Super Eagles forward, Henry Onyekuru is preferably seeking for regular game time rather than a big club move. The Galatasaray pacey forward has been on the radar of some top European teams following his impressive displays this season just ended. However, reports from from Turkey and France have it that Galatasaray and Olympique Marseille are set to rival favourite suitors Bayern Munich for the 22-year- old forward. The Everton loanee has however insisted he remains committed to getting regular playing time if he probably joins any interested team. His current team Galatasaray will be hoping to make his loan spell permanent but that will not be an easy deal to pull off given the growing interests on Onyekuru. The former Eupen star has seven international caps to his name, but will now be looking to impress further at the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt after making the final 23-man list.
