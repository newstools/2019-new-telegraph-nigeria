Osun State House of Assembly yesterday elected Hon. Timothy Owoeye, the lawmaker representing Ilesa East Constituency as its seventh speaker. Owoeye did not have any opposition for his emergence as the speaker of the Assembly which was inaugurated by Governor Gboyega Oyetola. Before his emergence, Owoeye had served as the majority leader of the fifth and sixth Assemblies during the last administration led by Hon. Najeem Salam, the immediate past speaker. Owoeye was said to have the backing of prominent politicians in the state like the former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Adebisi Akande, Governor Oyetola and the immediate past Governor Rauf Aregbesola, immediate past Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Alhaji Ajibola Basiru, Hon. Bola Ilori, the state incumbent chairman of the APC, Prince Gboyega Famoodu, and a host of others. Resolution on his adoption as the speaker was unanimously agreed by these notable politicians at a meeting held at the residence of Chief Akande in Ila-Orangun. Sources at the meeting disclosed that it took them several hours of deliberations before arriving at a decision that Owoeye was the best candidate to steer the ship of the Assembly.
