 Nigeria Ambassador to Egypt, Dandatti Abdulkadir, has charged the Super Eagles to go for the title at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations expected to kick-off on Friday June 21 in Egypt.
Abdulkadir urged the players and officials of the team to strive to be worthy representatives of the country while fighting for her pride during the 32nd AFCON.
The message was presented to the Nigeria camp at the Hotel Mercure in Ismailia on Wednesday, through senior officials of the Nigeria Embassy in Egypt who represented His Excellency.
“The President and good people of Nigeria are looking up to you to fight hard for the country’s pride and honour at the Africa Cup of Nations,” he said.
“This tournament is the biggest-ever in the history of the competition and a great performance from you will do well for the nation’s image and our stature in world football.”
Professor Abdulkadir, who is presently in Nigeria, was represented by top embassy officials Ahmed Muhammed Gusau (who led the team), as well as Mrs Hauwa Kucheli, Muhammed Garba, Uneke Emerald and Ahmed Abdulrahman.
In response, the coach of the team, Gernot Rohr, and captain, Mikel Obi, promised that the team would give its best in the championship.
The Super Eagles have been training twice a day since arriving in Ismailia on Monday, and are looking forward to Sunday’s final pre-AFCON friendly against Senegal’s Teranga Lions in Ismailia.
Officials confirmed to thenff.com on Thursday that both Nigeria and Senegal camps have agreed Sunday’s duel will be played behind closed doors.
