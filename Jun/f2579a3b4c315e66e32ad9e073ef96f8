The Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) has described the suspension of the broadcast licence of Daar Communications Plc by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) for alleged violation of its code signals as the final descent into full blown dictatorship in Nigeria.
Lead Director, Centre for Social Justice, Eze Onyekpere, said that for a regulator to apply the ultimate decision to close a network television, two radio stations and satellite services at the same time questions the competence and capacity of the regulator.
Onyekpere, a lawyer, argued that regulation should be done by independent experts or technocrats and not partisan persons who have an interest beyond the security and welfare of Nigerians.
“Media regulation cannot be the task for men and women who do not understand and recognise the role of a free press in a democratic society.
“Nigerians must rise up to condemn the reintroduction of Decree 4 (Public Officers Protection against False Accusation Decree) which failed in Buhari’s first incarnation in 1984/85. It is imperative to recall that truth was no defence under the Decree. To consider that we are in 2019 makes this closure absurd, provocative, insensitive and primitive .
“All who laboured for democracy must stand up to condemn this gross violation of our collective rights to be informed and to express ourselves within the confines of the guarantees of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended).
This kind of closure did not happen under Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo, Umaru Yar’Adua and Goodluck Jonathan.
“We can start the struggle against dictatorship or sit idly until the dictatorship engulfs all of us,” Onyekpere said.
Daar Communications operates the Africa Independent Television, Ray Power FM, Faaji FM and Daar Satellite Broadcasts.
