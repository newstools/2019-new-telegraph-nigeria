At least eight people were hospitalised at Ifewara and adjourning towns of Atakumosa East Local Government Area of Osun State following a clash between the indigenes and the Hausa community. The victims, said to be Yoruba, were severely wounded during the fracas, which occurred two days ago. The crisis led to the burning of houses and destruction of other valuables in the town. Meanwhile, a top police officer, who preferred anonymity, disclosed that the police had apprehended three persons in connection with the clash. The police officer, who refused to disclose the tribe of those arrested, said the suspects had been giving clues to the police on the incident. Trouble broke out in the town on Tuesday evening when people of the two communities engaged in a freefor- all as a result of minor disagreement over sharing formula of the proceeds from the gold they mined in the town. Those involved from the two communities were hell bent on taking the lion’s share from the proceeds. The crisis snowballed into a fullscale war between the two communities, who allegedly used guns, machetes and other dangerous weapons for several hours before the intervention of the police. A witness said “youths of the gold-rich community clashed with other illegal gold miners of Hausa extraction over the sharing formula”. He said: “Many residents sustained different degrees of injuries which landed them in different hospitals while houses and shops around Oja-Tuntun, Ifewara were equally burnt by the warring combatants.” The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Folasade Odoro, confirmed the clash. She said some policemen had been drafted to the community to douse tension.
