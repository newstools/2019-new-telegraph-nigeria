The Centre for Environment, Human Rights and Development (CEHRD) has called for an organised plan to end gas flaring in oil producing communities in the Niger Delta region. The Head, Environment and Conservation of CEHRD, Dr. Kabari Sam, who made the call in a statement, also called for a change in how people handle matters relating to the environment, while the government comes up with friendly environmental policies. He equally urged the Federal Government to come up with incentives that would help end artisanal and the commencement of modular refining, just as he called for a detailed plan of action to develop infrastructure required to harness Nigeria’s wasting associated gas resources for sustainable use. He said: “Not much has been done in developed and developing countries like Nigeria to address issues related to air pollution as most economies remain fossil-fuels dependent. “In addition, government should develop target programmes and incentives to end artisanal oil refining activities and develop appropriate mechanisms towards reducing carbon-dioxide emissions from vehicles and other anthropogenic sources.”
“The much-awaited commissioning of modular refineries could reduce the activities of artisanal refining in the Niger Delta region, if inclusive participation and environmental sustainability is embedded in the venture. “We should not only focus on policy changes and development but change our everyday lifestyles, for example, eat plant-based diets, to reduce air pollution, phase out fossil fuels and reduce impacts on natural places, wildlife and our health.”
