As part of efforts to generate revenue for its members, the Nigerian Union of Musicians (NUM) is set to hold a workshop on the sale of music on the internet. The workshop which will take place on July 4th at Constantial Hotel, Benin City, is significant especially as millions of Dollars are lost yearly by musicians that do not sell their music on the internet. Selling on the internet means wordwide sales, translating into huge revenue gains. The Union in a statement said the event will also feature posthumous awards for music icons such as Rex Lawson, Celestine Ukwu, Sony Okosun, Christiana Essien and many other Nigerians musicians of blessed memory. The special guest of Honor is the Edo State Commissioner for Arts, Culture, Tourism and Diaspora, Mr. Osaze Ero. Also invited is the commissioner of Justice, Prof Yinka Omorogbe. A goodwill message is expected to be delivered by the American ambassador to Nigeria. Musicians from far and wide are expected to grace the workshop. “The NLC and RATTAWU, the mother bodies of NUM are expected to play very important roles in this august occasion of their baby union NUM,” the statement reads in part. It will be recalled that in 1960 during the independence dance party, it was NUM that insisted that a Nigerian musician plays instead of the Jamaican musician that the incoming government had slated. The union had their way.
