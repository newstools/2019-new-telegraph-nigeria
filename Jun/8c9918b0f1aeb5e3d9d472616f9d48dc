 Former football star, John Fashanu, has thrown his weight behind Liverpool winning today’s Champions League final against Tottenham Hotspur.
In a chat with Saturdays Telegraph, the former Wimbledon striker reckoned that the match is very difficult to judge considering what is at stake, he however said the Merseyside club are a great team that has consistently improved since German manager Jurgen Klopp took over pointing out that their resilience will see them through today’s clash in Madrid.
Though Fashanu, who incidentally helped Wimbledon, an underdog team to beat Liverpool to win the 1988 FA Cup final, rated London club Tottenham high, describing them a good team, the 56-year-old reckons the depth in Liverpool makes them the favourite.
Fashanu submitted: “It’s a massive game and a good PR for English football after the Europa League in midweek between Chelsea and Arsenal. Liverpool are a great team and Spurs are a good team. I put my belief on Liverpool to win. For years they have been amazing; they are like the Germans. They are pragmatic, they go through it slowly and weigh you down.”
He however warned the Reds to guide against complacency as Mauriccio pie Pochettino’ team might come all out due to the fact that it’s a one-off game.
“Liverpool are the favourites; they have the experience and history but Spurs will be all out on them because it’s the biggest match in the club’s history. It’s an enormous match but I give it to Liverpool,” he said.
