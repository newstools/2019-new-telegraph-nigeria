The Bayelsa State Government has commenced the construction of a stand-alone world-class wrestling gym at the Samson Siasia Stadium in Yenagoa. The facility, which is expected to be completed before the end of this year, will be the first of its kind in Nigeria. The gym is projected to accommodate two full-sized wrestling mats, a warm-up area, and office spaces for administrative work. The construction of the ultra-modern gym is in line with the vision of Bayelsa State Governor, Seriake Dickson, to make Yenagoa – the State capital – the hub of wrestling, not only in Nigeria, but in Africa at large. Governor Dickson has previously promised to institutionalize wrestling as a core sport and a cultural heritage of the Ijaw. Meanwhile, an elated President of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF), Daniel Igali, has hailed Governor Dickson for the historic construction of the wrestling gymnasium. “I am not surprised that the governor has commenced the construction of a wrestling gym of world class standard in Yenagoa,” the Olympic champion said. “The gym will not only help Bayelsa State athletes, but will have a very positive bearing on the national team. “Having athletes from five to six sports training in one multi-purpose hall as is the current situation all over the country impacts on concentration and adversely affects both training and ultimately performance.”  “By the construction of this wrestling gym, wrestling mats will have more durability, while athletes and coaches will be able to train in an atmosphere that will promote professionalism in our sport.  “I congratulate Governor Dickson and Bayelsa State Government for setting the pace in wrestling infrastructure in Nigeria. Our hope is that the gym will be completed in record time to aid our athletes in preparing for the Olympics next year.”
