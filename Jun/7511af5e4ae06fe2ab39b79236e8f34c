Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji, Aje Ogungunniso 1, has called for a peaceful Egungun festival celebration among diverse people of the ancient town. This year’s Egungun festival begins today in Ibadan. According to Mr Adeola Oloko, the monarch’s Personal Assistant/Director of Media and Publicity, Olubadan made this known at his Popoyemoja, Ibadan palace yesterday in his message to the people. Adetunji said that the Egungun festival was a month-long celebration of the rich customs and tradition of the people. Worried by the violent displays of many of the followers during the festival in the past, Adetunji warned, “the festival is not a licence for hoodlums to unleash terror and violence. There would be zero-tolerance for violence this year. I therefore enjoin worshippers to join hands with the law enforcement agents in maintaining peace. Anyone, who breaches security, would be prosecuted.” According to the Olubadan, the masquerades and their followers are expected to follow the routes already lined up for them by the law enforcement agents. He warned that any masquerade, who goes against the route, risks the wrath of the law. He added that the use of dangerous weapons such as guns, daggers, swords, bottles and machetes were outlawed. The traditional ruler also warned that he wouldn’t seek the bail of anyone, who goes against the law of the land in the name of Egungun celebration. According to the statement, only the Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, and the Olubadan of Ibadanland will be entertained by the masquerades.
