The Presidential Amnesty Programme has warned Niger Delta youths offered scholarship on compassionate grounds to study in universities across the country not to take the gesture as a right, but rare privilege to enable them acquire tertiary education and better their lives. The Amnesty Office said being from the Niger Delta was not an automatic qualification to enjoy the benefits of the programme, as its mandate mainly covered the management of 30, 000 persons captured in the database of beneficiaries. Murphy Ganagana, special assistant on Media to Coordinator of the Amnesty Programme, Prof. Charles Dokubo, said in a statement yesterday that the warning became necessary in view of an unruly behaviour exhibited last week by some non-beneficiaries of the programme offered scholarship on compassionate grounds at the Gregory University, Uturu, Abia State. He expressed dismay that rather than concentrating on their studies and show gratitude to the coordinator for providing them succour after they were fraudulently and illegally deployed to the university in March, last year by a former official of the Amnesty Office in the previous administration, the students who were not bona fide beneficiaries of the programme engaged in acts that breached the peace in the university. Ganagana said reports on the cause of the incident indicated that the students were simply being mischievous by demanding to be granted same allowances meant for beneficiaries of the programme on scholarship duly captured in the database, not minding the fact that they were not beneficiaries and were illegally sent to the institution through the back door.
