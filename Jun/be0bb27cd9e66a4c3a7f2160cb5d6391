Confusion had continued to trail a reported interim order allegedly granted by an Abuja High Court sitting in Bwari compelling the National Assembly to adopt the use of open ballot system in the election of presiding officers scheduled for today. Justice Othman Musa was reported to have, upon an ex-parte application and affidavit that was filed by a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Jibrin Barau, granted an interim injunction restraining the Clerk of the National Assembly, that of the Senate, as well as the Sergeant At Arms to the Senate, from relying or enforcing the Senate Standing Orders 2015 (as amended), in the conduct of election of presiding officers of the Senate, pending the determination of a substantive suit before it. The order followed a motion marked NO M/266/2019, which was anchored on Suit No. FCT/ HC/BW/CV/136/2019. Justice Musa was quoted as ruling that, “As the order was heard and made ex-parte, any party aggrieved shall file a motion to set aside or vacate the said order and serve same on the applicant or counsel before the next adjourned date.” The case was subsequently adjourned to June 13 for definite hearing.
