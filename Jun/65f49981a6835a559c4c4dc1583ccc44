The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has called on leaders across the world to condemn and see to it that the killings of people including children in Sudan is stopped. In a statement made available yesterday to journalists in Abuja, the acting NLC President, Comrade Najeem Yasin, condemned the use of what he described as “blatant force” by the military Junta against unarmed and defenseless civilians which resulted in the massacre of over 100 persons and injury of scores of protesters who were calling for the establishment of a Democratic process in their country. “It is instructive that the Junta rode on the protests of pro-democratlc forces that ousted former President Omar al-Bashlr ostensibly to protect the protesters, only to turn its guns on them and the Sudanese population. “This is an unconscionable betrayal of the Sudanese people who had suffered untold hardship and violence in the hands aI-Bashir’s Rapid Support Forces or Janjaweed which the Junta had recently unleashed on pro-democracy activists. “While applauding the timely suspension of Sudan by the African Union (AU), and the intention of the UN to intervene in the political crisis, we call on all persons of goodwill and the international community to take urgent decisive actions to call the Junta to order and offer concrete measures for the protection of the lives of activists and the people of Sudan. “The global community should unite to stop thus carnage by the military before it escalates into more killings that would derail the momentum of the struggle to re-establish negotiations leading to civilian rule under an atmosphere of free and fair elections,” he said.
