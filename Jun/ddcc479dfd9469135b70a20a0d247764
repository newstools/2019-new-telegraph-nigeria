 Former Super Eagles’ winger, Garba Lawal, has applauded the 23-player roster named by Nigeria’s coach, Gernot Rohr, for this year’s Africa Cup of Nations, declaring that the German gaffer’s choices are all in order.
Although Lawal admitted seeing Kelechi Iheanacho dropped was a huge blow for the youngster, the former battler acknowledged that the Leicester City of England star had lost form, and charged him to take his latest setback as a wake-up call to romp back stronger.
Lawal, who made top marks during his heyday with Roda JC Kerkrade of Holland and was part of Nigeria’s historic Olympic Games soccer gold winning squad of Atlanta ’96, stated further in a live interview on a Lagos-based radio station on Wednesday.
He said: “When a competition is coming, every coach wants to go with their best players, which is what Gernot Rohr has done.
“The Super Eagles’ attack is very solid and competitive. The attack is also very crucial at a competition like this. We need strikers who can score.
“At this stage, the coach had to take a crucial decision. That’s why he went for those he can count on, those doing well with their clubs.
He posited that Rohr knows the stiff challenge lying ahead of him in The Land of The Pharaohs, hence the Franco-German tactician’s desire to roll out only those players of whom he believes the best can be procured from during the thick of action at the continental soccer showpiece.
On the exclusion of Iheanacho, Lawal declared: “The exclusion of Kelechi Iheanacho is not a shock. I saw it coming, since he has not been playing for his club in England.
“Iheanacho has to change his attitude and form. He is a good player, but he has not been playing with his club.
“We saw Chukwueze, Onuachu and Onyekuru; they are all scoring for their clubs. That’s what any coach will want in his team.
“Strikers who are working for the team, scoring goals and supporting play are those who are needed in any serious and ambitious team.”
