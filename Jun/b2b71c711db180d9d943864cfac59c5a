20th May 2019, was yet another historic day in Panko community of Badagry Local Government as HRM Aholu of Ajara Agamathen, Aholu Agano Toniyon 1, installed Mr. Samson Awonronsu Gbewa as the Baale of Panko community. The Agano Toniyon 1, however, installed two Baales viz the Baale of Panko and Tande respectively. He charged the Baales and the communities to ensure that they live in peaceful co-existence with one another and prayed that their reign will usher in rapid development to their communities. Speaking after the coronation, Chief Samson Gbewa, the Jrado I of Panko community, expressed his profound appreciation.
