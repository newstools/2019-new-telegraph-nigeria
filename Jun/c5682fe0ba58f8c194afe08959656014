The Federal Government has renewed the appointment of Dr Olusegun Ojo as the director general of National Agricultural Seed Council (NASC). In a statement by the former Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, Ojo was first appointed in May 2015, at a time when the council and the seed sector were faced with challenges and dwindling resources occasioned by economic recession.  His areas of expertise include seed certification and quality control, seed production, seed testing, seed conditioning, seed storage and capacity building. Prior to his appointment in 2015, he had worked as a seed scientist for over 35 years. The minister added that Ojo had deployed his wealth of experience in transforming the council into an innovative agency that has recorded tremendous growth and progress, while the momentum toward the actualisation of its mandate continuously increases.
