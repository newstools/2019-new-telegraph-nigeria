A 39-year-old suspect, Taiwo Salami, who was among a gang which hypnotised and robbed a woman of N1.4 in Ibadan, Oyo State, has revealed how he spent his share of the loot.
Salami said he bought a Toyota Camry car and established a business for his wife.
He made the confession during the parade of suspects by the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Shina Olukolu. Salami was paraded along with Kamorudeen Amusat (63).
The commissioner said both men would be charged for conspiracy and robbery.
He said: “The two suspects were arrested around Eleyele area of Ibadan on June 7, 2019 for hypnotising Miss Mary Ajayi and collecting the cash sum of N1,400,000 from her. On May 6, 2019, about 11.30a.m, Mary Ajayi was sent to deposit a cash of N1.4 million into Access Bank, Dugbe, Ibadan by her boss, Chioma Nwali, a businessman at Oke Padre area of Ibadan. On her way to the bank, she was stopped by Salami, who spoke to her, in the process, he allegedly hypnotised her.
“She immediately lost her senses. She was thereafter taken to an uncompleted building at Inalehinde area of Ibadan, where the cash of N1.4 million was collected from her. The suspects, after successfully luring their victim into the uncompleted building and collecting the huge sum of money from her, tied her up with a white cloth and inflicted several injuries on her body. They later locked her up for three days, before she was later rescued and taken to hospital for medical treatment.”
Salami said: “I bought a Toyota Camry ‘Pencil’ car with part of the money we collected from the victim. I also set up slippers and sandals business for my wife. I gave N200,000 to my brother, Kamorudeen, who is always with me. He used to assist me every time I have an assignment.”
Exhibits recovered from the suspects are some rubber slippers and sandals and a Toyota Camry car marked OYO BDJ 53 KU.
