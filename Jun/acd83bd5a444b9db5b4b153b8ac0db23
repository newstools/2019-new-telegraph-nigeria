A 33-year-old driver, Olalekan Hammed, was yesterday remanded in prison custody for allegedly stealing $754 and killing his employer’s wife, Mrs. Jolasun Okusanya (76).
Hammed was arraigned on a two-count charge of stealing and murder before Justice Mojisola Dada of an Ikeja Special Offences Court, Lagos.
The driver was alleged to have stolen N950,000 and $117 from his employer’s bedroom. While attempting to escape, Hammed strangled Jolasun.
The state prosecutor, Mrs. O. R. Ahmed-Muili, said that the defendant allegedly committed the offence on December 3, 2018, about 12.30p.m., at Plot 33, Owukori Crescent, Alaka Estate, Lagos State. The prosecutor said that the offences contravened Sections 287 and 223 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015.
According to the charge sheet, Hammed did kill Jolasun by strangling her.
The complainant, Adetayo Okunsanya, however, in a police report, said that the defendant sneaked into her parents’ bedroom to steal money on that fateful day.
Adetayo, who is the daughter of the deceased, said that Hammed, who had worked for the family for over five years, killed her mother after she caught him stealing $754 from their bedroom.
She further told the police at the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID), Panti, Yaba, that the defendant immediately fled the scene by scaling their building fence into a nearby hotel. The defendant is a driver attached to the deceased’s daughter.
Police report showed that forensic experts and pathologist at the Lagos State, Ikeja General Hospital, revealed that the deceased had a mark of violence on her neck. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to both charges.
Justice Dada thereafter ordered that the defendant be remanded in Kirikiri Maximum Prison, pending the determination of his case. The matter was adjourned till September 10, 2019 for commencement of trial.
