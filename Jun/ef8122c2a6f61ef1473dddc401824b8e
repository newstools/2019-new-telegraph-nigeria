The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has recalled ‘Upon the Rock Honey,’ produced under unhygienic condition. In a statement by NAFDAC, signed its Director General, Prof Moji Christianah Adeyeye said the honey, which could pose danger to health, was being recalled because they were packaged under unhygienic conditions.  Adeyeye therefore threatened that the Agency would apply appropriate sanctions on the company while further stringent measures would still be taken to ensure that the company complied with relevant NAFDAC regulations and guidelines if it wanted to continue in the business. According to the statement, NAFDAC had acted based on information (video) of ‘Upon the Rock Honey’ purchased from a certain supermarket at Wuse and Garki in Abuja, circulated on social media  by a customer alleging that the product was adulterated.   The product was produced by Upon the Rock Church of God, Durumi, Abuja. NAFDAC’s Federal Capital Territory Office, Pharmacovigilance/Postmarketing and Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Directorates immediately swung into action, Adeyeye said.  She stated that investigations revealed that the company registered ‘Upon the Rock Honey’ with NAFDAC in December 2018 upon assurance that NAFDAC’s quality standards were met through proper testing and inspection. However, thereafter, the company started producing under poor hygienic conditions. The facility also added some unregistered variants of the product that were never presented to NAFDAC. Some of the products were found to allegedly have fake NAFDAC registration numbers printed on them.
