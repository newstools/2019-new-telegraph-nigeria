A group, the South- East Enlightenment Network (SE-EN) has cautioned the promoters of the alleged Islamisation agenda, saying it was a well thought out scheme to further pitch the Igbo nation against the Federal Government and create political confusion. This came barely one week after a pan-Igbo group, the Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) raised the alarm that there was a grand plot to subtly Islamise the Southeast region and other parts of the country.  The group also warned the political class from the Southeast region to be wary of every move calculated to exclude the Igbo nation from the development programs of government, by selling out to them some religious and ethnic propaganda.  President of SE-EN, Chimezie Egboh, through a statement he issued yesterday, said the Igbo must be wary of being drawn into fighting the wrong enemy by being misled into randomly attacking or killing Muslims or Fulani. Egboh, who condemned a recent communiqué issued by Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), also called on the general public to disregard it in its entirety while the Igbo nation focuses on robust and more realistic approaches to existing security challenges facing the country as they particularly affect the South-East of Nigeria.  According to the statement: “The fallout of such mistake would not only be costly, it will also stain the South-East with the stigma of starting a fight of blame even when there are indications that we have been provoked into taking certain actions.”
