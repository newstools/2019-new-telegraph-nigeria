Ahead 2023 general elections, Igbo and Yourba youths under the aegis of Yoruba Council of Youths Worldwide and Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, yesterday resolved to form alliance to raise and support credible presidential candidate from South-West or South-East region. The youth said the decision was to ensure stability in the polity and equitable distribution of power and national portfolios in the country.  They demanded implementation of the new Electoral Laws with a new caveat for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct all local government elections and ensure diaspora voting simultaneously during 2023 general elections. The youth also demanded establishment of South-West and South-East Governors Forum (SWSEGF) where all local vigilantes and security organisations in both zones would tackle herdsmen menace and other security issues in the regions.  President of Yoruba Council of Youths Worldwide, Aremo Oladotun Hassan, and President, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, at a joint press conference, who lamented high rate of killings in the two zones by armed men in the country, explained that the alliance would checkmate the ugly trend. They accused the President Muhammadu Buhariled administration of ‘Fulanising’ the nation by allowing herdsmen killings and other violent killings in the zones.   “We are deeply concerned with grave hearts of regrets as critical stakeholders being the largest umbrella body of youths in the South-West and South-East geopolitical zones of Nigeria and in the Diaspora, coupled with our unending disappointments and gross abandonment with the Muhammadu Buhari’s led Federal Government to have conspicuously allowed the dreaded ongoing ‘Fulanisation’ of Nigeria remain unmitigated, despite various mass condemnation of their terrorism atrocities, mass murder and genocidal war unleashed on innocent Nigerians in various communities across the nation, especially the recent wake of crises, killings, kidnappings and communityinvasionbybandits, under the aegis of Fulani herdsmen, ISIS, ISWA and Boko Haram terrorist groups, despite the huge billions of dollars sunk into the terrorism war, without any corresponding success to tie to it till date. “We have watched and observed with keen interest the audacious mentality and operational coherence of this dreaded groups across the nation, in view of the antimasses propositions of the government ranging from the free grazing and cattle colony expedition to the recent donation of N100 billion support funds and Fulani radio launch, all this are pointers to the element of conspiracy theory definitely suspicious of the federal myth, consent and backings of this evil machinations.
