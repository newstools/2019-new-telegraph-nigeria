A recent Canadian study from the University of Alberta has shown that home blood pressure monitors are 100 per cent accurate only about 30 per cent of the time.
The researchers however pointed out that this development was not good because high blood pressure is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the world.
High blood pressure is a common condition in which the long-term force of the blood against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems, such as heart disease.
In the small but revealing study of 85 people with high blood pressure, researchers identified what causes the problems with the readings.
Occasionally, it’s a person’s inability to run the device properly. It also can be the one-size-fits-all design; the same cuff is used for both men and women, but in the study men’s readings were more accurate. Arm shape and size can make the difference.
Nonetheless, if you have high blood pressure, it’s important to keep track of how it’s doing.
So how can you check the accuracy of your device?
First, bring your at-home monitor with you to your next doctor’s visit and check it against the doctor’s machine.
Second, have your pharmacist instruct you in proper usage, and then try it out right there and compare its reading to the pharmacy’s in-store blood pressure monitor. Almost all pharmacies now have stations where you can check your blood pressure.
