The All Progressives Congress (APC) has commended Senator Danjuma Goje for withdrawing from the 9th Senate Presidency contest in support of the party’s endorsed candidate, Senator Ahmad Lawan. Also, the National Leadership of APC commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his fatherly role in ensuring members’ compliance with party decisions and directives. A statement issued by APC National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, in Abuja said that “Goje has demonstrated himself as a reliable, committed party leader, good role model and elder statesman. We believe that Goje’s selfless actions typify APC’s progressive ideals and should be emulated by all party members to ensure unity, strength and supremacy of our great party. There is no doubt that the majority APC caucus is going into the incoming 9th National Assembly as a united house.” Also, on the Speaker for House of Representatives, the party said: “On the sponsored reports against Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, the party’s candidate for the Speakership position, 9th House of Representatives, that he was ‘convicted’ by a Court in the United States of America, we urge Nigerians to ignore the phantom and infantile allegations. “The allegations have become a reoccurring fabrication. Nigerians will recall that the same baseless allegation were made against Gbajabiamila in the lead up to the 8th National Assembly speakership race and came to naught. It needs restating that Gbajabiamila has never been convicted for any crime in Nigeria and abroad. “We urge Gbajabiamila and his vibrant campaign team to remain focused on their extensive countywide consultation and engagements which has been well-received and endorsed across party lines.”
