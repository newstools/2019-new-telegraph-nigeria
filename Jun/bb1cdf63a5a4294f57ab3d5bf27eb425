The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has charged its fact-finding committee on the role played by some of party members at the election of the presiding officers of the National Assembly to determine the extent of influence of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on PDP members who voted against the wishes of the party. The party, in a statement yesterday by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologondiyan, also wants the committee to probe why elected PDP members failed to abide by the decision of the party during the election. “Where there are established reasons for taking the action by members, the committee should identify such so that the party can create mutual and political atmosphere for reasonable interaction with Senators and Honourable members,” the statement added. The committee, which is headed by former President of the Senate, Adolphus Wabara, was approved last week at the 86th National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of PDP. The committee, according to the statement, is also to “recommend ways to checkmate such tendencies in the future and ensure that, moving forward, all members work together to defend the interest of the party at all times and circumstances.” A party source, disclosed that the party is suspecting presence of fifth columnists among its members in the National Assembly. He however, dismissed likely friction between the party leadership and National Assembly members as a result of the probe, adding that the party is enjoying the support of the newly appointed leaders in both chambers of the legislature. “It is only where there is not such support that you can talk of friction. The leaders are not happy the way the election went. That is why the party is setting up the committee,” the source said. Among members of the committee, which has three weeks to submit it report, is former PDP National Secretary, Prof. Wale Oladipo.
