Former chairman, House Committee on Petroleum Resources (Downstream) Hon. Joseph Akinlaja is a veteran labour leader who rose to the top echelon of the National Union of Petroleum and Nature Gas Workers (NUPENG ) and highly knowledgeable on issues in the oil and gas sector. In this interview with ONWUKA NZESHI, the parliamentarian shares his thoughts on the resurging subsidy controversy and the fuel tanker armada on the Apapa/Oshodi Expressway, Lagos  The controversy over the payment of subsidy on petroleum products has bounced back again following the alarm raised by the former Central Bank of Nigeria, governor Sanusi Lamido that the Federal Government spent N1.5 trillion on subsidy scheme which he described as fraudulent. What’s your view on subsidy regime in Nigeria and what do we do about it? Well, I will like to confirm that subsidy exists in Nigeria. I’m saying this because there have been so many theories on it over the years. Some people say there is no subsidy while others say that our fuel should not sell more the N45 per litre. A lot of theories have been propounded both by people who know and people who don’t know but just assume. Officially, subsidy existed in budgetary terms up to year 2016 but later the Federal Government said there would be no more subsidies. So the government was no longer bringing budget items specifically for subsidy to be appropriated by the National Assembly.
It went on to increase the pump price of petrol to N145 per litre on the premise that there would be no subsidy any more. But they forgot that we are not in control of two critical factors which determine the price of petroleum products, namely: the price of crude oil at the International market and the exchange rate of the Naira to the Dollar. So by the time government increased the pump price to N145, it was saving money because the crude oil price vis- a- vis the foreign exchange did not add up to N145 per litre. They never believed that those factors would ever work together above N145 per litre. But one and a half years <img class="size-medium wp-image-223225 alignleft" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Akinlaja.png?resize=300%2C159&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="159" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Akinlaja.png?resize=300%2C159&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Akinlaja.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1">after the pump price was raised to N145 per litre, landing cost of the imported Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) rose beyond their expectation. We’re talking about petrol because as you know, diesel is deregulated. As for Kerosine, we don’t know whether it is deregulated or not because there has been no clear-cut policy on it. It is market forces that have been controlling the price of Kerosine. So we’re talking about PMS which is widely and heavily consumed by Nigerians. Your ‘I Better Pass My Neighbour’ generator and your small and medium scale industries use petrol engines much more than other engines to power their activities. At the peak of it in late 2017 and early 2018, there was heavy fuel scarcity and my committee, as the Chairman, House Committee on Petroleum Resources (Downstream) and my counterpart in the Senate went round to find out the reason for the fuel shortage. We invited stakeholders including the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to a public hearing. The NNPC and the Minister for Petroleum Resources, Ibe Kachikwu told us that landing cost at that time was N171.20 per litre and the pump price was still N145 per litre then asked: ‘Who is bearing the cost of N26.20 per litre of petrol consumed in Nigeria? They said it was under-recovery but somebody was and is still picking that bill. Definitely, it is not the consumer. It is any of the agencies representing the government that is picking the bill till today.  So the Emir of Kano (Sanusi) being a former Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and an economist knows or should know the situation. That is why occasionally, he comes out with such things that some people consider controversial.   This subsidy controversy has lingered for so many years. What do you think is the best way to resolve it? As someone who has been at the top echelon of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), I have dealt with this matter over the years. I was the Deputy General Secretary of NUPENG under Chief Frank Kokori and when he retired, I took over as General Secretary. As Deputy President of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) under Adams Oshiomhole, we fought against the removal of subsidy. We were acting on behalf of Nigerians because we asked ourselves: ‘What benefit would Nigerians derive from this God-given resource if they should be made to pay exorbitant price for Petrol?’ We fought that the refineries should work and we formed the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) as part of the fight. Unfortunately the PPPRA failed to regulate anything because it is also overwhelmed by the inter-play of market forces.
However, with benefit of hindsight, I have now realised that in Nigeria, we do not have the discipline to operate any subsidy.  Why do you think so when subsidy operates in other countries? The developed countries also subsidise products. America subsidises agriculture. When the farmers have produced, government through commodity boards buys it, processes and preserves it until when they would either export it or release it to the market for local consumption.
The essence of buying it off is to relieve the farmer burden of preserving these produce and enable him to have money to go back and farm the following year. But in our own case, the tomato will get rotten in the farm because the farmer does not have the wherewithal to preserve the produce. He has to look for a buyer; he has to look for a transporter to convey his produce to the markets and he doesn’t have the money to do all these things before the good perish in the farm. In this country, during the Murtala/Obasanjo regime, which dove-tailed into President Shehu Shagari’s regime, there was what we called essential commodities. It was basically a subsidy of basic food items such as salt, milk, tea, sardine and others. These commodities were sold at subsidized rates. What happened to it? Middlemen took over the distribution chain and by the time these commodities get to the real consumers, the ordinary people, it had passed through many hands and the price had gone beyond the reach of the poor. So those targeted by the essential commodity did not benefit from it and the scheme collapsed.  What exactly makes fuel subsidy a challenge in Nigeria? The Oligarchy and the Cabal, these are some of the names coined to show what is happening in the place. Up till now, we have not been able to resolve the controversy surrounding how much subsidy Nigeria pays on fuel daily. The government has its own figure and marketers have their own figure. There has to be reconciliation every day. Today, no oil marketing company can import petrol except the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Why? NNPC gets an allocation of 445,000 barrels of crude oil per day for local refineries that never work up to maximum installed capacity. Therefore whatever remains, NNPC has to swap it with refineries outside Nigeria to be able to import petrol. This is where the subsidy lies now. Otherwise, there would have been fuel scarcity all over the country.   Why are the major and independent marketers no longer importing fuel? They cannot bring it at the landing cost above N145 per litre and still sell at N145 per litre. It does not make good business sense to continue investing money on a business you can only incur losses. With the benefit of hindsight, with the fact that we do not have the discipline to honestly operate a subsidy regime, subsidy should be removed. But, who will bell the cat? Nigerians have been so much pauparized that even if a policy is working against their interest, they will resist its removal.  Was the Jonathan administration right when it attempted to remove subsidy on petrol in 2012? Yes, we ought to have allowed him to remove subsidy at that time because the decision he took was right. I was one of the few legislators that said that we should remove subsidy at that time. If you go to the Hansards – records of parliamentary proceedings, you will see it there.
For many years, people have been importing petroleum products and making huge profits from the business. It was these fuel importers that killed the local refineries. There is no incentive to make the existing local refineries work or to build new ones. While we were stuck on fuel importation, Ghana bit the bullet, they deregulated and their Tema Lube is working. The Tema Lube, their refinery was built in 1965 by the Anglo Dutch multinational – Shell BP, same year the same company built our own refinery in Port Harcourt. The irony is that while the refinery in Ghana is still working, ours has gone comatose. Their own refinery refines petrol and also produces lubricants and started functioning even before oil was discovered in Ghana.  What is the implication of Nigeria not encouraging local refining of crude oil? We are exporting jobs offshore because our crude oil is being refined offshore. We are creating jobs for those countries where we go to refine our crude oil.   Why didn’t your colleagues in the parliament, the opposition, labour unions and the civil society heed your counsel in 2012? It is because at that time, subsidy had become a political issue. It had become political so much so that the opinions of genuine people, like we were in the trade unions, did not matter any longer. Some beneficiaries of the ill-gotten money from subsidy payments were fuelling the fight against deregulation. Those who are still fighting against removal of subsidy are an admixture of genuine patriots who believe they are fighting for the poor masses and the pseudo -patriots who are beneficiaries of subsidy.   Many Nigerians including your colleagues   in the Labour movement have always demanded that before subsidy can be removed, our local refineries must be fixed and working. How do you see this argument? Yes. It’s a good argument but who will make the refineries work? It is the people that have the wherewithal but they are either the importers or agents of importers.  Are you satisfied with the way NNPC has turned itself into a monopoly in the business of fuel importation? I won’t blame the NNPC because it is a responsibility that has been entrusted on it. They did not create it. If the NNPC had not taken up that responsibility on itself, fuel would sell at N250 or N300 per litre on the street. You know what happens during fuel scarcity, sometimes it sells as much as N400 per litre. They will carry fuel in jerry cans and stand along the road to sell both genuine and adulterated fuel. At that time, your driver will be sucking fuel with his mouth forgetting that this fuel contains lead which kills instalmentally. It is a government policy that made them sole importers of fuel and they are the only one who can do it. Why? It is not their money; it is Nigeria’s money and they are playing this role to prevent fuel scarcity.  Why did the NNPC that has four refineries leave them to rot away instead of fixing them? Up to 1987, our refineries were working at almost installed capacity. Why? Those who built the refineries and the government had a programme that they must train Nigerian engineers on how to maintain and service it. The agreement was for the refineries to undergo a Turn Around Maintenance (TAM), once in two years and Nigerian engineers were doing it. All they needed to do was to import the parts and fix it. But then, another government policy came to be awarding it as a contract. They awarded the TAM contract for Kaduna Refinery to Total. We now had a French company coming with French technology to come and maintain a facility built by Chiyoda, a Japanese company.
They abandoned Chiyoda that built it. So government policy is one of the problems. The second reason is what I’ve told you earlier. When people make commission from importation, it will be difficult to stop them. If you ask NNPC till tomorrow whether they are making money out of the fuel importation, they will deny and there is no way you can catch them. You can only catch them by the elbow and they will simply stretch their hands and walk away. If you make the refineries work, where would the importers make their money from? I am told that those who sell gun- powder will not allow war to end. If war ends, their business will be adversely affected. So the matter of some people profiteering from fuel importation remains in the realm of speculations. The one that is real is that the Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) that is supposed to be done once in two years is not done some times for ten years and by the time they come to do it, a lot of parts had been damaged and it becomes story! Story!! Story!!!  We will ever get out of this quagmire? We will, if we are willing to get out of it. I thought that with the personality and character of President Muhammadu Buhari that he would be able to do it in his first term of office, but then that did not happen. Perhaps it is because he is no more a military head of state and he is operating under a civilian atmosphere and he must work with people. Some of these people ensured his victory, so when he is fighting, he will be fighting from all fronts. You know he can’t fight alone. If the government is ready for us to leave this situation and everybody cooperates with the government, we will get out of it.  Has the National Assembly done enough to get Nigeria out of this problem? Yes, I will say we tried during the period I was there. What’s the evidence? The evidence is that the 8th National Assembly initiated bills on the various reforms required in the petroleum industry. It is a private member bill, initiated from the National Assembly to try and cure a malady that has trailed the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), an executive bill that has been in the parliament for more than a decade. From my own observation, various conflicting interests still bugged the private member bills down. One of them, the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill (PIGB) which we concluded, passed and transmitted to the President was returned to us with some observations. We addressed the observations for the thing to be on its way back to Mr. President for assent and then we left. It took us three and a half years to pass the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) which we had to split into four parts namely, Governance, Host Community, Fiscal and that’s why I said that if we are willing we can get it done. We needed to capture the interests of the various stakeholders including the federal government, host communities and International Oil Companies (IOCs), because nobody will give you their technology unless you also take care of their interests. This drilling of oil is not a thing you use a hoe and digger; it is technology and somebody owns it. So his interest is important before you become self sufficient to be able to take it over. You who want to take it over must make some concessions because technology transfer is theory. You either acquire it or you steal it. Countries that believed they can have done it and I think we too can do it, if we are willing.  Some Nigerians have argued that conflicting regional interests is a major factor why the PIB has remained a proposal for several years. Do you share this view? No! The one that I can say may have affected the PIB is the host community interests and that is why we had a separate bill to address those community interests. If you are talking about the North vs. South, the issues of ownership of oil; that has been addressed by the concession for increased oil exploration in the North. What is affecting the bill is conflicting interests between the government and the host communities, who are demanding for more than what they have been getting before. The IOCs also believe that they have the technology and if they have the opportunity to cheat us, they will not hesitate to do so. There are all sorts of interests but unless the government which is the overall driver is focused and ready to step on toes and the toes they step on are ready to nurse the wound and allow things to move forward, we won’t go anywhere with the bill. This is why we are where we are today.  What is the implication of our inability to get this bill passed and signed into law? Let me tell you the danger in it. I am sorry for myself as a parliamentarian and Nigeria as a whole because while we were in this motion without movement, the consultants that were working along with us have taken the issue beyond our shores. What they prepared for us has found its way into the hands of other countries such as Ghana and Angola. They just looked at it, dusted it, adopted it and signed the bill into law while we are still arguing here. Don’t forget that capital is a coward, it goes to places of least resistance. The investors have moved to Ghana, Angola and other places. At the peak of the oil industry while I was there, we had thirty two drilling rigs operating onshore, swamp, offshore and deep waters. Today, we have only seventeen rigs. So why we were still hesitating, others are moving. Don’t also forget that many years before now; we did not have more than four oil producing countries in Africa. Today, they are more than eighteen and the IOCs have choices. You could see how they are divesting from Nigeria. ExxonMobil recently said it was going to divest; Shell has already divested; Total Upstream has divested part of its investments in Nigeria. These are the consequences of not having a clear policy direction and legal framework.  The gridlock in Apapa, is a fallout of the policy on fuel importation and the presence of the fuel depots in the vicinity of the Lagos ports. What is the solution to the gridlock? Well, our problem is an integrated problem and it is still a policy somersault problem. At the beginning of downstream sector of the oil industry in Nigeria, there were only seven systems. The Esso, Total, Shell and others. They were seven and they all had their depots at Apapa. They had parking spaces for their vehicles. When the industry developed, there were increased activities and the government started building a network of pipelines to convey fuel to different parts of the country. When the pipelines came on stream, oil activities shifted away from Lagos to the twenty two PPMC Depots across the country. Trucks could now load fuel from Calabar, Benin, Enugu, Jos, Makurdi and all the other strategic depots and Apapa became empty. Immediately, pipeline vandalisation started and the integrity of the pipelines became compromised. At the same time, the refineries had stopped working at maximum capacity and importation started in full swing. The policy of Nigeria being in the commanding heights of the downstream sector led to the building of more strategic depots. During the building of strategic depots, starting with WAWABECO , Tincan Island and later ASCON and Zenon. As NUPENG, we put up a battle with the Lagos State Government during which we advised them not to allow any one build depots with parking space for tankers. There was nothing that I did not do because I was directly in charge of tanker drivers. I even made an analogy that it is only in Nigeria that I see people building supermarkets without parking space, hence while you are shopping inside the supermarket, LASTMA is toying away your vehicle parked on the road. In civilized climes, parking space is often bigger than the supermarket itself and that’s why they make the supermarkets skyscrapers. We picketed several depots and took over the Ibru Depot by force for tankers to go and pack there. They sold every inch of the land; the Ministry of Physical Planning approved and every inch of the place was depot. So where will the tankers pack? Now the integrity of the pipeline did not allow fuel to go through the pipelines, therefore almost all tankers must come to Lagos. Where do they have the facility to import? It is only Atlas Cove because it has the capacity to receive vessels conveying 30,000 tons of fuel. The other depots are in shallow waters. So from Atlas Cove, they pump fuel to Ejigbo and to the private depots. Everybody will leave Kano, Kaduna, Gombe , Maidiguri and other places to come to Lagos to lift fuel. When this was happening, Gen. Abdulkareem Adisa was the Minister of Works and Housing and he ordered that all vehicles packing under the bridge to leave . We told the tanker drivers, run for your dear lives. It was during the military regime. We told them to go to Ogere and stay there until it is your turn to load fuel. Then there was fuel scarcity and Adisa called me to find out what was responsible. So I told him how his order to tankers caused the scarcity. He then asked for a way out. I told him there can be only two solutions: Relocate the depots to Ikorodu, Ekpe or Ijebu -Ode and the tankers will go there. He said we cannot remove those depots. I said then, what do we do? I gave him the second solution which is looking for a large expanse of land to build a park for these tankers because if you don’t want them to pack under the bridges then you must provide an alternative place. We now got an expanse of land in Orile but the place is in a swamp. It is only the government that can get a construction firm like Julius Berger to sand fill the place and construct a park as a social service. That place can contain 2,500 tankers and if you move 2,500 tankers out of Apapa leaving only those that are ready to load, you would have solved the problem.
