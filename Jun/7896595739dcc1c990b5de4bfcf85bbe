Immediate past governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, yesterday urged Igbo leaders to mend fences with the rest of the country for the development of the South- East. Okorocha, now senator representing Imo West Senatorial District, made the call shortly after he was sworn in by the Presi-dent of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan. The former governor said he had come to the Senate to build the bridge connecting the Igbo with other ethnic groups in the country. He said: “I am here basically to fulfil certain things that are very dear to my heart and one of them is that, having realised that the bridge connecting the South-East and the rest of the Nigerian states seems to have been very faulty,resulting from the politics people have played in the South-East, it would be my pleasure to build this connecting bridge so that the South-East people live along with other geopolitical zones of the country. “I think there is need for the Igbo to mend political fences with every Nigerian to get things right. And that will help them for the development of the South- East politically. It is a common knowledge that we are neither here nor there. We are not in any political party neither are we making any impact to belong to any political party. So, there is need for us to get married to the rest of the nation, politically.” When asked whether the All Progressive Congress (APC) would concede the presidency of the country to the South-East in 2023, Okorocha said that power was not given but taken. The senator said that the people of South-East could not fold their hands and wait for power to be given to them, stressing that Nigeria could not give the zone power just because it wanted power. He added: “This is the sentiment we sometimes make on issues. You cannot be talking of Igbo presidency, it doesn’t exist. We should be talking of Nigerian president of Igbo extraction. But that depends on what other geopolitical zones think about the position.”
