A Magistratesâ€™ Court sitting in Benin, Edo State has sentenced a 35-year-old man, David Ejike, to three months imprisonment for assaulting two policemen.
The court, however, gave him an option of fine of N35,000.
The policemen are Inspector Josephine Ogbeifun and Sergeant Momoh Mfon.
Ejike committed the offence on March 19, 2019 at New Benin Market in Oredo Local Government Area.
He had pleaded not guilty to the four-count charge preferred against him which bothered on resisting arrest, assault, unlawful damage and breach of peace.
The police prosecutor, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Patrick Agbonifo, told the court that the convict also damaged property worth N134,000 belonging to one Ezekiel Mgbalu.
Agbonifo had called six witnesses to testify in the course of trial but Ejike did not call any witness.
The magistrate, Ivie Akhere, found Ejike guilty on all the charges.
Akhere sentenced him to three months imprisonment or an option of N50,000 fine.
