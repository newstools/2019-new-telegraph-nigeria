Onyekachi John, a business man and nine others emerged winners last weekend at the May monthly draw of the DiamondXtra season 11 reward scheme powered by Access Bank Plc.
Speaking shortly after receiving the N1 million prize cheque, in a statement from the lender, John told newsmen that he had been a customer of Access Bank for years, adding that he never knew he would emerge winner someday.
“I feel so happy and so excited and did not even believe I would become a winner in the first place,” exclaimed. “All I had to do was to top my DiamondXtra Savings account, which I started with N5000 before I constantly topped it with bigger amounts which as a result made me N1 million richer today.
“I want to say a big thank you to Access Bank as they are stronger and bigger now, I will also encourage other Nigerians to partake in this initiative because whatever they say they will do, they end up making their customers happy”.
According to the Head, Consumer Liability Products, Access Bank, Osita Ede, “The DiamondXtra reward scheme is open to new and existing customers and all you need to do is visit the nearest Access bank branch, open a DiamondXtra account and fund it with N5,000. The more multiples of N5,000 you save, the higher your chance of winning. The draws scheduled to hold across the six geopolitical zones this season reaffirms Access Bank’s commitment to financially empower more Nigerians,” concluded Osita.
