He warned of attempt to muzzle the legislature and the other arms of thegovernment by the ruling party, urging the APC to respect the doctrine of the separation of powers. “Indications are clearly showing that full blown dictatorship is brewing in our country. When a supposed democratic government brazenly muscles all the other arms of government, the legislature, the judiciary and even the press, the fourth estate of the realm, we should be worried at what is loading in our polity,” Secondus stated. He noted the alleged dictatorial tendencies of the APC administration in the last four years and the propensity to disregard the rule of law and other principles of democracy
