The International Air Transport Association (IATA), has named Lufthansa Group Chief Executive Officer, Carsten Spohr, as Chairman of its Board of Governors (BoG) for a one-year term effective from the conclusion of the 75th IATA Annual General Meeting in Seoul, Republic of Korea. Spohr is the 78th chairman of the IATA BoG and was on the since May 2014. He succeeds Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, Akbar Al Baker, who remains as member of the board. Excited by this development, Spohre expressed his dedication to serve as he said that: “I’m honoured and excited to take on this role at this important time for our industry. We face a number of challenges, including growing protectionism, high taxes and trade wars. Probably the greatest challenge of all is sustainability. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) is a major achievement that will stabilise our carbon emissions from 2020. ‘‘Now we must map out the path to achieving our much more ambitious 2050 goal – to cut net emissions to half 2005 levels. Aviation is serious about its climate change commitments. And we will be pushing hard for governments to do their part by sorting air traffic management inefficiencies and laying the policy framework for the commercialization of sustainable aviation fuels.” The new chairman has been chairman of the Executive Board of Deutsche Lufthansa AG since May 1, 2014. In this role, he manages the Lufthansa Group comprising the business segments Network Airlines, Eurowings and Aviation Services, with around 135,000 employees worldwide. Spohr began his aviation career after receiving a graduate degree in business engineering at the University of Karlsruhe and holds an A320 family captain’s license.  IATA also announced that JetBlue Airways President and Chief Executive Officer, Robin Hayes, will serve as chairman of the BoG from June 2020, following Spohr’s term.
