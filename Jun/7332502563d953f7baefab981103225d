An Ikeja Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court in Lagos yesterday ordered a 56-year-old man, Charles Yoroh, to be remanded in prison custody for allegedly defiling a minor.
Yoroh was remanded pending advice from the state Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The magistrate, Mrs. Olufunke Sule-Amzat, who gave the order, adjourned the case till July 15.
The defendant, who resides at Iyana-Ipaja, Lagos, is facing a charge of defilement.
Earlier, the prosecution counsel, ASP Benson Emuerhi, told the court that Yoroh committed the offence on May 3 at Aboru Hotel, Iyana-Ipaja.
Emuerhi alleged that Yoroh lured a 14-year-old girl to a hotel and unlawfully defiled her by forcibly having sexual intercourse with her.
The prosecutor, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), said that the defendant was apprehended by the police and that the case was referred to the Gender Section at the Ikeja Police Command for further investigation. He added that the offence contravened the provisions of Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
Section 137 prescribes 14 years imprisonment for defilement, if found guilty.
