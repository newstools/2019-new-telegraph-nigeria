  Tuesday looked so promising and Adele was very happy. The only dark spot was the fact that Jay hadn’t answered her calls or called back, neither did he respond to her text messages. It wasn’t the first time such would happen but she just wasn’t feeling too cool about it anymore. By midday, she got really worried. Why wasn’t he answering her calls? Could something be wrong? An icy hand grabbed her chest and her heart raced. Jay detested her getting family involved whenever he didn’t return home. The last time she called Big Aunty, when he didn’t come home for two days, he nearly hit her in anger when he got back home. She toyed with the idea of calling Big Aunty, and decided against it. She called Ken, Blossom’s hubby, instead. After the pleasantries, she went to the reason she called. “Jay hasn’t been home since Sunday. I’m worried stiff,” she said. Ken laughed. “Women! Jay’s not a baby that you have to worry over. He’s a man…an adult. He could have travelled for business, you know,” Ken said unconvincingly. “I doubt it,” Adele said slowly. “Don’t worry dear, he’s okay. He’ll be back home. Will call him,” Ken tried to reassure her. Adele thanked him and felt a bit relieved. Ken knew that Jay was cooped up somewhere with a babe. He smiled. Jay seemed to be beating them hands down in this game. He laughed loud. “These old ladies at home think they can imprison guys,” he muttered to himself and laughed again. He would call Jay, but not now. It’s high time he got himself another bushmeat. He’d had enough of the one he was seeing presently. She was beginning to demand for an arm and a leg. After about an hour, something started nudging her mind. She couldn’t lay her finger on it but something wasn’t just right. She managed to wade through the day’s job and by 4pm, she couldn’t concentrate anymore. She closed for the day and because her mind was not together, she made the mistake of hitting the road at 4:30pm and got trapped in a gridlock. About an hour later, she felt something gnawing at her tummy. The pain gradually increased in intensity until it was like her tummy was on fire. Fear gripped her. She was all alone in the car in the middle of Third Mainland Bridge and the long queue of vehicles snaking as far as eyes <img class="size-medium wp-image-219292 alignleft" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Homeless-landlady.png?resize=300%2C167&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="167" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Homeless-landlady.png?resize=300%2C167&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Homeless-landlady.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1">could see were inching painfully. Adele prayed silently. She was always afraid of traffic because of the urchins that seize the opportunity to rob motorists who usually were at their mercy. But at this moment, the fear of robbers was furthest from her mind. The pain in her tummy, which was coming and going at intervals, was all she was thinking of. Around past 8pm, she honked her car horn in front of her gate with relief. A few minutes later, she honked again, wondering what was keeping the security man so long from opening the gate. After the fourth attempt, she alighted from her SUV, went to the gate and slipped her hand into the little opening so she could unbolt the foot passage and enter the compound. To her utter surprise, the bolt was locked with a padlock. She had always hated it when people in neighboring houses honked continuously in front of their gate. To her, they were constituting a public nuisance. She wondered where the security man on duty could have gone. What if he was fast asleep? She decided to call him on the phone instead. John answered immediately the phone rang. “Good evening madam,” he greeted respectively. There was no urgency in his voice. Adele boiled with anger, but managed to keep it out of her voice. “I have been honking outside here and you’re nowhere to be found,” she said in response to his greeting. “Madam, I’ve gone on my off,” John said. “Gone on your off? Who authorised that? Who did you inform? Did you discuss it with me? I think you’re no longer interested in this job. So, where did you drop the gate keys?” She asked in disbelief. “Madam I’m sorry, it’s Aunty…I mean Oga, no Aunty that said I should take some days off. I thought you’re aware ma,” he said falteringly. “Oga, Aunty? What are you talking about, John?” She asked, shaking her head to be sure she was awake. “Yes madam. Oga came back with Aunty. Aunty said Oga was not feeling fine. Then she said I should go for my off and I told her that I had gone for off last two weeks, that I’m going month end. But she said I must go or I lose my job. I told him I had to wait to open the gate for you and take permission from you. But she said she would open the gate for you and explain to you. She took the keys from me,” John explained. “And where was Oga while she was telling you all these?” She asked. “Oga was inside the house…” John said. “And who is this Aunty?” Adele asked, her heart palpating. “Madam I don’t know her. I’ve never seen her before. But she came in with Oga in the morning and went inside the house. She came out in the afternoon and told me to take five days off Ma,” John said. “It’s okay John. Thank you. I’ll call you later,” she said. She was really really confused. An Aunty? From where? She dialed Jay’s number and it rang out seven times. On her eighth dialed, Jay’s phone was switched off. She became more confused. The pain gnawed at her tummy again and she almost doubled over. She shuffled into her SUV, sat down and stared at her locked gate. The whole thing was just like she was watching a movie. She pinched herself and felt the pain. It was real! She honked again and felt embarrassed. What if neighbours came out and found her locked out of her own house? She laughed mirthlessly. What could be going on inside her house? Who was the Aunty in her house? Who empowered her to dictate to her staff.. She dialed Blossom’s number and ended it almost immediately. What would she tell her? What would she tell anybody? That her husband locked her out of her matrimonial home? That an ‘Aunty’ drove her out of her house? She turned on the ignition. But, where would she go? To a neighbour’s house? Family or friend’s house? What would she tell them? She needed a place to sleep this night. Or, would she sleep inside her car? She glanced at her rear window and noticed two people in front of the house opposite hers. They were looking at her. She didn’t know when they got there. They could have been there all along. She felt ashamed, pulled out of her driveway, and drove out. As she got to the gate of the estate, she wondered where she would turn. She decided to go lodge into a hotel for the night. Yeah, that would be the only place that would hide her shame. But, how would she go to the office in the morning? She had no change of clothes. Well, a good hotel would boast of a boutique. She would drive to Ikeja GRA. Immediately her mind was made up, the pain came again with such intensity that she cried out. She stepped on the break and did a U-turn. The sensible place to go right now was a hospital. To the hospital she headed. She drove into the hospital at past 10pm. After the preliminary checks, the doctor prescribed some drugs and sent her to the pharmacy. “Doc, this pain may return in the night. I think I should be admitted for the night” she told him. “Madam, the drugs I prescribed will really take care of the pain. There’s nothing to worry about,” the doctor said soothingly. “No doc, I think it’s better you admit me, so you can keep an eye on me,” she insisted. The doctor stared at her. “How’s Jay? Haven’t seen him in a long while,” he said. “He travelled,” she lied. “Oh, now I understand why you don’t want to go home,” he said kindly. Adele smiled. “In that case, I’d convert this night’s dose to a jab. It’ll work faster and I’m adding relaxant too to it,” he said, thumbing his bell. “Thank you very much doctor,” Adele said. She was really grateful for the roof over her head. A nurse walked in. “Prepare a private room for madam,” the doctor told her. “Yes doctor,” the nurse said, picking the patient’s prescription. Twenty minutes later, Adele was settled in a private ward. When she looked around her, she burst into tears and wept. She picked her phone again and dialed her hubby’s line. It was switched off. She broke into tears again. She was still crying when her phone beeped. It was a message from Bolan. “My dream, hope you’re good? I have called thrice and you didn’t answer. Hope there’s no problem? I still love you and I’m patiently waiting for the day you’ll realise that my love for you is genuine,” the message said. Without thinking, she dialed his number and he answered immediately. “My angel, oh my angel. How are you? You’re calling this late? Hope there’s no problem? Where are you?” Bolan asked in his cool, calm voice. “I’m in the hospital,” Adele sobbed into the phone. “Hospital? What’s wrong with you?” He asked, alarmed. “My tummy aches,” she sobbed. “Your tummy? What did you eat? Which hospital? Where?” He asked. She sobbed louder. “Can I come and see you? I mean, is your hubby with you?” He asked. “He’s not here,” she sobbed. “Can I come and see you?” He asked. The concern in his voice was unmistakable. He was very worried. “Yes, you can come,” Adele said in between sobs. She gave him the name and directions to the hospital and felt a bit better… ########## Let’s continue this interesting journey on Sunday!  Send your observations to: julietbumah@gmail.com
