A Magistratesâ€™ Court sitting at Igede-Ekiti, Ekiti State yesterday sentenced a 70-year-old man, Adeyeye Olorunyomi, and his two sons to 54 months imprisonment for conspiring to commit felony.
The septuagenarian and his sons, Akindele Olorunyomi (30) and Ojo Olorunyomi (36), were arraigned on a six-count charge of forcibly entering a farm belonging to Oluwadare Olowookere and Adekunle Olowookere.
The police prosecutor, Sergeant Olubu Apata, said the offence was committed in the town between February 25 and 27, 2019.
Apata said that the convicts stole three tree valued at N100,000 belonging to the complainants.
The prosecutor added that the convicts also obstructed Inspector Aliyu Umar and four other police officers from effecting their arrest, after a complaint was lodged against them at the Igede-Ekiti Police Station.
He said the convicts also conducted themselves in a manner likely to cause breach of peace by marking 28 trees with machetes on the farmland of the complainants.
Apata said that the convicts did unlawfully damage the economic trees such as cocoa trees, kola nut trees, banana trees and cocoa yam belonging to the complainants.
The convicts pleaded not guilty to all the charges and the matter proceeded to trial.
The prosecutor said the offences contravened Sections 516, 81, 390, 356 (2), 249(d) and 451 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Ekiti State, 2012.
He added that the convicts claimed that the land was given to the complainants by their great grandfather but the complainants countered that the land had been in their possession for over 100 years.
The magistrate, Mrs. Adesola Omotoso, sentenced each convict on counts one, two and three to six months imprisonment, while in counts four, five and six, they were discharged.
Omotoso, therefore, sentenced the convicts to six months imprisonment to run concurrently without an option of fine.
