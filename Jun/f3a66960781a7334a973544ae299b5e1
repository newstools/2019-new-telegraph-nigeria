Seven people have emerged as winners in the 2019 edition of TECNO SPARK Light Up Your Dream contest.
The winners according to a statement, went home with N1,000,000 (one million naira) each after the grand finale and raffle draw held in Lagos recently.
The competition, which started in April and as part of the TECNO Spark 3 launch activities, had many young Nigerian entrepreneurs with various business interests ranging from agriculture to technology, sharing their business dreams with the hope of winning the one million naira prize money.
“It was a tough contest involving rigorous reviews and assessments, and at the end of the month-long activity, ten entrepreneurs were shortlisted, even though only nine showed up.
“The selected nine people pitched their ideas to a distinguished panel of judges that included the CEO of 360 Group, Noble Igwe and Nollywood actress, Juliana Olayode, popularly known as Toyo Baby,” TECNO said.
Speaking on the contest, PR and Strategic Partnership Manger, TECNO Nigeria, Jesse Oguntimehin, stated : “Although the initiative was an experiment the brand decided to carry out, over the years, it has been a huge success.”
He also said that the initiative was conceived with the intention of making a positive impact on the different local communities in Nigeria by empowering budding entrepreneurs to achieve their lifelong dreams because TECNO really is for Nigerians.
At the end of the pitching, two winners were selected based on their communication skills, creativity, and business acumen. The two winners, Amaka Judith, a shoemaker and Mercy Orlu, a soap maker, went away with N1 million each.
