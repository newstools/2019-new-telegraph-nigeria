Nollywood actress and filmmaker, Ruth Kadiri, has shared some interesting points on relationships for celebrities.
In a recent post shared on Instagram, Kadiri, directed her statement to upcoming actresses who are looking to settle down at some point.
She stated that being a celebrity is not easy and comes with its own problems, for which reason she adviced that any upcoming actress who desires to settle down should try to nurture a relationship before finding the spotlight.
Kadiri als hammered that women who fight over men are wasting their time and will eventually need help to keep up the fight.
Meanwhile, a video clip of a young Nigerian lady crying on a street in Lagos over her inability to find a man to settle down with has gone viral.
The unidentified lady can be seen crying and screaming and asking why God has forsaken her concerning her desire to be married.
Judging from her outburst, no man has shown interest in marrying her and given societal demands for a woman to be married at a certain age, she is now utterly frustrated and has taken to the street to hammer and wallow in self-pity.
