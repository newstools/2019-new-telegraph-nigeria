After the marriage breakup of The Ooni of Ile-Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi to Olori Zainab Etiti, all eyes glued on the handsome monarch to see who was going to become the new Olori and eventually, the classy king unveiled Evangelist Silekunol Moronke Naomi as the woman of his choice. Of course, divergent views trailed Naomi as the choice of the King. While some felt the wife lacked enough exposure, others felt it was a matter of time before her new status beclouds her. However, months after Evangelist Naomi has become the Olori, not minding all that has been said, she has remained her usual self who loves to go about her businesses in a quiet manner even as she holds to her dignity and virtues as a respectable woman. However, while she is not given to showing up at different social functions, the tall, light skinned beautiful Olori finds time to stand up for causes that are worth her time. She was recently spotted in an advocacy program for the freedom of kidnapped Chibok girl, Leah Shaibu. The event was held in Washington DC.
