Another aide of the the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, Mr. Olu Onemola, Special Assistant on New media yesterday resigned his appointment. His resignation was made public in a statement issued in Abuja by the Special Assistant to the President of the Senate on Media & Publicity, Mohammed Isa.
According to the statement, Onemola conveyed his resignation in a letter addressed to the President of the Senate. Onemola, who also served the immediate past President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, in the same capacity, explained that he decided to resign because of the controversy that trailed the appointment. In the letter, Onemola thanked Lawan for the offer to continue to serve and promote the work of the 9th Senate, stating that his choice by Lawan was borne out of his patriotic desire to serve the Nigerian people.
Part of the letter reads: “a few days ago, I was asked to continue in my role as the Special Assistant on New Media to His Excellency, the President of the 9th Senate. “As an individual who prides myself in always setting a high standard and significant precedents-I feel honoured to have been asked to fill this vital role in the service of our great country. “I thank you sir, for the offer to continue on to serve and promote the work of the 9th Senate of the Federal Republic-which I am sure is borne out of your patriotic desire to serve the Nigerian people. “However, at this time, given my antecedents and the controversy this has generated, I would respectfully like to be excused from taking up this national assignment.
“It is my hope that whoever does fill this role will build upon what we have started in terms of opening up the activities of the Nigerian Senate to the public”. The statement also hinted that the President of the Senate had since approved the resignation and wished Onemola all the best in his future endeavors.
