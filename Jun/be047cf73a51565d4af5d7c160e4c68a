 After a successful debut at the British Council Lagos Theatre Festival, the Prime Theatre Workshop is set to present the stage play, Nollywood Scoundrels, at Terra Kulture Arena, Victoria Island, Lagos, from tomorrow 6th to Saturday 8th June. The play, written and directed by Olasunkanmi Adebayo, features a crop of professional and talented actors, including Opeyemi Dada, Monique Lawal, Chioma Okafor, Bamike (Bambam) Olawunmi, Gabriel Omozele, Peter Oladeji. ‘Nollywood Scoundrels’ is a play about two desperate filmmakers who must unfailingly produce a blockbuster film. To achieve this, they arrange a ‘special’ audition to find the star of their film for funding. They find the most incredible set of actors except one that gives them the shock of their lives. ‘Nollywood Scoundrels’ is a breathtaking and hilarious satirical comedy. It is fast paced and laced with humuor, rhythm and mind blowing performances, and featuring highly professional and talented actors.
