The Super Eagles were unable to win their final 2019 Africa Cup of Nations friendly as they lost 1-0 to Terenga Lions of Senegal on Sunday evening.  The match was played behind closed doors in Ismailia, Egypt four days to the opening match of the tournament. Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye scored the only goal of the game in the first half.  A defensive mix-up in the 20th minute exposed the Eagles’ defence and Gueye capitalized on it to score the only goal of the match. Daniel Akpeyi started in goal for the Super Eagles with Jamilu Collins, Kenneth Omeruo, William Ekong and Samuel Kalu in defence.  Captain Mikel Obi was joined in the midfield by John Ogu, Wilfred Ndidi and Alex Iwobi, while Samuel Chukwueze paired Odion Ighalo in the attack.  Ola Aina, Oghenekaro Etebo, Henry Onyekuru, Moses Simon, Victor Osimhen and Chidozie Awaziem replaced Collins, Ogu, Chukwueze, Iwobi, Ighalo and Kalu respectively Nigeria came close to drawing level with Odion Ighalo and Wilfred Ndidi almost scoring before half-time.  Samuel Chukwueze also came close with his shot blocked with a last-ditch tackle and substitute Oghenekaro Etebo’s free kick on the edge of the box rattled the cross bar.  The Eagles have not secured a victory in their last two friendly games, drawing 0-0 against Zimbabwe in Asaba before jetting off to Egypt.  The 2013 champions will be hoping to return to winning ways when they play their opening game against debutants Burundi on June 22. Gernot Rohr and his squad will now depart for Alexandria, ahead of their opening fixture and will also take on Guinea and Madagascar in Group B.  The Super Eagles are returning to the AFCON for the first time since their 2013 triumph, having failed to qualify in 2015 and 2017.
