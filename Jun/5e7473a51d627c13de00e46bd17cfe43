…as Flying Eagles arrive Lodz Flying Eagles coach, Paul Aigbogun, has said the team’s round of 16 encounter against fellow Africans, Senegal will be a tough one as the two sides square up on Monday evening in Lodz, Poland at the on-going FIFA U-20 World Cup. The Nigerian side scaled through to the knock out round of the championship as one of the best losers and will face the Terangas who finished top of their group. Speaking from Poland, Aigbogun said they are going to respect their opponents but agreed that it is going to be a difficult match. The coach conceded that their opponents are a good side but assured that his boys will be at their best for the game. “It is going to be Africa to Africa and in this one as you have said, they are good side we will show them respect, but we won’t fear them and I am sure they will look at us too same way,” he said. “We have known each other in the previous tournament, we watched them play and again we know that we have to be at our best during the game. “They are a good team any team you meet now in the tournament is going to be tough opposition,” he said. Meanwhile, Nigeria’s U-20 team delegation arrived in the city of Lodz on Saturday afternoon, ahead of tomorrow’s Round of 16 clash.
Players and officials left their Qubus Hotel in Bielsko-Biala after breakfast and arrived in Poland’s third largest city just in time for lunch at the Hotel Ambasador Premium. Nigeria finished third in Group D and only qualified as one of the best four third-place finishers in the six groups, while Senegal, Africa’s vice champions, finished at the top of Group A after two wins and a draw. The seven-time African champions are yet to truly impress in Poland since their opening day 4-0 lashing of Qatar in Tychy, as they lost their second game 2-0 to USA before forcing Ukraine to a 1-1 draw in their final group game.
