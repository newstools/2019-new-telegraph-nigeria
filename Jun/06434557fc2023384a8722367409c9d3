The House of Representatives yesterday mandated the Inspector General of Police, Muhammed Adamu, to put an end to banditry in Oyo communities. This followed the passage of a motion under matters of urgent public importance sponsored by Hon. Ajibola Muraina (PDPOyo), on the need to address the issues of kidnapping and banditry in Oyo State. The motion, which was not debated, was unanimously adopted by members when it was put to a voice vote by the Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila. The speaker consequently mandated the Clerk of the House, Mr Patrick Giwa, to write a letter to the Inspector General of Police, Muhammed Adamu, to combat crime in the troubled areas. It also mandated the Clerk to write to the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), to compensate those that have suffered losses as a result of criminal activities. The House of Representatives urged the Secretary to Government of the Federation (SGF), to compel the Ecological Office to intervene in the flood ravaged areas in Bende Federal Constituency of Abia State. Another area the Ecological Office is expected to intervene in is Obio Akpor in Rivers State. This followed the approval of a motion brought to the floor of the chambers by Hon. Benjamin Okezie Kalu (APC, Abia). Being an infrastructure related motion, it was not debated.
