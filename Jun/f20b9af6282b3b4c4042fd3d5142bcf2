Coordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme, Prof Charles Dokubo, at the weekend, said that the recent death of his elder sister, Madam Amaro Roseline Dokubo, had caused him an eternal pain. Describing his late sister as a mother and friend, Dokubo, on Saturday, lamented at her funeral ceremony in Abonnema, Akuku-Toru Local Government Area of Rivers State, that until her death, Amaro stood by him through thick and thin. Dokubo, in a tribute before her body was interred, said: “Sister Ama, I know you are at peace where you are and there is no need for tears. I know how much tears I shed on the day of your death, when I received the phone call that you had passed on. As I stood motionless in my office, consumed with grief, the tears kept rolling, giving me a feeling of emptiness of heart. I realised that a pain has come that will never go away and I must own that you have gone forever.” While recalling her care and love for her siblings and family members, he said: “For me, your younger brother, you always shared in my joys, sorrows, laughter, tears and successes; an inspiration from my tender age to my adulthood, up to the time you departed. You are gone but there is a place deep down in my heart where God has placed a love for you. My beloved sister, you will remain there forever.” Dokubo said he considered himself lucky to have had a loving, caring and supportive sister like Madam Amaro. “I will miss our little talks, our uncommon jokes, your comforting and reassuring voice; your inspirational words of wisdom, guidance and advice,” he added.  Until her death on April 11, in Abuja, at the age of 73, Amaro presided over a flourishing business empire with diverse interests and was also a contractor to local and multinational firms as well as Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in Rivers State. She was also a respected community and religious leader.
