The National Think Tank Committee (NTTC) and National Executive Committee (NEC) members of the Action Alliance (AA) have suspended the party’s National Chairman, Mr. Kenneth Udeze and the National Secretary, Mr. James Vernimbe. Action Alliance is the party, Chief Uche Nwosu, son-in-law of the former Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha, contested for the governorship of Imo State. The party members also asked the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) to put their searchlight into the party by investigating the suspended party leaders over the over N100 million that accrued to the party during elections. According to the members, the suspended executive had acted unilaterally in violation of the party’s constitution. The Acting National Chairman of the party, Alhaji Mohammed Abubakar, who briefed the press in Abuja after the meeting of the executive committee, said the party was still behind it’s governorship candidate in Imo State, Chief Uche Nwosu, in the last election on his petition against the result of the governorship election in the state won by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Emeka Ihedioha. According to Abubakar, the statement of the suspended AA National Chairman that the party was not in support of Nwosu going to the election tribunal to challenge the outcome of Imo State governorship election was not true.
