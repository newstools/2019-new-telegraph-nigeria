Known for his controversial lifestyle, MMMG boss, Ubi Franklin, was one of the trending topics on social media this week after claiming to have earned N10 billion in the last seven years alone. The 33-year-old and former partner of musician, Iyanya, stated this in an interview on Business Day, saying: “From 2012 till yesterday (2019), I’ve made N10 billion.” It is a claim many Nigerians on social media didn’t only find shocking; they find it hard to believe a word of it according to reactions across social media. However, later on Wednesday, the music executive retracted what he said in the televised interview with Business Day. This came after Sandra Iheuwa, a woman who recently claimed to be pregnant for him, expressing disbelief at the claim. Reacting through her Instagram account, she said she hates liars before while urging him to come up with proof. “One thing I hate in this life are liars!!! I will be waiting. The proof is in the pudding,” the lady who also accused Ubi Franklin of owing her not long ago, wrote. Getting the message, Franklin posted his own message, changing his stance a bit as he said he conducted transactions worth the said amount rather than earning it as profit. “Watch my full interview with @businessdayng And learn. And yes in the last 8 years in all sectors we have transacted such amount and I did not say 10bn was profit. And if you doubt this, I can’t argue with you at all lol,” he wrote. During the interview, he also stated that his only regret in life is his crashed marriage to actress, Lilian Esoro, which produced a child.
