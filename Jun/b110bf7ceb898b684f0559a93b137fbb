The Netherlands confirmed their place in the World Cup knockout stage with a game to spare as they beat Cameroon at the Stade du Hainaut in Valenciennes. Arsenal’s Vivianne Miedema, 22, became the European champions’ all-time top scorer as she registered her 59th and 60th international goals to eclipse Manon Melis’ record in just her 77th cap.  Miedema headed Sarina Wiegman’s side ahead as she met Lyon winger Shanice van de Sanden’s cross after 41 minutes, but Cameroon were level just 154 seconds later through Gabrielle Onguene.  Roared on by more than 10,000 fans, the Dutch made amends swiftly after half-time as Cameroon’s failure to clear a free-kick allowed Arsenal midfielder Dominique Bloodworth to convert. Miedema then ensured the victory, and qualification, as she cut inside from the left before unleashing a powerful shot beyond goalkeeper Annette Ngo Ndom with five minutes remaining.
