The Benue State government yesterday ordered immediate past local government chairmen in the state to return all official vehicles in their custody to the Directors General Services and Administration (DGSAs) in the state.  The order, which was transmitted to the former chairmen through the Bureau for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs (BLGCA), requested the Directors General Services and Administration (DGSAs) in all councils in the state to comply with the directive of the State Executive Council (SEC).  In a statement by the Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the Bureau, Ahangba Ayati, said the government had earlier directed all council chairmen, whose tenure of office just ended a few weeks ago to return all official vehicles attached to them while they served their various councils.  According to the statement, the chairmen were only ‘allowed to leave office with their official Toyota Corolla cars given to them in accordance with laid down procedure.’  Ayati, who enjoined all DGSAs to comply with the order, said further that the request was based on the directive handed down by the State Executive Council before its dissolution on May 27, 2019.
