Sat Guru Maharaj ji, the founder of the One Love Family, has called on President Muhammed Buhari to appoint him as his ‘spiritual adviser.’ Maharaj ji made the request during a press conference to mark the 26 years ‘Anniversary Celebrations of Nigeria Declaration as the new Holy Land of the Universe.’ He said among his expectations was for the president to appoint him to oversee the ministries of water resources, agriculture, and oil and gas in Mr Buhari’s second term. The cleric advised the federal government to reveal the names of those involved in the mismanagement of funds of some privatised Nigerian companies, including Nigerian Airways, Ajaokuta Steel, Delta Steel, Nigeria Electric Power Authority among others.
