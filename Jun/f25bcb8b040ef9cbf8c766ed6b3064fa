Authorities of Edo State University, Iyamho, yesterday denied the report that the operational licence of the institution had been withdrawn by the National Universities Commission (NUC) effective from the 2019/2020 academic session.  The denial followed the confusion that trailed the report in the state, leading to heightened anxiety as to the fate of the over 5, 000 students of the institution. But the university authority in a swift reaction denied the report, which it said had emanated from the social media. Registrar of the University, Dr. (Mrs.) Isoken Ogboro, descried the report as false, baseless and unfounded. She said the attention of the management of Edo University, Iyamho, had been drawn to a news item being peddled in some social media platforms.  Ogboro said: “The university management wishes to inform the general public, parents, students and prospective applicants that the information being peddled is false, baseless and unfounded. The university is running.”  According to her, “Admission for the 2019/2020 academic session is currently ongoing.” The university management advised “prospective applicants to visit the university website; www. edouniversity.edu.ng for information and enquiries.”  The statement said; “The university authority wishes to use this medium to call on the general public to disregard the fake news aimed at tarnishing the image and name the university has built over the last few years of its existence. It is on record that Edo University, Iyamho, is one of the fastest growing universities in Nigeria.”
