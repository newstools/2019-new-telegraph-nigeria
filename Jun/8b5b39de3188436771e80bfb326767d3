 Super Eagles captain Mikel Obi has said they can win the 2019 African Cup of Nations slated to begin in Egypt later in the month if they remain one of the fittest sides in the competition.
Mikel said the Super Eagles squad that won the tournament in 2013 were not regarded as favourites but they achieved the success because they worked so hard and the former Chelsea midfielder has charged the current team to follow in the foot steps of their predecessors.
”Well, I think obviously fitness is going to play a big part in this tournament, it always does when it comes to African football, fitness always plays 80 percent part in who wins the tournament,” he told a press conference on Thursday.
”If you look back at 2013 when we won it, we were one of the fittest teams, we were well drilled, we put in the hard work during the camp, we knew exactly what we were doing. We were really fit.
”That’s what we are doing now, training twice a day. If you want to win this trophy you have to do things like that.
”I am happy that every player in this team want to do it, we want to achieve the same thing, we want to be in the finals and win the tournament but we also need to know we are not the outright favorite, we have to remain cool, calm, just do what we have to do, not look at other teams.”
”If we do that, we’ll keep winning games. Experience also plays a big part; sometimes youthfulness also plays a big part.”
He said they had a good mixture of experience and youthfulness, which would help them achieve their goal.
”We have got a very good mixture in this team that’s going to help us. We have a very young team, they are all fit,” he said.
Mikel will play his 21st game at the Africa Cup of Nations if he is selected in the squad for Nigeria’s opener against Burundi on June 22.
