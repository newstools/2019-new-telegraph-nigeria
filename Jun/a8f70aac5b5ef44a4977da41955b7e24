A stressed Naomi Osaka conceded she crumbled under the weight of expectation at the French Open but claimed a third-round defeat to Katerina Siniakova was “the best thing that could’ve happened”. Osaka arrived at Roland Garros as world number one and the winner of the last two grand slams but departed seemingly a broken woman, with a stress-induced headache contributing to an error-strewn 6-4 6-2 defeat to the Czech. Asked if nerves had played a part in a fairly miserable Paris experience, she said: “Yeah, I would say that, but at the same time I don’t want to blame how I played on that. “But, yeah, definitely I think this tournament I have had a feeling that was different to every other grand slam that I have played. I just feel like there has been a weight on me.
“Usually I find it very freeing and fun, and this time around I was kind of tense the entire time. “Today I felt very tired. And the other matches too, I had this headache but I didn’t feel tired. “So I’m thinking the headache is just my stress. So it just kept staying because I don’t really get sick like that.” Meanwhile, Serena Williams’ bid to win a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title was thwarted again on Saturday when she was knocked out of the French Open 6-2, 7-5 by US compatriot Sofia Kenin in the third round. It was 37-year-old Serena’s earliest exit at the Slams since a third round loss to Alize Cornet at Wimbledon in 2014. Kenin, the 20-year-old world No 35, will face eighth seed Ashleigh Barty of Australia for a place in the quarter-finals. Three-time Roland Garros champion Williams was attempting to equal Margaret Court’s record of 24 majors.
