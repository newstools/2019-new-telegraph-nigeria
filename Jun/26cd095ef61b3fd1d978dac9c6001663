 The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has opposed a motion for joinder by Oando Plc in a suit filed by the oil firm’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Jubril Adewale Tinubu and his Deputy, Mr. Omomafe Boyo, to challenge the sanctions imposed on them by the apex capital market regulator.
Tinubu and Boyo had dragged SEC to a Federal High Court in Lagos on the heels of the punishments meted out to them by SEC for alleged infractions.
The duo had already secured an interim order restraining SEC from enforcing any of the sanctions.
At the resumed hearing of the matter yesterday, Oando’s lawyer, Yele Delano (SAN) informed Justice Ayokunle Faji of the company’s intention to be joined in the suit as well as seeking a consolidation of similar suits, pending before the court.
He then sought an adjournment to enable him file his processes in the suit.
Responding SEC’s lawyer, Chief Tony Idigbe (SAN) expressed his opposition to Oando’s request saying it will pre-determine his client’s case.
He further noted that the issue of application consolidation was intended to frustrate the case, thereby elongating the hearing of the case.
He alleged that the application for consolidation was a mere expression as the party in question has not formally processed the application.
On his part, applicants’ lawyer, Tayo Oyetibo (SAN) argued in favour of the request for joinder and urged the court to allow the party seeking to be joined in the suit.
He opined that should the court refused the application for joinder, and the party goes on to appeal, the applicants’ case might be affected.
After listening to the submissions of parties, Justice Faji fixed July 4 as the date to hear arguments on the motion for consolidation, and July 22, for hearing of the substantive suit.
