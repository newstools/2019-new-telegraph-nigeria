Youth groups from communities making up Bakassi Local Government Area of Cross River State have written to President Muhammadu Buhari demanding for compensation for the loss of their fatherland.  The youth groups told the President to commence financial and infrastructural compensation to Bakassi people, saying the area had been left without Federal Government attention while other equally affected part in the North were being rebuilt. In a letter dated May 31, 2019 and made available to New Telegraph in Calabar and titled;  “A Letter of Demand,” the youth groups said the ceding of the oil rich peninsula to Cameroon in 2002 had caused untold hardship to them. The letter reads in part: “We demand as a matter of urgency, that the issue of boundary delineation be reviewed. The boundary review must include the so-called boundary adjustment between Cross River and Akwa Ibom in relation to the 76 oil wells.
