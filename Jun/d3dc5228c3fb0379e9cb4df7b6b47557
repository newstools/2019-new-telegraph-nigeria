A group known as All Progressives Congress (APC) Stakeholders Forum has protested some  appointments made by Senate President Ahmad Lawan. Lawan appointed Festus Adebayo, columnist, as his media adviser. The senate president also retained Olu Onemola and Tope Olowoyeye, aides of Bukola Saraki, his predecessor. The appointments have generated controversy, especially online. Speaking with journalists in Abuja on Thursday, Abu Andrew, forum’s spokesman, said the appointments  are glaring reward to people who have insulted President Muhammadu Buhari. “When the senate president we all supported with our hearts and worked for wholeheartedly begins to compensate enemies of the government, those of the party and indeed those of the same President Buhari who endured insults for backing Senator Lawan for Senate President position; then the devil himself must be celebrated for doing a good job in turning a Senate President we brought in against us so soon and so fast,” Andrew said. “No doubt, the appointments are glaring reward for people who have not only insulted the person of President Muhammadu Buhari but also severally maligned the integrity of the office he occupies, “Even for supporting Senator Lawan to be senate president, these new appointees did not spare the president. “Now that senator Lawan has achieved his ambition, it’s disheartening to see that the very people he puts forward as beneficiaries of his new position are those who condemned and vilified those who supported him to attain the position in the first place.” On his part, Ayo Oyalowo, a member of the group, said it is not possible to work with people who do not believe in your agenda. “It is not about appointments as it were, it is about the fact that there is an agenda called – initially the change agenda now the next level agenda,” Oyalowo said.
