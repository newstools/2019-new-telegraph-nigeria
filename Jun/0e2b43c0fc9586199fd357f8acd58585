Super Eagles have brushed aside flu attacks to intensify training ahead of their Africa Cup of Nations opening encounter with Burundi on Saturday.
Players and officials of the Super Eagles have played down the incessant flu that has plagued the camp in recent days as they continued their preparations according to authoritative source from their camp.
Despite media fears that a host of players could be forced to sit out the opening game, the team set out in their usual mood as they trained lightly on Tuesday before going in for an official photo session with the likes of Alex Iwobi and Ola Aina wearing plenty of smiles during the session.
However, the team’s media officer, Toyin Ibitoye,who confirmed this said that the whole situation were being overhyped as the players were focused on the task ahead.
“Nothing to it. Some players had a common cold, cough and flu, even officials too but it didn’t stop anything as they are sensationalizing it,” Ibitoye stated.
Having failed to qualify for the last two editions, the Eagles will be hoping to start on a winning note after being dubbed by bookmakers as favourites to top Group B.
