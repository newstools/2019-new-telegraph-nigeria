On a recent episode of The Jim Bakker Show, host Jim Bakker returned to one of his favorite conspiracy theories, which involves various assassination plots planned by liberals targeting Christian leaders and politicians who support President Trump.
Bakker declared that Trump was elected because “God’s people” went to the polls and voted, and the “enemies of the gospel know it,” during a monologue to his audience. “I’m going to say something I probably shouldn’t say,” Bakker warned in a video clip flagged by Right Wing Watch. “What’s coming next, if we keep losing, you’re going to see the leaders of the church and the leaders of the gospel and the political conservative leaders that are powerful, you are going to see them suddenly die, suddenly killed—suddenly as they were driving, suddenly as they were in a boat, suddenly in an airplane—you’re going to see it one after another.” Bakker went on to say that God warned him about this eventuality years ago, adding that he believes “we’re in that time” where life on earth is about to end.
“This is life and death,” he said.
Bakker has warned about the impending deaths of Christians at the hands of anti-Trump forces before. In August of last year, he lamented that his support for Trump has put his life at risk. “The evil in this country is so bad, if I was a Republican—which I have been my whole life—I couldn’t wear a hat with my candidate on it without concern about being murdered in the street,” Bakker said. The month before, while discussing a pro-life movie about abortion, Bakker said, “I’ve been hesitating to tell you what’s going to come next … but they’re gonna begin to kill the Christian leaders in this country.”
