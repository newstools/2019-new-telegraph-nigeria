 President of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), Ahmad Ahmad, has called for the emergency meeting of the Executive Committee of CAF due to the crisis that happened at the final of this year’s Champions League final between Esperance of Tunisia and Morocco’s Wydad Casablanca on Friday. Esperance won the CAF Champions League in Tunisia, after Wydad Casablanca refused to continue playing on 60 minutes because VAR (video assistant referee) was unavailable to judge a disallowed equaliser. The Tunisian side were leading 1-0 in the second leg of the final and 2-1 overall when play was halted, and after a 90-minute delay the referee awarded the match to the home side. Tunisian media reported that officials were aware before the match that the VAR system was not working, but the players seemingly did not know. It is the first time in the 55-year history of the elite African club competition that a match in the home-and-away final series has not been completed. Wydad believed they had levelled on 59 minutes when Walid el Karti headed a cross into the net. TV replays confirmed he was onside, but might have fouled an opponent with his shoulder.
The Moroccan team insisted that the Gambian referee check with VAR, apparently unaware that the often controversial system was unavailable. Wydad substitutes and 69-year-old coach Faouzi Benzarti joined in the protests and police foiled an attempted assault by a spectator wearing the red and gold of Esperance. Following the event and after the match was stopped, CAF President, Ahmad decided to call an Emergency Executive Committee on June 4 to discuss regulatory issues to avert such a scenario in the future.
