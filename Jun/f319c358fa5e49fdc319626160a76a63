Assistant-Inspector-General of Police (AIG) in charge of Zone 2, Shehu Lawal, yesterday declared that the police were battle ready for herdsmen in Lagos and Ogun states.
Lawal disclosed this while parading some suspects at the Zone 2 headquarters. The AIG disclosed that activities of herdsmen had become a serious concern to everyone.
He said: “There is no place for criminals or herdsmen in Lagos and Ogun states. Operation Puff Adder will check all forms of criminality in the zone. Indeed, some suspects were recently arrested at Imeko area of Ogun State.
“I’m sending warning to herdsmen who want to commit any crime in Lagos and Ogun states to relocate. We’re battle ready for them. We urge members of the public to give us information in time of crisis. The Puff Adder, which was recently launched by both Lagos and Ogun commands, is aimed at fighting violent crimes, including the menace of herdsmen/farmers crises, kidnapping, armed robbery, cultism, banditry, land grabbing, rape, among others.”
According to the AIG, in order to avoid breakdown of laws and order, a visible patrol team has been deployed to the Lagos-Sagamu interchange, especially on the Kara long bridge, which was notorious for armed robbery.
However, Lawal assured residents of Lagos and Ogun states of adequate security during the Sallah holidays and after.
Speaking on negative stories in the social media, the AIG appealed to members of the public to verify stories before posting or sharing. He noted that false information could cause bigger crisis if not properly managed.
