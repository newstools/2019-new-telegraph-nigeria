 Former Super Eagles midfielder, Mutiu Adepoju, has warned the current set of players in Nigeria’s national team that they will have to work hard and put in extra effort for them to emerge as champions of Africa for the fourth time.
Speaking of his impressions of the Eagles’ build-up to this year’s Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, Adepoju acknowledged that the Nigerian side was star-studded, but he further pointed out that every other team heading to The Land of The Pharaohs was equally well stocked and eager to win.
The ex Compotella and Real Sociedad of Spain star stated: “We have good players; the expectation is for them to go there and win the cup.
“However, we should note that other countries too also want to win it. So, we have to try very hard, to win it.
“It’s not enough for us to praise our players and keep mentioning their names, they have to put in hard work and efforts to win the cup.”
Adepoju, who is now an ambassador for Spain’s top-flight league, La Liga, in Nigeria, added that the Eagles cannot afford to relax against any of their group opponents, not even the debuting Burundi and Madagascar.
He stressed that, since the Eagles’ squad is star studded, the realistic expectation from every Nigeria is that their team will go all the way to the title in Egypt, but concluded with a terse warning that it takes more than names to win matches.
