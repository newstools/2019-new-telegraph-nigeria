Nigerian tennis team to the first ever Africa Beach Games in Cape Verde ended their campaign on a good note winning a silver medal at the championship.
The team handled by former national Davis Cup player Abdulmumini Babalola recorded a two straight sets victory over Algeria in the womenâ€™s doubles category on Sunday.
The team, comprising Christy Agugbom and Blessing Samuel, combined excellently to ease to a 6-2, 6-3 victory over the Algerian pair of Boudjadi Hanine and Felloussa Amina and cap off an impressive beach tennis outing on the island of Sal.
The victory gave Nigeria four points as they claimed the silver medal, having won two out of three matches. Morocco clinched the gold medal, following their final victory over host nation, Cape Verde, who finished in third place.
Nigeria had lost to Morocco on the first day, but bounced back strongly against Cape Verde in their second match, where they rallied from a set down to secure a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory.
Meanwhile, Algeria finished bottom of the log, having not won a single match.
The Africa Beach Games, which got under way on June 14, has a thousand athletes from 54 African nations.
