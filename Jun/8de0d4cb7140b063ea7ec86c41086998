He lamented that for long, Ogoni had been in bondage searching for work. He called on the new oil company not to ignite fight because of Ogoni oil, but pledged his full support to the oil company in its operations. Gininwa also promised to privately meet with President Muhammadu Buhari to inform him that the Ogoni have formed their oil company that would begin oil exploration in Ogoniland. Gininwa said: “The problem I have is that our people are not doing business. We should be business minded. We should also be united. Don’t go and kill yourselves because of Ogoni oil. “I support the formation of Ogoni Oil Company. My job is to stay as a father to the company and I will not regret it. If NDPC is looking for people to be their contractor, you should be the first. I am happy that Ogoni people have come into this business. “We have been in bondage. Our children have been going to other places for work, now that opportunity has come, what we want is good arrangement, so you will not fail.
