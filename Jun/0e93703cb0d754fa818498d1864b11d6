Operatives of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) have arrested a six-man syndicate impersonating the Primate, Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Rev Nicholas Okoh, and other top clerics. The ICPC spokesperson, Mrs. Rasheedat Okoduwa, made the disclosure in a statement.  Okoduwa said the members of the syndicate, who were arrested in Kaduna State, specialised in perpetrating the crime through a fake Facebook account. She said: “Six members of a cybercrime syndicate have been arrested by the ICPC for impersonating the Primate of the Anglican Communion, Rev Nicholas Okoh. The syndicate, allegedly led by Jehu Kwasu, was arrested in Kaduna, for using a fake Facebook account of the reverend to defraud unsuspecting members of the public of several millions of naira.  “Investigation by ICPC revealed that the syndicate posts fictitious distress stories on the fake Facebook account to con prominent citizens, top government officials and politicians into believing that it was Rev Okoh that was making the plea for help. The commission further found out that the group was also impersonating other top clerics of the Anglican Communion, such as Bishops Zakari Nyam, Moleku and Lamido to commit their nefarious acts.” According to her, the suspects have made useful statements, even as five of them have been granted administrative bail. She added: “Five of the suspects are currently on administrative bail from the commission, leaving only Kwasu, who is yet to meet his bail conditions. It is noteworthy that the suspects have made useful statements to the commission and will be charged to court soon after the conclusion of investigation.”
