Media practitioners in Niger State at the weekend tasked the state government on open defecation, urging the government to save the state from disease outbreak by building toilets and conveniences in strategic public places, especially at the Mobil Roundabout so as to discourage open defecation. Members of the fourth estate of the realm drawn from various media organisations while saying they would champion campaigns and enlightenment programmes in the state, called for re-introduction of the monthly environmental sanitation exercise in the state.  In a communiqué issued at the end of a threeday media roundtable meeting on enhancing media participation in urban wash issues organised by the Niger State Water Board (NSWB) in collaboration with USAID, the government was charged to declare a state of emergency on the State Environmental Protection Agency (NISEPA). According the communiqué signed by participants, the media called on the state government to as a matter of urgency increase funding for NISEPA to enable it carry out its mandate.
