Operatives of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps(NSCDC) have arrested one of the bomb material suppliers of Boko Haram in Maiduguri, Borno State. According to NSCDC, the suspect, Aliyu Muhammed (24), a suspected Boko Haram Improvised Explosive Device(IED) logistics supplier in Maiduguri, was arrested on his way to supply some bomb materials to the dreaded Islamic sect. The Commandant of the corps, Ibrahim Abdullahi, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in Maiduguri. Abdullahi said that the suspect was nabbed by men of the command on April 25, following intelligence report while he was on his way to supply bomb materials for Boko Haram terrorists. He said that preliminary investigation conducted by the command, revealed that the suspect supplied mobile phones battery, wrist watches as well as laptop computers used for setting off IEDs designed to inflict massive casualties. The Commandant said: “The suspect, who pretended to be a tricycle operator in the town, has executed many missions for the insurgents. He also operates several bank accounts, where he receives funds from Boko Haram in the last six months. He usually receives large sums of money from the Republic of Chad, through a third party account number to avoid being detected. We have so far tracked dozens of his transactions, especially at commercial money transfer centers within Maiduguri.”
