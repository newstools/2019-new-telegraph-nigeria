A few weeks after it announced the blacklisting of a Nigerian construction firm for allegedly engaging in numerous acts of fraud in bidding for a construction contract, the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group has hammered another Nigerian firm for a similar offence.
In a press release posted on its website yesterday, the AfDB announced that it has blacklisted Abuja-based construction firm Oceanic Construction and Engineering Nigeria for a minimum period of 48 months for fraudulent contract bidding.
According to the press release:” An investigation conducted by the Bank’s Office of Integrity and Anti-Corruption established that the company misrepresented its year of incorporation, the value of its reference contracts, and the experience of its key personnel while bidding for two works contracts under the Bank-financed Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Improvement Project in Nigeria.”
It explained that the project was aimed at enhancing access to safe water supply services in Oyo and Taraba States through, among other components, extension and rehabilitation works on the water transmission and distribution network.
It further stated that: “The debarment, pronounced by the independent Sanctions Commissioner of the Bank, renders Oceanic Construction and Engineering Nigeria ineligible to participate in Bank-financed projects during the debarment period. The debarment qualifies for cross-debarment by other multilateral development banks under the Agreement for Mutual Enforcement of Debarment Decisions, including the Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank Group.
“At the expiry of the debarment period, Oceanic Construction and Engineering Nigeria shall be eligible again to participate in Bank-financed projects only conditional on the implementation of an integrity compliance program consistent with its guidelines,” it added. On June 4, the AfDB announced that it had barred a Nigerian construction company, Qualitrends Global Solutions Nigeria Limited’, for 36 months allegedly engaging in numerous acts of fraud in bidding for a construction contract. The Office of Integrity and Anti-Corruption of the AfDB is responsible for preventing, deterring and investigating allegations of corruption, fraud and other sanctionable practices in operations financed by the Bank.
