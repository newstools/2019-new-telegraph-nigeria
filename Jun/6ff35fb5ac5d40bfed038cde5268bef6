Nigeria’s only individual gold medalist at the Olympics, Chioma Ajunwa, has reiterated her resolve in contributing her own quota as Nigeria moves forward in actualising a drug free society. Speaking during a conference organised by her foundation, Chioma Ajunwa Foundation, with the theme: ‘Drug Abuse and No Tobacco Conference 2019’, for the country’s athletes and other youth, Ajunwa said she derived the motivation from her bitter experience.  “My inspiration is from a bitter experience I had having been caught up in the web of this deadly manance,” she said.  “Our youths should have the singular opportunity of understanding the adverse negative effects of drug taking. “We need to continually bring to the awareness of our young boys and girls especially those that can be easily influenced by peer pressure, and the negative turn around it deposits in one’s life.”
