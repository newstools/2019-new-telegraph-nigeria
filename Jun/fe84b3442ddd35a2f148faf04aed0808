The Bling Lagosians, the latest movie from the stables of Bolanle Austen Peters Productions, is set for the cinemas from Friday, June 28, following a screening at Kulture Arena earlier this week. The movie, which tells in a moving manner the story of a wealthy Lagos family, with an enduring and colourful history of wealth and an ancestral name, would resonate with many Lagosians. Bolanale Austen Peters, who directed the flick, aptly described the story as that of Nigerians. “In telling this story, it was important that we learnt lessons. In doing the Bling Lagosians, I observed certain things in our society and I decided to tell the story, a relatable story, that people would see and recognise this is the real us. This story is like a mirror, so we can look at ourselves in a mirror and see the flaws. This is a story of deceit, lust, love, greed, passion, it’s a story of excess’ but with redeeming qualities,” she said. Starring notable figures like Elvina Ibru (Mrs. Modelola Holloway), Winihin Jemide, Monalisa Chinda, Bisola Aiyeola, Tana Adelana, Osas Ighodaro Ajibade, Helen Paul, Alex Ekugbo, Gbenga Titiloye (Akin Holloway ), Brother Shaggi, among others, will surely excite movie lovers.
