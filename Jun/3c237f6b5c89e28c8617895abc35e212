The Nigeria side need a point against France on Monday evening to qualify for the round of 16 and the coach said the team must give it their all at the 28,000-capacity Roazhon Park in Rennes.  Dennerby, who took his charges through a pre-match final training session on Sunday at the Stade Edmund Blanchet, reiterated that a positive mindset, as well as a calm and collected approach can work wonders for the Falcons against the French.  “This is an important match for us and I believe you can rise to the occasion just as you did against the Koreans,” the Swede said.  “The French have a good team but we are also a good squad and I think we can get a result if we have that mindset that it is eleven players against eleven and we stick to our tactics for the day. “Victory against the Koreans was very good. But I can assure that beating France would be even sweeter.”  Oparanozie, Rita Chikwelu and Francisca Ordega are all in danger of missing out on the Round of 16 if they are cautioned against the Les Bleues on Monday.

We will go in there against France and give our best, and we are confident that our best will be good enough to take us to the next round.”
