The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kano State yesterday accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of violating orders of the court which instructed the commission to allow the party access to electoral materials. In a petition filed before the Kano Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in the state, PDP accused INEC and the Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state, Prof. Risqua Shehu Arabic, of contempt of court and failure to meet his schedules. The tribunal on May 7, 2019 granted PDP access to inspect electoral materials and obtain same for the purpose of maintaining and defending their petition as per the list of documents attached in the schedule. Counsel to PDP, Bashir Umar, urged all parties involved, including APC, INEC, PDP to draft a schedule within which the inspection of materials would take place. He regretted that INEC had slowed down the process of issuance of electoral materials while also failing to meet the May 22, 2019 deadline.
