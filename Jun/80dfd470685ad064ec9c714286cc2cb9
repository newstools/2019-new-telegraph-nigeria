Girl-child activists have renewed fight against the continued sexual molestation and abuse of underage girls in the country, saying it is a menace that is capable of intimidating and limiting the girl-child holistic development.  The activists, who also called on government and all relevant stakeholders to invest in the development of the girl-child, also stated that girls need a conducive environment to grow into responsible women. One of such activists, the founder of Helpline Foundation for the Needy, Dr. Jumai Ahmadu, said the girl-child cannot maximise fully the potential embedded in her, if sexual predators were allowed to continue to prey on her with all manner of violation.  Ahmadu spoke at the plenary of 2019 Voice of the Girls’ Parliament, organised in Abuja by her foundation in collaboration with the Social Development Secretariat of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), as a platform for the girls to express themselves and also interface with the older generation.  Ahmad said: “For us to have an empowered woman, we have to start from the cradle so they have value for themselves and be truly independent. Building up a woman is a task that requires time and commitment; therefore, it is a wise step to begin early. “Following the popular phrase ‘catch them young’ we advocate the foundation of building a generation of strong, dependable, strong-willed and innovative women, be laid from now in the hearts of our young girls. “We should be mindful of the fact that we all have a role to play in the physical development and mental development of our girls if they must grow up to be strong women. “If we want them to be able to stand up and speak for themselves in the face of bullies, sexual opportunists, teacher-female student oppression and other environmental challenges the girl-child is prone to face.
