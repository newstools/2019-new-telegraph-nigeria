Real Madrid have signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea on a fiveyear contract. The 28-year-old will be officially unveiled on Thursday, June 13, once he has undergone his medical. Madrid are understood to have struck a deal with Chelsea that could rise to a club-record transfer of £130million once all bonus payments come into play. “Real Madrid CF and Chelsea FC have agreed to the transfer of the player Eden Hazard,” read a Madrid statement.  “The player remains linked to the club during the next five seasons, until June 30, 2024. “Eden Hazard will be presented as a new player of Real Madrid on Thursday June 13 at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium, after passing the relevant medical examination.”  Hazard becomes Madrid’s second major signing after Frankfurt’s Luka Jovic, in a summer of rebuilding in Zinedine Zidane’s second stint as manager at the Bernabeu. Chelsea will view the outcome of lengthy negotiations with Madrid as a success, as Real had been reluctant to pay more than £88million.  The basic fee for Hazard is expected to reach £100million, the sum for which Chelsea had been holding out despite the 28-year-old entering the final year of his Stamford Bridge contract. Hazard joined Chelsea from Lille in 2012, and went on to win two Premier League titles, one FA Cup and one League Cup – and two Europa League crowns.
