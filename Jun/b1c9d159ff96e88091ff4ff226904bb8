Traders and residents wailed loudly after a heavy rainfall that witnessed the submerging of houses and shop in Aba, Abia State. The rain was said to have lasted for six hours, destroying houses, shops and property worth millions of naira.
The flood affected major commercial areas like Ahia-Ohuru (New Market), Ariaria International Market and the Eziukwu Market.
New Telegraph gathered that Ahia-Ohuru traders were the worst hit by the flood, especially at line 10, where Mr. Obinna Ogugua, lost 32 bales of clothes worth N90,000 each.
Also, residents of Ahuronye, Nwaogu and Mathew streets in the Obuda/Eziukwu area, including those at Ohanku Road in the Ndiegoro area of the city, had to vacate their buildings as the flood invaded their homes.
Children, who were home alone, were heard crying, screaming for help. Many of them were later rescued by some Good Samaritans.
It was learnt that an old drainage, which has remained unfixed for years, forced the flood onto the fences protecting homes, forcing these houses to cave in.
The landlord of No.17, Ahuronye Street, Nze Okechukwu Egechi, said that flooding in Aba was nothing new, only that this, the level of destruction was much.
He said: “I was not around when the rain started. When I got to my area, I couldn’t enter my house; everywhere was submerged. It’s bad that we have a government representing us. They don’t respond to our calls. I couldn’t bring out anything out of my house. My children and the entire tenants in my house only picked their clothes and moved out when the rain was getting heavier. I nearly lost my 13 years old daughter. She was the last to leave the house, but fell into the flood. I know it was God that saved her. She’s not here now, because most of them are taking refuge elsewhere. When she fell into the water, she started swimming and people rushed to rescue her.”
