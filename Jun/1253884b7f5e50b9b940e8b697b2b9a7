In response to a debate online over domestic abuse in homes, brazen actress, Tonto Dikeh, has blown hot again. The Nollywood actress revealed how she dealt with her ex-hubby Olakunle Churchill when he beat her up. She got irreverent again after an Instagram user shared a post about men who abuse their wives by beating them. This provoked some nasty clamp down by Instagram users on males in that habit. Tonto Dikeh got incensed after seeing the post. According to her, after her ex-husband, Olakunle Churchill, beat her, she called him a woman and gave him a tampon. As if this was not enough, a man went on to comment about how he slapped his girlfriend twice in the face. The remorseful chap said due to this, the lady has drifted apart from him for six days. So enraged was Tonto Dikeh that she lambasted him for raising his hand to slap his woman. She went ahead to say that she hoped the lady leaves him for good.
