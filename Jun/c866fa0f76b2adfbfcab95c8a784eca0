Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has said that his administration would soon establish an anti-corruption agency. Makinde announced this at a two-day induction programme for members-elect of the 9th Assembly of Oyo State. He said the lawmakers would get a bill seeking to establish the Oyo State Anti- Corruption Agency immediately after the inauguration of the Assembly.  The governor said that when the agency was established, it would be empowered to beam its searchlight on any individual or body in the state. His Chief Press Secretary (CPS), Mr. Taiwo Adisa, quoted Makinde in a statement as saying that he would readily waive his immunity to appear before the agency if he was found not to be above board. He said: “The first Executive Bill we are bringing to you is for us to set up an Anti-Corruption Agency for Oyo State.  And I will waive  my immunity, if I am found not to be above board, to face that agency.” Makinde also explained his government’s determination to make Oyo State one of the safest in Nigeria by coming up with measures to tame insecurity. According to him, the decision to proscribe the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) a few days after taking office was borne out of the resolve to ensure that the state is not held to ransom by a few individuals.
