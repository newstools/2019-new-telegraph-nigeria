 The recent upward trend in the number of inactive bank accounts in the country continued last month as latest data released by the Nigeria Interbank Settlement System (NIBSS) shows that such accounts now stand at 49.14 million compared with 48.66 million in the previous month. A New Telegraph analysis of NIBSS’ industry customer bank account data for the month of May posted on the organization’s website at the weekend, shows that while the total number of bank accounts increased to 122.071 million at the end of May from 121.638 million in April, the total number of active bank accounts during the same period fell to 72.936 million in May from 72.977 million in the previous month. This means that the total number of inactive bank accounts in the review period increased to 49.14 million. A breakdown of the figures shows that whereas the total number of bank accounts has steadily risen this year, climbing from 118.92 million in January to 120.14 million in February; 120.92 million in March; 121.64 million in April and 122.07 million in May, the total number of active bank accounts has been on the decline in the last two months. Thus, while total active bank accounts grew from 71.79 million in January to 74.04 million in March, they fell to 72.98 million and 72.94 million in April and May respectively. According to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) guidelines: “An account shall become inactive if there has been no customer or depositor-initiated transaction for a period of six months after the last customer or depositor initiated transaction.” Further analysis of the NIBSS data also shows a steady increase in total current accounts this year as they grew from 25.97 million in January to 29.15 million in May. Similarly, since falling to 88.45 million in February from 89.67 million in January, the total number of savings accounts has risen from 89.05 million in March to 89.60 million in May. In a recent chat with New Telegraph, the President of Bank Customers’ Association of Nigeria (BCAN), Dr. Uju Ogubunka, attributed the increase in inactive bank accounts recorded in recent months to the tough economy. Ogubunka, who is a former Registrar/Chief Executive of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), said: “The truth is that cash flow in the economy is a bit tight now. People don’t use banks except they have need for them. It is obvious that the economy is passing through tough times and businesses are struggling. So if you don’t have money and you are not going to get an overdraft, why would you want to go to the bank? The increase in the number of inactive bank accounts is clearly an indication that the economy is not doing well.”
