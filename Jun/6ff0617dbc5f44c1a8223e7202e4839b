A labourer, Peace Stephen, 25 and Ibrahim Yahaya, 22, who allegedly stole rolls of cables worth N4 million, were on Thursday brought before a Tinubu Magistrates’ Court. The two defendants, whose addresses were not provided, are facing a three-count charge of conspiracy, willful damage and theft. The Prosecutor, Insp. Ben Ekundayo, told the court that the defendants committed the offences on June 7 at about 12:00a.m at Eko Atlantic City, Victoria Island, Lagos. He said that the defendants stole rolls of cables worth N4 million, property of Eko Atlantic City. Ekundayo told the court that the security guard on duty had alerted the Chief Security Officer, when he observed the duo loading the cables inside a Honda car with Registration No. LF 324 EKY. “The two defendants were apprehended and handed over to the police,” the prosecutor said. He said the offences contravened Sections 115, 287 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Sections 115 and 287 stipulate three years imprisonment for willful damage and theft respectively, while Section 411 carries two years imprisonment for conspiracy. The Magistrate, Mrs A.M. Olumide-Fusika, granted the defendants N200, 000 bail with two sureties in like sum. Olumide-Fusika held that one of the sureties must be relatives of the defendants and the other a civil servant. She adjourned the case until June 24 for mention. (NAN)
