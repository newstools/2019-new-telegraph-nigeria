The reigning Queen Moremi Ajasoro, Miss Toluhi Oreoluwa Adedamola, penultimate Monday, Children’s Day, started her books and music festival initiative with students of Queen’s Model Schools, Enugu.  The initiative which involves special book reading with students was on the theme, “Reading Maketh a Woman.” She read the book titled ‘The Legendary Queen Moremi Ajasoro’. Miss Adedamola, a former make-up artist, model and a 300-level English language student of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), defeated other 21 finalists, at the grand finale of the contest, held last year in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, to emerge winner of the 2018 edition of the Queen Moremi Ajasoro (QMA) beauty pageant. According to Adedamola, the idea behind the book reading with the students is so that they can know how strong and powerful Queen Moremi is in the Yoruba culture.  “The book reading is majorly about the story of Moremi Ajasoro as an epitome of womanhood, and to portray heroism in the Yoruba culture. It also talks about leadership.  “It is to let people know more about Moremi Ajasoro in Yoruba culture. We are also talking about leadership in general. Majorly, it focuses on womanhood – women, ladies, girl child. This is to enlighten them that they can be the best they can be if they actually put their mind to it.  “So we are going to be telling children about how strong they could be and how vast they could do whatever they are going to do,” she said.  “It will teach children how strong they can be and how vast an opportunity they have to do whatever they want to be.”  From Enugu State, the book tour, which is the result of collaboration between Save Our Children’s Tomorrow Foundation and Queen Moremi Ajasoro Initiative, will hold in Kwara State; then to Osun, Ogun, and Lagos State, respectively.  Highlights of the book reading include musical performances and interactions with the children.
