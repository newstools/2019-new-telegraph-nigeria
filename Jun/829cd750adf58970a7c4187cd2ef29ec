Acting Director General of the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, Ms. Mary Uduk, who spoke while responding to questions from journalists recently, said the outflow has led to sell pressure accumulating into depressed prices. This, she said, is one of the reasons why the Commission is mapping out strategies to build confidence in the market and encourage more retail investors. The Exchange also said that currently there are about 3 million retail investors in the Nigerian Capital Market, representing only three per cent of the total adult populace in the country. The Divisional Head, Trading Business, Mr. Jude Chiemeka, disclosed this recently at maiden edition of Retail Investor Workshop tagged “Investment Masterclass; Making your money work” organised by NSE. According to Chiemeka, “Nigeria has a population of over 190 million people and is the second largest economy in Africa. However, the current Financial Inclusion indices of 48 per cent leave much to be desired. Financial Inclusion is a priority of stakeholders in the Capital Market, and the Nigerian Stock Exchange makes it a primary concern to contribute towards the achievement of Nigeria’s National Financial Inclusion Strategy of reducing the proportion of adult Nigerians that are financially excluded to 20 per cent in the year 2020.”
