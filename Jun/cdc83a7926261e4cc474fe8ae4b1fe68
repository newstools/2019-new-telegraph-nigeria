Olubankole Wellington, Banky W, as he is popularly called lamented the decaying state of affairs in the Copyright Society of Nigeria (COSON). According to him, the leaders of the collecting society were not accountable. He gave an instance of how security expenses rose from N1m in 2017 to N31m in 2018. The singer then went on to berate the management of the society for not taking 2Baba’s call for auditing seriously.
Banky W called out the Chairman of COSON, Tony Okoroji for not paying attention to the crimes and atrocities committed within the society. Even more, he mentioned that were it not for the atrocities within the body, directors and musicians of great repute would get the good things they really deserve. In a passionate tone, Banky W went on to mention names like Id Cabasa and OJB Jezreel. For him, it was saddening that these people’s intellectual properties were not protected and harnessed to make a living for these people.
