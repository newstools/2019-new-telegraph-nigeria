Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, yesterday said that the state has been particularly identified as a peaceful place that accommodates people of different ethnicity and religious background. Ganduje made the disclosure while receiving His Royal Majesty, Dr. Appolous Chu Egbere Emere Okori Eleme I of Rivers State, who paid him a courtesy visit in his office.  The governor, represented by his Deputy, Dr. Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna, reaffirmed that his administration would continue to ensure that people in the state live peacefully with their neighbours, who were residing in the state. “Like you said, your subjects are staying here in Kano; they can testify to the peaceful atmosphere in Kano that has been created by the good determination of this administration.  “People of different ethnicity and religious backgrounds leave harmoniously with each other and I think Kano is the only state that people from outside the state owned properties and land more than any other states in the country,” he explained. He maintained that this  act of accommodating other people from outside had enabled the state to become more popular in terms of commercial activities, thereby drawing investors from other countries to Kano.  Ganduje pointed out; “There are areas that we know are occupied by people from other places that are coming in to Kano and they stay happily and we believe by doing so, they bring in their wealth, they bring in their goodwill to Kano.”  The governor further reassured the people of the state’s willingness to embrace people living in the state in respective of their social background in the interest of speedy development.  Earlier, His Royal Majesty, Dr. Appolous Chu Egbere Emere Okori Eleme I of Rivers State informed the governor that he was in office to strengthen the good friendship that exists between the people of Kano and people of Rivers State.
