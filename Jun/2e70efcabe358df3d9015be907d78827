Dr. Alex Ifeanyichukwu Ekwueme (1932-2017), from Oko, Orumba North local Government Area of Anambra State, was the Vice President of Nigeria between 1979 and 1983. Chief Edwin Ume Ezeoke (1935-2011), from Amichi, Nnewi South Local Government Area of Anambra State, was Speaker of House of representatives from 1979-1983. Professor Oluyemi Oluleke Osinbajo (62) has been Vice-President of Nigeria since 2015. He was born into the family of Opeoluwa Osinbajo, who was the late Treasurer of Our Saviours Anglican Church, Ikenne Ogun State. Professor Osinbajo was born in Creek Hospital, Lagos. The Vice President’s mother, Madam Olubisi Osinbajo’s parents are both from Ejigbo in Osun State and Ilaro in Ogun State. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Adefemi Akeem Gbajabiamila (57) was born in Surulere, Lagos. Dr. Ekwueme, Chief Ezeoke, Prof. Osinbajo and Gbajabiamila are lawyers. Incidentally, Osinbajo and Gbajabiamila are old boys of Igbobi College, Yaba, Lagos. As they say, what goes around comes around. Personal interest not regional or religious interest is the first priority of every politician. While the election of Gbajabiamila of the APC as Speaker was planned, that of Ezeoke happened by accident 40 years ago. On October 5, 1978, a meeting was held at the sixth floor at LAPAL HOUSE, at Igbosere, Lagos, which was the headquarters of Hacogen Company Limited. The company was then owned by Dr. Joseph Wayas. It was at the meeting that the National Party of Nigeria (NPN) zoned offices. The Presidency was zoned to the North while the Vice Presidency was zoned to Anambra and Imo states. The Presidency of the Senate was zoned to Bendel, Cross River and Rivers states. The chairmanship of the party was zoned to Lagos, Oyo, Ondo and Ogun states while the Speaker of the House of Representatives was zoned to the Middle Belt. At that time there were 19 states. After the August 11, 1979 election, the then Federal Electoral Commission (FEDECO), declared Shehu Shagari as President. All the four parties – UPN, NPP, GNPP and PRP – condemned the declaration. They immediately formed an alliance to show their condemnation. A press conference was called immediately at Eko Holiday Inn, Victoria Island, Lagos and was addressed by the Presidential candidate of the NPP, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe. All the other Presidential candidates, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Alhaji Waziri Ibrahim and Alhaji Aminu Kano attended the press conference. That was the last act the NPP took on the issue for the party developed cold feet thereafter. The NPP became “a beautiful pride”. The NPN dangled a carrot in front of the NPP. On August 19, 1979, the UPN filed an action at the Presidential election tribunal to protest the declaration of the Federal Electoral Commission (FEDECO) of Chief Michael Ani. The tribunal was headed by Justice Boonyami Oladiran Kazeem of the Federal Court of Appeal. On September 11, the tribunal upheld the declaration by FEDECO that Shagari was duly elected as President. Not satisfied with that judgement, the UPN led by Chief Awolowo filed an appeal at the Supreme Court. The appeal was filed on behalf of the party by Chief Godwin Ajayi. On September 26, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Shagari. Five Judges of the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Shagari while two were opposed. Those in favour were the Chief Justice of the Federation, Justice Atanda Fatai Williams, Justice Chukwuhweike Idigbe, Justice Ayo Gabriel Irekefe, Justice Mohammed Bello and Justice Mohammed Lawal Uwais. The two opposed to the judgement were Justice Kayode Eso and Justice Andew Otutu Obaseki. After the judgement of the Supreme Court, Shagari took the oath of office under a raining condition at Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos on October 1, 1979. He gave an indication shortly after that he wanted to run an all-inclusive government. The UPN led by Awolowo opted out of the arrangement by insisting that in a Presidential system of government, there was no room for an all-inclusive government. Shagari was part of the Parliamentary System of Government in the First Republic. Following the declaration by Shagari to invite the other parties to join his government, a meeting was hurriedly summoned on October 3 at the Federal Palace by the NPN National Working Committee (NWC). It was agreed at the meeting that the zoning policy of the party was to be reviewed.  At the meeting, the NPN agreed to allocate the Speakership of the House of Representatives to the NPP and the Deputy Senate Presidency as well. That was how Simeon Mbarorkaa Tarka (Gboko West), a favourite at that time lost his chance of becoming the youngest Speaker of the House of Representatives. As for the Senate Presidency, the NPN decided to hold on to that because of confirmation of ministers and ambassadors and other responsibilities allocated to the Senate by the Constitution. At the meeting two Senators-elect showed interest in the Senate Presidency. They were Chief David Omueya Dafinone, a Chartered Accountant from Bendel South who is an Urhobo and Dr. Joseph Wayas from Ogoja Senatorial District of Cross Rive State. In the shadow election supervised by Chief Anthony Enahoro from Uromi in the present Edo State, Wayas emerged winner. • Teniola, a retired Director in the Presidency, writes from Lagos.

The following day the General Secretary of the NPP, Chief Paul Unongo announced that his party has taken a decision to work in accord with NPN of President Shagari. Earlier, the NPP NWC had met at the house of Mr. Ademola Thomas in Victoria Island, Lagos.

There was also an election for the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives.
