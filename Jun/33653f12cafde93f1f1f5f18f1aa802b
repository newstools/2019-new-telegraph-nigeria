 Gizdodo, also known as gizzard and dodo (plantain), is a stir-fry of gizzards and fried plantain that is ever-popular at most Nigerian parties. For those that are not into chicken offal, you can certainly use any chicken part. I would suggest boneless chicken thighs they are a great alternative. Ingredients • 3 Giant sized ripe plantain • Chicken or Turkey Gizzard (500g) • 4 cups of sliced tomatoes • Half cup of sliced pepper (scotch bonnet) • 1 cup of sliced onions • One cup of sliced green pepper • Seasoning cubes • Salt to taste • Ground nut/vegetable oil How to make Gizdodo •Start by peeling off the back of the plantain and chopping to smaller bits with a kitchen knife. Slice the tomatoes, peppers and onions and set aside. •Wash the gizzards with hot water and precook for 20 minutes. Add seasoning cubes half teaspoon of salt and half cup of sliced onions. Check to see that the gizzard is soft and chop to smaller bits. •Fry the plantain with vegetable oil until it turn golden, scoop into a sieve and allow it to sit for a while. Reduce the oil and fry the chopped gizzard. •The gizzard would be somewhat dark-brown when it is properly fried. • Remove the fried gizzard and pour in the remaining half cup of onions, stir and add the tomatoes. Add the sliced pepper and fry for 10-15 minutes. Remember to stir occasionally so it doesn’t get burnt.  • Once the tomato is properly fried, you are almost done with making gizdodo. Add one cube of seasoning to it and salt to taste. • Transfer the fried gizzards, plantain and sliced green peppers. Stir all together, cover and allow simmering for 3 minutes and its ready! • Gizdodo can be served as a course meal or a side meal. Usually, it works best with jollof rice.
