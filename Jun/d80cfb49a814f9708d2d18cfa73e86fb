The Federal Government has expressed its commitment to pursuing the amendment of the Cybercrimes Act, which many lawyers, journalists and activists have considered repressive, unconstitutional and illegal. Head, Cybercrimes Prosecution Unit, Federal Ministry of Justice, Mr. Terlumun George Tyendezwa, made the disclosure while speaking at a media interactive session on the ‘Constitutionality and Legality of the Cybercrimes Act in Nigeria’, organized by the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) in collaboration with the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), USA. In his speech, Tyendezwa noted that government was willing to listen to every voice of wisdom regarding how best the Act can be amended to meet the yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians. “The Cybercrimes Act is not perfect. One of the reasons why I am here is that I have an open door; we want to engage on the Act. We are interested in engaging with all stakeholders in the justice sector. “Whatever is not useful, we can seek amendment on this. From the point of passage, we as the operators knew that there were things that need to change. We are presently collating memoranda on amendment of the Act. But amendment takes time and cost money. “We know the importance of law as a social driver. The office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice continues to place high value on entrenched fundamental human rights and engaging with all stakeholders on the Cybercrimes Act is one of our approaches”, he said.
