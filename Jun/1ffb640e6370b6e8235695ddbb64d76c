President Muhammadu Buhari has commended Nigerians residing in foreign countries for living peacefully with their host communities. The President stated this yesterday when he received a delegation of the Progressive Ambassadors of Nigeria (PAN) led by its National President, Comrade Jasper Emenike, who paid a courtesy visit to the State House. The President enjoined Nigerians in the Diaspora to “bear in mind the sensitivities of their host communities” and forge harmonious relationships. Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to the President, Femi Adesina, in a statement, said Buhari, while expressing delight at the visit by members of the Progressive Ambassadors of Nigeria, lauded their choice of name and “for flying high the green-white-green flag.” He also commended the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Nigeria Diaspora Commission for positively interfacing with the members of the Progressive Ambassadors of Nigeria in particular, and Nigerians living abroad in general. Earlier, Comrade Emenike, who described his organisation as “a Pan-Nigerian, non-governmental and non-profit” group, had congratulated President Buhari on his re-election and successful inauguration. He said his members were on a “thank you, solidarity visit” to “formally convey our heartfelt appreciation to Mr President and Chairman of the Authority of ECOWAS Heads of State and Government on your swift intervention leading to the reopening of over 400 Nigerian Traders’ Shops in Ghana last October by the host government, over some trade policy disputes arising from the enforcement of the Ghana Local Investment Promotion Act in clear violation of the letters and spirit of the ECOWAS Free Movement Protocols.”  According to Comrade Emenike, the President’s intervention was a “loud demonstration” of his sense of leadership, character and commitment to the principles of ECOWAS regional integration. He also applauded the anti-corruption campaign of the current administration, while pledging his organisation’s commitment towards grassroots mobilisation and support.
