 A member of the victorious Super Eagles team to the 2013 edition of the African Cup of Nations, Efe Ambrose, has said the current cast can shock the continent just the way his squad did in South Africa six years ago.
Nigeria were two-times winners going into the competition but the side managed by late Stephen Keshi were never considered for the title the cast was full of greenhorns.
However, they shattered the formbooks to clinch Nigeria’s third AFCON title.
Ambrose has said the current Eagles head for Egypt 2019 with only just three players with AFCON experience but they could go all the way if they believe in themselves.
“In 2013, no one gave us a chance because people felt we were inexperienced,” he said.
“I believe this squad has got the belief, zeal, passion and hunger and will be hoping to repeat our feat in South Africa.
“Also, these boys want to make a name for themselves and I am sure that the Super Eagles will not let Nigerians down in Egypt.”
