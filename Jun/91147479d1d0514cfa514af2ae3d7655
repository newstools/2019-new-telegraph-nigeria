Leader of the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), Chief Ralph Uwazurike, has demanded the immediate and unconditional release of his men, who had been in police detention for days.
Uwazurike said if the members were not immediately released, he would seek redress in court.
It was learnt that 26 members of MASSOB and Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) were arrested by a Joint Task Force in Anambra State.
These members were arrested on May 21 and 29 during the groups’ 19 years anniversary celebration of a New Biafra.
Uwazurike said that the arrest was an infringement on his members’ fundamental human rights. Against this backdrop, the leader and founder of MASSOB called on the police to release his non-violent Biafra agitators immediately or risk court action.
In a statement signed by Biafra Director of Information and his Media Assistant, Mazi Chris Mocha, Uwazurike accused the police of denying that only members of the outlawed IPOB were arrested in the course of pulling down Biafran flags hoisted on electric poles on Obodoukwu Road and other strategic junctions. Uwazurike stressed that such denials didn’t hold water.
According to the statement, the Joint Task Force, led by Mr. John Ohuagbaka, allegedly beat up residents, including workers in a noodle factory and also broke into vehicles parked on the factory’s premises.
The statement claimed that items left in one of the cars, included N648,000 cash and one dozen of IDEAL Biafra government books authored by Uwazuruike.
Uwazurike insisted that it was wrong of the JTF or their commander to force open a parked car in order to tow it to police area commander’s office in Onitsha.
