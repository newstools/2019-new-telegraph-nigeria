The suspended District Head of Kura, Bello Bayero, has urged his brother, the Emir of Bichi, Aminu Bayero, to hasten the resignation of his position to safeguard the Kano Emirate dynasty. Speaking in an audio clip, Bello, who had been recently suspended as District Head of Kura Local Government over his failure to pay homage to Rano Emir, urged the Bichi Emir to urgently resign from his position.  According to him, the message was an advice to his brother to resign as Emir of Bichi and return to Kano Emirate, where he had held the position of Wambai in order to safeguard the image and prestige of Dabo clan and continue to support Emir Sanusi, who inherited the throne from their father.  He also described the creation of the new emirates as calamity on the clan of Mallam Ibrahim Dabo and royal heritage, saying that; “It is where our father, late Ado Bayero spent 50 years on the  throne and ruled in peace and harmony. He taught us to love one another without discrimination.”  Apparently weeping in the audio, the embattled district head wondered why his brother accepted the offer of Bichi Emir, which was turned down out-rightly by his uncle, Abbas Sanusi and brother, Nasiru Bayero, the Galadima and Chiroma Kano respectively, despite their ambition of ascending the throne.  According to him, the appointment of his brother was a calculated attempt to destroy the Danfodio dynasty and entire Fulani clan, as well as exposing the heritage to ridicule for cheap political gains. He said his brother had stooped too low to accept the offer of what he described as a village emirate, which had never been found in history. “We are heirs of a city emirate, not village emirate, a prestigious and historic emirate. Instead of Wambai to exercise restraint to wait for his time to rule Kano Emirate and succeed his father’s throne.
