 Former Super Eagles coach, Austin Eguavoen, has charged the national team Manager, Gernot Rohr, to build his players’ confidence and give them the belief that they can win the Africa Cup of Nations which starts in Egypt on Friday.
According to Eguavoen, the body language of the coach is not good for the confidence of the team and there is need for him to work on that as he is of the opinion that the team can go all the way to winning the trophy.
He also called on the players not to be distracted with comments coming from Nigerians and advised them to concentrate on the championship.
“Good a thing the 2019 Africa Cup of Nation is kicking off few days from now for African stars to showcase their stuff,” he said.
“I am also very elated that Nigeria’s flag will be hoisted among African countries that will be in Egypt.
“But I am not too comfortable with comments coming from the Super Eagles camp. As a manager you should have total confidence in your team; when I read his statement saying that it would be difficult for Eagles to reach the semifinals, it is like a coach not having confidence in himself.
“As football managers, our duty is to build trust in our team and make them believe that they can do it. In a situation like this, an average Nigerian is concerned about the team, fans are very funny and difficult people to handle, it is more serious in Europe than in Africa.
“Football stakeholders want a team to do the impossible, no country wants his team to fail, so our boys must not allow distractions in any form.
“In Group B, no side is a push over; they are in Egypt for business, so it is going to be tough for all the teams in the group. But Super Eagles have an edge over two debutants Madagascar and Burundi, so they should be able to top the group, we are solidly behind them, Nigerians expect good results from them.”
