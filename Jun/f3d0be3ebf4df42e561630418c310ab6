 …spends N64.8bn on network expansion lTelco to list 500m shares on July 4  Nigeria’s third largest telecommunications operator by subscriber number, Airtel, raked in N400 billion as revenue from its voice and data services in 12 months, New Telegraph has learnt.
According to Airtel Africa’s financial statement for the year ended March 31, 2019, the company’s income was boosted by significant growth in its data subscriptions.
The Group’s full year financial result obtained by our correspondent revealed that the Nigeria unit recorded 25.2 per cent growth in revenue at $1.1 billion, which when converted to naira using the current exchange rate of N360 to one dollar, translated to N400 billion.
For the same period last year, the company had generated N320 billion ($889 million).
Among 14 operations in Africa, Airtel Nigeria accounted for 37 per cent of the Group’s total revenue for the year, which stood at $2.988 billion.
This underscores the huge potential in Nigeria’s telecoms market, a factor that has kept the operators afloat amidst challenges in the operating environment.
Analysis of the financial statement showed that the company’s voice revenue grew by 16.9 per cent to N267.8 billion ($744 million) as against N229.3 billion ($637 million) recorded in the previous year.
This, the company said, was driven by growth in minutes of calls made by subscribers, which rose by 29.1 per cent to 60.2 billion compared to 46.7 billion minutes of calls recorded in 2018.
The company’s data revenue grew by 56.1 per cent at N93.9 billion ($261 million) compared to N60.1 billion ($167 million) in the previous year.
According to the result, the growth was driven by increase in the number of data customers and growth in total number of megabytes (MB) used by the subscribers. MBs used on the network in the 2019 financial year grew by 57.8 per cent to N195.9 billion as against N124.2 billion recorded in the previous year.
According to the Group’s statement, Airtel Nigeria incurred capital expenditure of N64.8 billion ($180 million) during the year.
It noted that the money was spent primarily on network expansion and upgrades to enhance its services delivery.
Meanwhile, the telecommunications company said it is finalising plans to list at least 500 million shares on the Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE).
The initial offer will comprise of between 14 per cent and 18.9 per cent of the firm’s shares at a price of between N363 and N454.
According to the company’s prospectus, the shares will start trading on the Exchange on the 4th of July.
“It is expected that the Nigerian admission will become effective on July 4, 2019, and unconditional dealings in the ordinary shares will commence on the NSE on July 4, 2019,” the document read.
Airtel Africa revealed that the initial offer will be open to institutional investors and High Net worth Individuals only. The shares will be issued through a book building process.
The Executive Vice Chairman, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Danbatta, had recently described the listing of MTN shares as a precedent and expressed optimism that other mobile network operators would follow suit.
“We triggered the listing of MTN on the NSE and MTN has complied,” the EVC said. “I remember issuing warning to MTN to ensure that they comply with the provision of the settlement agreement before May 2019.”
Airtel Africa is also preparing to list on the London Stock Exchange where it will sell at least 25 per cent of its shares. The firm aims to collect $750 million from the London listing.
Its CEO, Raghunath Mandava, told investors: “We have built Airtel Africa into the second-largest mobile operator in Africa and our clear strategy and efficient business model make us well positioned to capture the growth opportunities across our markets, in voice, data and mobile money.”
