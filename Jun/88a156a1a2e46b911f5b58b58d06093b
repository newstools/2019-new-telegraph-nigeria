Barely two months after she confirmed the crash of her marriage to Nollywood actor, IK Ogbonna, on social media, Sonia, has sent a message to fans to stop begging them to come back together. The 27-year-old beauty queen made the appeal in a post on InstaStories while responding to a question from a fan asking when she and IK Ogbonna would mend their relationship. While urging fans not to “push people back together,” Sonia, who got married to Ogbonna at a courthouse in Zagreb, Croatia in 2015, wrote. According to her, it is better for ex-partners to wish each other happiness and peace of mind instead of being forced to deceive themselves and everyone else. While she has made it clear the marriage has broken down and she has moved on, her estranged former hubby, IK Ogbonna, insists they are only separated; not divorced and as such can still come back together.
