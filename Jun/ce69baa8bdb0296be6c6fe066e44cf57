Speaking further, Iwobi said the dream of the team is to win the championships and they are going to work hard to achieve that.
“Everyone is expecting us to go through in the group, but it is not going to be easy,” he said. “Every game is going to be almost like a war, a serious battle; every game is going to be competitive. I am sure Burundi, Madagascar and Guinea will want to show the stuff they are made of; we are going to find it difficult. “This is my first AFCON, we did well during the qualifiers, it wasn’t easy, but we did very well. We are going to the AFCON with a lot of confidence with our head held high. “People should not also forget that we have a very young team and the future is very bright and also the team is very young with a lot of young talents. We are looking forward to the AFCON. “We have the dream of going there to win the trophy and that’s what we are going to do, we are going to work hard and see how we can make ourselves and the country proud.”
