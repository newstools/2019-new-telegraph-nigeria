The first 100 primary health centres revitalized by the Osun State Government will be delivered for public use next month, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola has said. The government is revitalizing 332 primary health centres, one per ward, with the grants it received for its performance in the Save A Million Lives (SOML) programme of the World Bank promoted by the federal ministry of health. On Sunday during the inspection of some of the centres under construction around Osogbo, the state capital, Oyetola expressed satisfaction with the quality of work done in places he visited. He said: “We are here to inspect some of the ongoing Primary Healthcare Centres across the state and to assess the state of the work done and the quality of the job. “Some weeks ago, we flagged off the revitalisation and rehabilitation of 332 Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCs) out of which 100 of them are witnessing total turnaround already. “Our intention is to ensure that each of the 332 wards across the state has a PHC and I must appreciate the fact that the federal government has been so helpful on this initiative. “Health is wealth and no serious government will play with the health of its people because development revolves around it. “So, the intention is to ensure that our people have access to quality health facilities wherever they live. “I am satisfied with what I saw and I can assure that in the next two to three weeks, we must have delivered on the first phase of the project.”
