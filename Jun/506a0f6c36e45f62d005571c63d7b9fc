Yinka Odumakin is the National Publicity Secretary of pan Yoruba group, Afenifere  The governors had a summit in Ibadan, where they attempted to play down what confronts the South-West at the moment, but no one disclaim reports of the harrowing experience of the people of the region allegedly in the hands of herdsmen across the six states in the South-West as well as Kwara and Kogi states.
All the reports provide clear indications of failure of the state as the security forces are largely incapable or unwilling to safeguard the lives of our people against these criminals. We are not aware of any of them that has been arrested or is under trial at the moment as all the Federal Government has done so far is to make excuses for the Boko Haram and Miyetti Allah groups that have been accused of many crimes against Nigerians.
One of the governors that spoke for almost 32 minutes didn’t mention anything on insecurity in Yorubaland. And these are the governors, who were saying that Zamfara State is the worst hit and that insecurity is a general problem. Twenty-four hours after the summit, we are seeing this happening.
When they rose from their meeting, they issued their communiqué, but there was nothing special about the communiqué and nothing can come out of it. The essence of the summit was not to address the problem, but to just pretend that something is being done.
But clearly, at this point now, the Yoruba people should know now that their fate lies with them. Like Afenifere said a week ago, the Yoruba should activate their traditional self-defence system now because, like Theophilus Danjuma said to this country a few weeks back, the people depending on official protection to defend them in this situation now, they will all die one by one.
