Members of the Anambra State Election Petitions Tribunal may soon be reshuffled following alleged pressure from some petitioners on the office of the President of the Appeal Court. The Coordinator of Anambra South Integrity Forum (ASIF), Mr. Maximus Okafor Ibeadi, disclosed this while speaking with journalists shortly after the meeting of the group in Awka. He said: “We have confidence in the three tribunal panels in Anambra State and what they have done so far is impressive because they act in accordance with the point of law. “But some forces whose candidates did not win the senatorial election are making underground moves for the panellists to be changed with new members who would dance to their tune. “There are some forces who have been benefiting from the locust of the past eight years that have lost their deposits at the end of this election and they are remotely contacting their co-travellers to impress on the revered president of the Appeal Court to change the judges. “We know that His Lordship, the President of the Appeal Court is not somebody that can be pushed around and he believes in the rule of law and sacrosanctity of the judicial process and urge him not to allow those desperate politicians to have their way. “These two petitioners I know were compelled by their supporters to challenge the outcome of the election in court and going by the people I know very well they are not given to overheating the polity by trying to change the goal post in the middle of a football match.” “We use this medium to urge the petitioners not to give in to the machinations of their desperate supporters who would not allow an all-inclusive representation to come in place but to benefit individually from the collective interest of the people of Anambra South Senatorial District.”
