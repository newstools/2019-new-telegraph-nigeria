Ex-international, Ike Shorunmu, has said the hard work has now started for the Super Eagles after their Group B victory against Burundi at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Alexandria, Egypt on Saturday.
Speaking with our correspondent, the former number one of the national team said the performance of Burundi showed that there were no minnows in football anymore.
“Burundi came all out against us because they had nothing to lose,” the former Super Eagles goalkeeper said.
“It took a lot of experience from our players to get the victory and the team should expect more of that in subsequent matches.
“Guinea drew with Madagascar in their opening game and they will want a win against Nigeria in the next game, so we have to be careful.
“A win is important in the next game so as to build the team’s confidence because all the hard work against Burundi will be nothing if we don’t get a win against Guinea.
“The most important thing is the maximum points which we got against Burundi and we must do that in the next game.”
Meanwhile, the former goalkeeper trainer of the Super Eagles has said the clean sheet recorded by the team against Burundi will boost the confidence of goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi who was in goal for the team.
According to Shorunmu, Akpeyi has shown that he has what it takes to be the team’s number one and keeping a clean sheet in the Super Eagles opening match will build his confidence.
