By Andrew Iro Okungbowa The organisers and authorities in Israel have debunked the pockets of protestations making the rounds in Israel, saying that all is set for the two days event to begin today. They described the protests as a stage managed mild protestations and as of no effect as Israel is engulfed by excitement and in expectation mood for the much anticipated open air meeting by Prophet T. B  Joshua, Nigeria’s most followed prohpet across the world. The two days meeting is set for Mount Precipice, with nationals from 23 countries already arrived for the programme, with more people being expected. In Nazareth, the host city,  most of the hotels, especially in the Old Nazareth, are fully booked and tour operators are kept busy ferrying pilgrims for the programme from the Ben Gurion International Airport to Nazareth. Among the countries already in town are Holland, Jamaica, Cuba, Russia, Nigeria, Singapore, Japan, Spain, South Africa, the United Kingdom, Germany, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Canada, Botswana, Mexico, Argentina, Finland, Iceland, South Korea, Cameroun, Ghana and Italy. Organizers say nationals from more than 50 countries are expected at the event. Speaking on the event, one of the  tour operators ferrying pilgrims for the programme, Mrs Deborah Luca, an Israeli national, described the turnout so far as overwhelming. She said: “I did not know that there will be so many people coming. It is tremendous; it is beyond my expectation. I am a minister of worship, I bring people annually here in the past three years, we have our annual Art of Worship, what we are seeing here is better seen than described .” Speaking on the Prophet TB Joshua meeting, a tour bus driver from Nazareth  described the number of visitors as extremely impressive. His words: “The peak period for tourism in Nazareth is between July and August when the children are on vacation. What we are seeing is absolutely impressive for just one event.”
