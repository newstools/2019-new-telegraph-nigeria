Former Bendel Insurance player Johnbull Edosomwan has described Paul Aigbogun- led Flying Eagles team ouster from the ongoing FIFA U- 20 World Cup in Poland as the worst side ever in the history of Nigerian football.  Edosamwan, who is the President of Edo All Stars advised Nigerian footballers wishing to do well in football to always declare their real age. “Since Nigeria started to attend FIFA tournaments we never had it so bad. The present U- 20 Flying Eagles is the worst team we have had ever.  I don’t want to use any harsh words on them but they have performed below expectation. There was no formation, no pattern, no cohesion and no understanding among the players. The players had problems of age, some of them were above 20 years, Nigerian coaches are not helping these boys, if you put a player in your team because of what you will gain and you know that such a player is over aged you are invariably killing football. “Our football managers must get it right; Nigerian cadet teams are always big threat on the world stage.  To get it right, we must go back to the basis.”
