Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State yesterday announced the cancellation of the proposed foreign trip by local government chairmen to attend a workshop. The governor, who made this known in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary (CPS), Mr. Adeniyi Adesina, said although it was desirable to continue to expose government officials to capacity building, the time was not auspicious for this trip which was approved in September 2018. The governor therefore assured pubic officers in the state that they would continue to be given the benefit of training at the appropriate time, according to the financial situation of the state.
