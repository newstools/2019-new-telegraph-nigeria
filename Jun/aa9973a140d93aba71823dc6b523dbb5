  NaijaSuperFans.com, an online community for Nigerian sports fans at home and all across the world, was officially launched on Saturday in Lagos. In his welcome address, NaijaSuperFans president, Mumuni Alao, hinted that the forum was inspired by readers of Complete Sports, Complete Football, Sports Souvenir and the several other publications from the stables of Complete Communications Limited, Nigeria’s pioneer providers of written sports content. “Long after some of the these titles were rested, members of our readership community continue to demand for them,” Alao, who is also the Group Managing Director of CCL, said. “The platform will be beneficial to all its members and this is why, as just a start, one lucky fan will win an all-expense paid trip to the 2019 AFCON in Egypt by participating in the quiz section where other fantastic prizes will be won weekly.” Four Nigerian sports stars Victor Ikpeba, Enefiok Udo-Obong, Peter Rufai and Anne Chiejine were named as the first batch of ambassadors of the forum. There are six main categories on the menu bar of the forum with a large number of sub-categories which include top conversation, history, videos, quiz and win, super fans story, Complete Sports archive, politics, business and entertainment.
