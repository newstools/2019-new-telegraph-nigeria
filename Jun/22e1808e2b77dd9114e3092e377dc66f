The Ogun State House of Assembly yesterday voided all appointments, employments and financial agreements carried out by the administration of the immediate past governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, between February 1 and May 28, 2019. It also suspended traditional rulers, including 75 Coronet Obas who were recently appointed and upgraded from Baale, within the same period. The House further suspended all local governments and Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) political functionaries to allow investigation into allegations of gross misconduct and misappropriation of public funds levelled against them. The decisions were reached during plenary at the Assembly Complex, Oke- Mosan, Abeokuta, which was presided over by the Speaker, Suraj Adekunbi. Another highpoint of the sitting was the replacement of Hon. Yinka Mafe, who defected from Allied People’s Movement (APM) to All Progressives Congress (APC) after general election, with Hon. Olusola Odofin as Majority Leader of the House. At the plenary, the House passed a bill and three resolutions nullifying all the “last-minute” appointments, employments and financial agreements done by Amosun. The passage of the bill titled H. B 047/OG/2019 “Nullification of Irregularities (Amendment) Law, 2019” followed the suspension of the Assembly’s standing orders 45-48 to allow for the consecutive second and third readings of the bill. Consequently, after the first reading of the bill on the floor of the Assembly by the Deputy Clerk, Deji Adeyemo, and extensive debate by lawmakers during second reading, motion for the third reading was moved by the new Majority Leader, Olusola Sonuga.
