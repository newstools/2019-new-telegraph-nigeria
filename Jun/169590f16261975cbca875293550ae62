Estranged wife of former Governor Sullivan Chime of Enugu State, Clara, yesterday told an FCT High Court Apo, that she left her matrimonial home over fear for her life.
Clara made the allegation while being cross-examined by counsel to the former governor, Paul Onyia, in the petition filed by Chime for the dissolution of their 11-year-old marriage.
Clara, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), informed the court that she met her husband while he was Enugu State governor.
She said: “I bought two vehicles; a Lexus 570 SUV and a BMW S6 for myself while married to the former governor. I did not use his money to buy those vehicles from the allowances I received as the wife of the governor.”
The former governor’s wife also informed the court that she bought her landed property from the Enugu State Housing Corporation, adding that she paid for it after leaving office.
She said: “I have the title documents of the landed property.”
Asked if she was aware that the petitioner ceased to be governor since 2015, Clara said, “I am aware that he ceased to be Enugu State governor on May 29, 2015.”
She, however, disclosed that she did not know how much the former governor earned as pension, saying, “I have no idea of how much he is being paid as pension.”
The former governor’s wife also informed the court that she was involved in oil and gas business, adding that she had been living well despite not receiving maintenance allowance from her husband since 2013 they had been living apart.
She also alleged that her estranged husband had refused to allow her see her only child. “I only see my child during church service or social events whenever I am in town,” she added.
After listening to her testimony, Justice Angela Otaluka adjourned the case till October 14 for adoption of final written addresses.
