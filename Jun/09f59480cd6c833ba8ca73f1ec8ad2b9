Behind a successful man, there is a woman, aptly fits the situation between, boss of Federal Inland Revenue, Babatunde Fowler and his beautiful wife, Rosemary as the successes she has helped her husband to record since they got married about two decades ago is evident. Meanwhile, despite having all it takes in the wealth and riches at her disposal to compete on the social space, Rosemary would rather opt for a quiet life style that has made little or nothing known about her. When Rosemary turned 60 recently, socialites’ milieu rose to honour the new diamond lady. On her birthday, there were no echoes of a big party to celebrate the remarkable coming of age of the gorgeous lady until much later. She, however, took turning 60 in her stride and relished the new decade. Apple of Babatunde’s eye, Rosemary, who makes her age look so beautiful, was grateful to God for the opportunity to attain the landmark age. She took to her social media platform to express her heart felt gratitude to her creator for making her see such a landmark birthday anniversary even as she went on to pour more wonderful thoughts.
