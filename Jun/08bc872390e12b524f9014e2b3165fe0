Police in Niger State have arrested a 35-year-old man, Umar Bahago, for alleged cattle rustling and recovered 30 cows from him. The police said Bahago had been making life unbearable for cattle owners in Luma village, Fulani Camp in New-Bussa, Borgu Local Government Area. Bahago of Kubule-Babana in Borgu Local Government Area was trailed and arrested by police detectives attached to New-Bussa Division on a tip-off. Bahago, a father of five, was alleged to have rustled 30 cows belonging to Buba Adamu of the same address. The father of Adamu had earlier reported the missing cows to the police. It was learnt that Bahago had been into the act for over three years until his arrest. It was also learnt that Bahago and his accomplice, Muhammad Tukur, who is now at large, had intention of selling the cows at give-away prices to enable them settle their debts.
Bahago told police investigators that it was greed that pushed him into the crime. He said: “I’m a cattle rearer and I have nothing to show for it. I can’t even give account of what I did with the proceeds from the cattle I have rustled. I have no right to take what does not belong to me; I regret my action. My wife does not know that I am into cattle rustling. It was after my arrest she got to know. I know that she will divorce me.” The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Muhammad Abubakar, said the suspects had confessed to the crime.
Abubakar said that detectives recovered 30 cows and had handed them over to the rightful owner. He added that the suspect would be charged to court soon after investigations.
