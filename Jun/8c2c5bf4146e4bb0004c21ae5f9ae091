  After moving listlessly in ythe house, Alice moves into her room and stretches out on the bed. Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof! Heaven knows she tried being a good wife. She tried all within her powers to make a good home but it’s obvious one can’t win always. She’s grateful to James for giving her his name, making her a respectable woman by society standards. But is that what marriage is all about? Why is she still the one struggling to ensure they live a good life while her husband goes chasing after skirts? Is it that she doesn’t satisfy his sexual needs or that he’s just insatiable? What sexual satisfaction can’t she give a man? James attests to her ability to daze a man in that quarter. So, what exactly is his problem? She has never complained about his failure to take care of the home, yet, he won’t let her be. Her mind roves to Dave.  Dave! He is just like her guardian angel, appearing at the point she’s at her lowest emotionally. He has always been a pillar of support to her. Always encouraging her to hold on. The first day James took her to Dave’s house, she had felt a fluttering in her heart. After years of separation, she still feels something for him. Dave feels the same way about her. He said so. They tried reining back their feelings. For a long time, they succeeded but like they say, the flesh is weak. The first time they got together sexually was a day after she found out that James had sired children with another woman. That was about a year ago. Her heart was broken. She needed to talk to someone. She had called Dave and her tone alarmed him. She wanted to talk and they agreed to <img class="size-medium wp-image-215606 alignleft" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/I%E2%80%99m-going-hubby-shopping-300x167.png?resize=300%2C167&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="167" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/I’m-going-hubby-shopping.png?resize=300%2C167&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/I’m-going-hubby-shopping.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1">meet in his house. She cried so much while narrating her story and in the bid to comfort her, they lost it and there and then in his private sitting room upstairs, they shed their clothes and reached heights that they didn’t believe they could reach. It wasn’t once, it wasn’t twice that day, they reached into their souls and slept afterwards, spent. They avoided each other for a long time after that. But because they do business together, it was difficult to keep off each other’s way for too long. The last time was just before Dave got married. James’ car was at the mechanic’s and he needed to see some people, he said. Alice had an early evening business meeting. They went out in Alice’s car. James drove her there and promised to pick her later in the evening. James called later to say he would be a bit late. The office closed and Alice moved to a shop beside it. She window-shopped till the shop closed around 8pm. When she became impatient, James told her to go wait for him in Dave’s house since she was close by. Dave was home. She called James again and he told her to give him some hours and dropped the phone without ending the call. Alice didn’t cut the call either and so heard his quarrel with his mistress over money. She put the phone on speaker and Dave also listened in. James didn’t come to pick her till around 1am. In the meantime, Dave comforted her the best way he could. They explored their bodies and relived old time. They threw caution to the wind. Alice let herself go in his arms and didn’t release him until his peen wept like a broken pipe, convulsing and throwing up like a wimp before going limp. For once, they didn’t feel so bad. They made it look like punishment for James who felt he was very smart. Of course, James didn’t suspect anything when he came to pick his wife home…he was as drunk as a skunk. Alice rues that unguarded moment about four months ago. It is the cause of her joy today. She needs to take a decision fast! What will she do with James? She rubs her tummy dreamily as she drifts off to sleep. *****  James is trying to patch his life. Suddenly, he has realised that for seven years, he had lived off a woman! Whatever pushed him into such an embarrassing lifestyle! Whatever made him to think he could enjoy the life of dependency? He remembers his mother’s favourite saying, ‘Dirty hand leads to oily mouth’. Whatever made him forget that! His late mother was a hardworking businesswoman who toiled day and night to ensure that her children had the best of life. Even when she lost her husband at his prime, she made sure that the quality of life their children was used to didn’t drop noticeably. She taught her children the import of hard work. She would have died of shock if she were alive to see what became of her beloved son today. “Mother, I’m sorry. I promise to change from my bad ways today,” James mutters. He smiles as he negotiates the last turn to Dave’s house. He has spoken to Dave on the phone and they agree to meet in his house. He has tried to avoid Kathryn for so long but today, he has to see Dave because it has become a matter of life and death. There are business opportunities, Dave had told him. They had discussed about them and how James could come in. He wonders what he would have done without Dave. His heart misses a beat when he remembers Kathryn. Fate!
He honks at the gate and the security man throws the massive gate open and he drives in. **** Kathryn feels like she’s sitting on a keg of gun powder. She wonders how Dave will feel if he finds out his beloved cousin has slept with his wife. She shudders. She will do anything to keep Dave, if it means dying with that secret. But is it possible? James looks like trouble. His being married to her soul sister, Alice, notwithstanding. She is sure Alice will help her if need be, but wait, Alice has been behaving funny the past few days.  She has blamed it on hormonal changes cause by pregnancy but it seems more than that. Alice is like an open book if you know her very well and Kathryn does. She has asked her repeatedly what the problem is but she has been evasive. The other day, she has cried her eyes out on the phone when they spoke but would not say why.  Kathryn has felt that it has to do with James not doing anything for a living and has discussed the issue with Dave. Dave is also sort of disturbed but she just cannot pinpoint what his anxiety is all about. However, something rings in her mind: Alice continually said that she had hurt somebody that means the world to her as she cried that day. Well, she will get to the bottom of that when they see eyeball to eyeball later in the week, but now, she has to confront that monster that wants to wreck her life. Dave has called to say that James is coming over. She would have preferred that Dave is home before his arrival, but he is held up somewhere and will come home a clear hour later! Well, she will give it to James! She can’t allow any man to make her miserable in her husband’s house. She refuses to live like her soul sister! The bell chimes and she goes to let James in. “My wife, how are you doing?” James says in the most friendly tone and Kathryn is taken aback. This is the first time they will be alone since they met after she quit her trade. “I’m fine,” she replies in an uncertain tone. James has always been antagonistic towards her; why being this civil? “I have a meeting with my brother. Please tell him I’m around. Hope you have something in the kitchen? I can eat a whole house right now,” he says. He actually looks tired. “My husband is not back. He’s held up in Tayo’s office. He said you should give him an hour. Lemme get something for you to eat,” Kathryn says. “Thanks,” James says after her as she walks to the kitchen. She isn’t sure of James friendliness. What has happened? Has Alice chided him over his irritable behavior to her? She dishes some food into a plate and serves him. She watches him eat heartily while she pretends to be watching the television. She clears the table when he is done and goes back to her favourite spot in the sitting room -the ottoman facing the big screen. “How are you doing dear,” James asks suddenly and her heart lurches.  “I’m good,” she replies. That husky voice! It throws her back to those days they were together. He has not used that voice since they met again. He has always almost growled whenever he talks to her, so she is thrown off guard at his tone now. “How’s life with you? Anyway, I can see you’re doing great,” he says again in that friendly tone. Kathryn watches him closely. She just doesn’t feel comfortable. James may just shatter her life today when Dave comes in. He may just reveal their past together. She wishes that Alice is around. She has always felt safe with her. Unfortunately, Alice is not here. She realises that she has to be nice to him so that he doesn’t bring her world tumbling down. Be nice to a man who obviously hates her! She curses under her breath and smiles.  He catches the smile and smiles back.  His next words throw her off her feet…  *******  Now, this is the definition of crisis! Join me here on Sunday as we continue on thus interesting journey. ********************************* •Send your observations to: julietbumah@gmail.com
