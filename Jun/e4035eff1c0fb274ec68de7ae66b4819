Contrary to reports in some section of the media, no bench warrant was issued by the election petition tribunal at the last adjourned date. According to a Niger state APC group, the tribunal agreed with the submissions of learned SANs for the 1st and 2nd respondents that the service of the subpoenas on Col Sani Bello, DG NYSC, Registrar NECO was a nullity as they were not personally served and as such none of them could have committed contempt. The court therefore set aside the subpoenas and ordered that subpoenas be served on them afresh within 72 hours. The tribunal however held that it was only the Education Secretary of Mokwa that was personally and properly served but issued no bench warrant for his arrest instead the tribunal, agreeing with submissions of the learned SANs for the 1st and 2nd Respondents, ordered that the petitioners to tender secondary evidence in their possession, if any. The matter was then adjourned to Thursday, 27th June 2019 for the petitioners to close their case.
