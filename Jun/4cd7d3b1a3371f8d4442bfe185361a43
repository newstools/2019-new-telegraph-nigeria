The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has faulted a newspaper report (not New Telegraph) alleging that the apex bank’s claims on the Federal Government had risen to “N8.12trillion in four years.”
In a statement yesterday, the regulator said the report entitled: “CBN’s life support to FG rises 780 per cent to N8.12 trillion in four years,” was, “not only false, but an attempt, through sheer mischief, to distort and misrepresent CBN’s financial operations and also to misinform the investing public on the financial health of our country.”
It further stated: “In order to arrive at their plot, the authors of the story had conveniently restricted their report only to CBN’s claims on the Federal Government while ignoring other numerous deposits of the Federal Government, including those of the Treasury Single Account (TSA), with CBN.”
The banking watchdog explained that: “As can be clearly deduced by any unbiased and informed analyst, when the claims of the Federal Government on CBN are netted against the claims of CBN on the Federal Government, the resulting net positions indicate that the FG was actually the net creditor to CBN in 2014, 2015 and 2017 to the tune of N2.14 trillion, N1.65 trillion and N0.36 trillion, respectively. On the other hand, CBN was the net creditor to the Federal Government in 2016 and 2018 to the tune of N0.11 trillion and N0.34 trillion, respectively.”
“From the foregoing and the detailed database, it is clearly inappropriate to compare the position as at end-2018 with the position as at end-2014, ignoring the movements within the period. We wish therefore to reassure the investing community and the general public that CBN remains faithful to its statutory mandate as banker and financial adviser to the Federal Government,” it stated.
