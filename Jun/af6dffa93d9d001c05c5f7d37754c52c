Presidential Task Team on the clearing of Apapa gridlock said it had restored sanity on bridges and roads in the area.  The Executive Vice Chairman of the team, Kayode Opeifa, disclosed this while briefing journalists on the state of enforcement on removal of trucks on the road. He said thousands of heavy duty and containerised trucks had been removed on Lagos bridges and roads.  The vice chairman said the team had succeeded in all its six-pronged terms of reference, which were captured under the framework of restoration of law and order in Apapa.  Opeifa, who led a team of 14 other stakeholders comprising the Nigeria Port Authority (NPA), Nigeria Shippers Council, transport union leaders, Lagos State Transport Management Authority (LASTMA), Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing (FMPWH), the police, Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Lagos State government, freight forwarders, licensed customs agents and the media, in the task of decongesting traffic, said the two critical access roads into Apapa ports and all adjoining roads and bridges which had been clogged by intractable traffic had now been cleared and free of gridlock.  The vice chairman, who spoke after a tour of the axis, listed some of the terms to include the clearing of the gridlock on all access roads and the port areas, ensuring a robust parking arena for all trucks pending their call up into the ports and the restoration of law and order in the area among others.  He said: “We are proud to report that the traffic situation around the two main entry points into Apapa has generally improved, with the situation around the Western Avenue, Ijora, Eko Bridge, Marine Bridge and Ajegunle axis generally under control, while the traffic challenges being experienced at the second entry point especially around Berger underpass (Berger Suya), Coconut and Tin Can first and second gates on the Apapa- Oshodi Expressway, due primarily to failed portion of the road, is being brought under control.”  According to him, the team has in the last 14 days come up with a comprehensive solution to the traffic congestion in Apapa, and is at the threshold of developing a policy which, if sustained, will permanently address the issues of traffic congestion in the ports.
