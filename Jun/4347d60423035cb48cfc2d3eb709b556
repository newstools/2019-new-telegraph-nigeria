Amnesty International Nigeria has again accused the Federal Government of Nigeria of not doing enough to checkmate human rights abuses, including torture of citizens by the Police and other security agencies. In its latest report released yesterday, the global human rights organisation, said that despite recent government measures aimed at reducing the incidence of abuses, it had continued to receive reports of torture and other ill-treatment of persons in the custody of the military and police.
The report, which was released to mark the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, said that Nigerian authorities must do more to end the ongoing use of torture and other forms of ill-treatment by law enforcement agencies. Director, Amnesty International Nigeria, Osai Ojigho, who unveiled the report, said that Nigerians were still being denied justice, as the Nigerian judicial system has failed to prevent or punish torture, perpetuating a culture of impunity on the country. “Although steps have been taken to address torture in Nigeria, including the enactment of the Anti-Torture Act in December 2017 and the setting up of the presidential panel on reform of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) the use of torture by the police and others is still widespread. “Our research also shows that despite an existing law against the use of torture, no police officer has been charged under the act. Moreover, the Nigerian police is yet to amend Force Order 237 which allows police officers to shoot at fleeing suspects, giving room for lethal use of force that sometimes leads to extrajudicial killings,” Ojigho said.
