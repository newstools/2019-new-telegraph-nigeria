Shanghai Shenhua and Super Eagles striker, Odion Ighalo, has resumed full training with the rest of the Nigerian squad as the team continues preparations in Ismailia for the Africa Cup of Nations, our source revealed.
The former Watford FC forward has been out after sustaining a minor injury in Shenhua’s 1-1 draw against Tianjin Teda in a Chinese Super League encounter and missed the Super Eagles warm-up friendly against Zimbabwe last weekend in Asaba.
Ighalo had some training sessions with the team in Asaba but was not dressed for the warm-up clash against the Warriors which clearly indicated the coach was still allowing proper recovery. Ighalo had said he would not rush the recovery process in order to forestall a relapse.
The 29-year-old however completed full morning training routines with the whole squad for the first time in the camp at Ismailia after working with his personal physiotherapist and also undergoing some rehabilitation exercises towards recovery.
Ighalo’s return will come as a boost to the team as Eagles vie for honours at the Nations Cup in Egypt.
Meanwhile Eagles Manager, Gernot Rohr, is set to begin his tactical preparations with the squad as they step up preparations for the AFCON ties
After a goalless draw in the warm-up against Zimbabwe last weekend, Rohr will be looking to focus on improving the squad’s tactical understanding of the game.
It was learnt that the former Nantes boss will begin these training routines in Friday’s morning training sessions.
Nigeria will face Senegal in their final friendly match in Ismailia before kicking off their AFCON campaign against Burundi on June 22.
