Vanessa Okwara The blazer with the t-shirt is a controversial outfit in the fashion world. The blazer with a T-shirt look is often debated if it is acceptable or not but when worn correctly, it can look both classic and effortlessly stylish. Blazers are a great way to dress up an outfit for those times that a guy just wants to wear his comfortable jeans.  Add a slim-fit blazer to that T-shirt, and your look instantly goes from casual to a show stopper. A plain white t-shirt is the most versatile option, but colour t-shirts can have a vibrant effect. Graphic t-shirts create a super-casual look and give you the opportunity to express more of your personality. This looks great when paired with the right jeans and a blazer. Graphic tee shirts, especially band tee shirts or shirts with a well-designed image, are popular with guys and are a great way for a guy to show off his personality and preferences.  A guy wearing blazer over a graphic tee shirt will look stylish without any extra effort. Paired with canvas, sneakers or even flip flops, this type of outfit is perfect for looking good without much work. White sneakers look clean-cut and leave a nice impression, but colourful sneakers may help achieve a more casual look.
