The Chief Whip of the Osun of Assembly has called on residents of all communities in the state to support government and security operatives in ridding the state of various forms of criminality. Mr Olatunji was engaged by journalists shortly after he visited Governor Gboyega Oyetola at the Awolowo House, Asokoro, Abuja. The legislator assured that the Assembly would give accelerated passage to any legislation concerning security of lives and property. “Although we have sufficient legislation that deals with security in the state of Osun, but the Assembly will expeditiously respond to any other materials that can further enable government to provide secured and enabling environment for the peace loving and good people of the state”. Mr Olatunji commended Governor Oyetola for being proactive in addressing the challenge of the new paradigm of security threat in the state. The Osun Assembly Chief Whip argued that it was always very difficult, if not impossible for planed criminality to pervade a particular community without sabotage of some unscrupulous elements, including complacent silence of some citizens. The Legislator who represents Ife North State Constituency also condemned people fuelling apprehension and blowing the situation out of proportion by spreading falsehood. He appealed to traditional rulers, community leaders and all citizens to unite in the fight against crime and provide useful information when and where necessary.
