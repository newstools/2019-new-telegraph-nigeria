 After their impressive victory against Korea Republic in their second game of the on-going FIFA Women World Cup in France, the Super Falcons of Nigeria arrived Rennes on Thursday morning, the venue of their final group game against host France as they set their sight on qualifying for the next stage of the competition.
Super Falcons defeated Korea 2-0 in their last game which revived their chances at the World Cup after their opening game against Norway ended in a 3-0 defeat.
Players and officials are upbeat at their Best Western Plus Hotel Isidore in Rennes. The team had light training session an hour after arrival, with the 11 players who started against Korea Republic using the gymnasium while the others went running in the hotel premises.
The Super Falcons have a few days to rest and train hard for Monday’s clash with host nation France at the 28,000–capacity Roazhon Park in Rennes.
Rennes, located 55 kilometres south of the English Channel, is the largest city in the Brittany region, and with a population of over 200,000 people, is the 11th most populous city in France.
A draw in Monday’s encounter will most certainly see the African champions qualify for the Round of 16 at the 8th FIFA Women’s World Cup finals.
