The Police on Thursday docked two men at an Ikeja Magistratesâ€™ Court over alleged fraud and possession of fake currency notes in the sum of N400,000. The defendants, Ebuka Eze, 31, and Emmanuel Obi, 23, reside in Ajah, Lagos. They are facing a three-count charge of conspiracy, possession of fake currency and fraud. The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Prosecutor, ASP. Benson Emuerhi, said that the defendants committed the offences on May 2, at about 5.30 p.m., at Oluwanishola House, Ajah. Emuerhi said that the defendants were caught with fake naira notes. He said that the defendants, under false pretence, also obtained a Samsung S7, one Apple laptop, and three iPhones valued at N1.1 million from the complainant, one Mr Onamade Olajide. The prosecutor said that the offences contravened Sections 314, (1), (a), 372, and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Olufunke Sule-Amzat, granted the defendants bail in the sum of N200, 000 each, with two sureties each in like sum. Sule-Amzat said that the sureties must be blood relations of the defendants. She said that they must be gainfully employed and should show evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The chief magistrate adjourned the case until Oct. 28 for mention. (NAN)
