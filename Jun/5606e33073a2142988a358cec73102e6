Police in Lagos have arrested a domestic servant, Joseph Ogbu (22), who allegedly killed his mistress and her mother less than 24 hours after he was employed.
Ogbu allegedly killed his employer, Oreoluewa John (38), and her mother, Adejoke John (89), at their residence in Sururlere area of Lagos.
The incident, which occurred at No. 4, Ogunlana Drive in Sururlere, was said to have plunged members of the community into shock.
The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Bala Elkana, explained that about 3a.m. yesterday, the Surulere Police Station received a distress call, that Ogbu, from Oju Local Government Area of Benue State, employed as a domestic help on June 18, 2019, murdered his employer Oreoluwa and her 89-year-old mother in their apartment.
According to Elkana, during interrogation, Ogbu confessed that his employer asked him to clean the house at about 9pm of June 19, 2019, but an argument ensued between them, leading to his stabbing her with a knife.
Ogbu said that he was shocked when the mother of his employer slumped and died when she noticed that her daughter was dead.
Elkana said: “Considering the fact that they were both dead, the suspect moved some valuables such as electronics, handsets and household items into his employer’s Toyota Camry car. He attempted to flee from the house, to where he couldn’t be found, but he was arrested by policemen on patrol at Ogunlana pin down point. The stolen items, including the vehicle, were recovered. The crime scene was sealed off and the corpses of the two victims moved to Mainland Hospital, Yaba, for autopsy.”
