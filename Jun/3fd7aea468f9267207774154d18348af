…announces plans for world tour   Barely a week after releasing his new EP, Tradition one week ahead of schedule, Runtown has described music as his life rather than his occupation
In an interview with Pulse about the 6-track EP, the singer refuted claims that he stopped producing songs, saying: “Creating again? I actually never stopped creating. Music is not a job for me. It’s my life. It’s like saying; how does it feel to be breathing again? I never stopped breathing.”
According to him, the EP, mainly consisting of ‘vibes’, represent the space he currently finds himself on musical terms.
“The truth is that we don’t really overthink the music. At least not me. The whole idea of ‘vibe’ is all about energy. The vibe that this EP carries represents the energy I was on during the recording period. I have really been pursuing love and peace of mind. No matter what drama arises, I am focusing on love and positivity.
“The tone of love is tender. It is chill. I guess that’s what reflected on the EP. Who knows what space I’ll be in tomorrow? I focus on how I truly feel or how I want to feel and it naturally shines through my sound,” he said.
While noting reception by fans is the very reason for creating any work of art, Runtown, who had a controversial falling out with his former record label, Eric Manny Records, announced 2019 plans to include touring.
“The reception for the Tradition EP has been overwhelming. I think touring would be next for me. I want to see the look on people’s faces when they sing the songs on the EP.
“I also want people to experience the music on a different level. So, the next phase is definitely to embark on a worldwide tour, God willing,” he added, saying he plans to drop videos for “Emotions” on May 31, 2019 and with those for “International Bad Man Killa” and “Redemption” to follow soon.
