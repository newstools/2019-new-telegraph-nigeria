The Coalition of Civil Society Groups against terrorism in Nigeria has warned against giving undue publicity, to the recent reported cases of attacks, by the Boko Haram insurgents, in some parts of Borno State. This is just as the group insisted, that the Federal government has successfully defeated the once dreaded Boko Haram terrorist group but now confronted with a new phase of insurgency,  as symbolised by the incursion of the Islamic State’s West Africa Province ISWAP, into the country. The group also expressed its worry over the role of some politicians and media organisations, in the manner in which the recent cases of isolated and cowardly organised attacks by ISWAP, have been reported. The group in a statement signed by Comrade Odeyemi Oladimeji and Barr John Atani said, “by mis-reporting the recent attacks, which intelligence reports have confirmed are coordinated by the internationally known ISWAP, as Boko Haram attacks, is injurious to the morale of the Nigerian Armed Forces and its leadership. We wish to sincerely advise Nigerians against these antics that are deliberately targeted at denigrating the Nigerian military, particularly the Nigerian Army and it’s leadership in this false representation of  “ attack on military formations and some isolated attacks on soft targets, as being perpetrated by the Boko Haram terrorist group.” The coalition said it wish to remind Nigerians, that before the advent of the Buhari’s administration and the coming on board, of the incumbent Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Buratai, Nigerians witnessed what was near daily major onslaught by the Boko Haram insurgents, which practically made a very large part of the region deserted, with people having no trust in the capacity of the Army to protect  lives and property against the insurgents. But, today, confidence has been rebuilt, the people, in droves, have returned to their towns and villages. The group also said Nigerians should be aware that, all over the world, insurgency have never been completely defeated without the society. Out of desperation to survive by these terrorists,  hence, the resort to isolated attacks and desperate actions like we are currently seeing in Borno State. The group urged citizens to work with  security agencies to identify the remnants of the Boko Haram terrorist group and their international collaborators who have now infiltrated the country, as it says it is by so doing, that there will be no hiding place for the leftovers of Boko Haram and the invading ISWAP, until their activities finally go into extinction.                The group equally condemn,  the Sunday suicide bombing in Konduga, Local Government Area of Borno State which claims  some lives, we commiserate families of victims of this dastardly bomb blast. We pray for the repose of their souls and comfort for their families.
