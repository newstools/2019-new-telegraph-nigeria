Former Coordinator of Ukaba Development Centre, Onicha local government area of Ebonyi State, John Elom yesterday raised the alarm over an alleged threat to his life.
Elom, a native of Ukawu community, Onicha local government who addressed journalists in Abakaliki said a group of persons who he described as self-styled power brokers from neighbouring Oshiri in the local government were after his life.
He alleged that thugs loyal to the said power brokers had been after him and that they fatally attacked his brother, Chief Chidi John Elom and two of his supporters; Ubanna Epoto and James Odah.
Elom said: “I wish to condemn unequivocally the grand efforts by this group of power peddlers to run my community like a colony and victimize all who challenge their monopoly. I pray that God will liberate my people from the clutches of these modern day colonial masters.
“I have written to the Executive Governor of the state concerning these issues and hope for an exhaustive and comprehensive investigation to forestall a breakdown of law and order in our community.”
