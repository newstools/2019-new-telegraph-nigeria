Public affairs analyst, Carl Umegboro has admonished the members of the 9th National Assembly to demonstrate statesmanship while discharging legislative functions in the interests of the suffering masses in the country. Umegboro, in a statement to newsmen on Friday in Abuja on the masses’ expectations from the new Assembly, he said lawmakers must discharge their duties with high sense of patriotism, objectivity and responsibility adding that they will no longer be measured by number of bills passed but impacts on the masses.  “In fact, lawmakers should first and foremost, review forthwith the outrageous monthly-running costs of N13.5 million and other sundry allowances to reduce burdens on the economy for a boost in capital expenditures. “As distinguished senators and honourable members, let the term ‘budget-padding’ vamoose eternally from their psyche as President Muhammadu Buhari doggedly did to them on ‘Ghanamust- go’ bags since 2015.  This is time for objective engagements with the executive arm for significant achievements and not for selfish interests or show of power. “Again, the present lawmakers should avoid paying lips service to public interests.  Turning to the nation’s electoral process, Umegboro said: “Essentially, the Electoral Act which President Buhari declined assent few months prior to the election should be reviewed accordingly for re-presentation and in time unlike previously it was believably, maliciously and deficiently put together for selfish interests. “To be specific, the electoral system should be upgraded to a complete digital voting system against the long existed paperand- ink ballot system as done in many countries of the world for credible and cost- reflective elections.”  He also enjoined the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila to ensure that cordial relationship exists between the legislative and executive arm with productive engagements and dialogues.
