Red Star Express Plc has ventured into the cargo General Sales Agent services (GSA) as part of its expansion drive. According to a statement from the company’s management, the service, which was introduced in June 14th will help connect passenger baggages and packages from one airport location to another at a faster rate. The Group Managing Director, Red Star Express Plc, Dr. Olusola Obabori, said the company is focused on growth. “We are a company focused on growth, and part of our growth platform for the financial year is to work to a large extent with airlines on cargo consolidation both locally and internationally,” he said. “With this in mind, we commenced a partnership with Aero Contractors, and we have ongoing discussions with other airlines, which of course, will start soon in the course of the business. “We are aggressive in terms of expansion, and this is the reason we started operations in some West Africa offices few months ago, some of which are Niger Republic, Burkina Faso, Benin Republic. If we have to expand, we have to be able to connect shipments from Lagos to these countries. “We are hopeful that we are going to open more offices around West Africa, as much as we do that, in the near future we are going into Aviation as a matter of fact, but for now, we are working with the operators of airlines in Nigeria to help them see how we can consolidate cargo since that’s our core business. We will consolidate locally to give to them, but we will also consolidate internationally for operators on International routes,” Obabori said. Besides, he said: “Our international business is principally done on the FedEx platform and we have Red Star Freight that does major cargo movement from here to the rest of the world and also bring in cargo into Nigeria. The GSA is a component of our expansion plan, which we recently introduced. This will bring lots of help in the industry. We have opened international operations, which are to show you that beyond the domestic market, there’s a lot we can do for Nigeria in the West Africa sub-region. This is why we also went into those markets. “This means if you are a business man in Nigeria and need to drop shipments in those locations, it will be delivered the next day, as if you are delivering goods to Kano or Kaduna. More so, with the introduction of the GSA, we can ride behind the airline operators to get these goods delivered on time. It makes the whole process extremely seamless and of course business can go faster. Nigeria is not our only market, we have gone West African,” he noted.
Similarly the Chief Operating Officer, Red Star Freight, Mr. Mudiaga Okumagba also commenting on the initiative said:
