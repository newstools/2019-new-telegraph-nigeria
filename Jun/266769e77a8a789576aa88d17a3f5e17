Nigerian music act and actor, Falz, has stated that he has a preference for spirituality over religion. In a recent interview with Silverbird Television, Falz, who caused controversy with one of his latest videos, “This is Nigeria” last year, revealed this as one of the reasons he doesn’t fancy going to church much. “I’m not an atheist. I believe there is a God. But I believe in spirituality over religion. I have nothing against the church or going to church. Everyone has the right to practice the religion they desire. It has been a while that I have been to church. It does not make me less of a Christian,” the son of human rights lawyer, Femi Falana, who trained as a lawyer himself, said. Going more direct while sharing a few instances, Falz added: “The reason is that I went to a few churches and, during sermons, I was put under undue pressure. There was a time that a pastor called me to the altar just to acknowledge my presence for being in church. In my mind, I felt that the service was not about me. “I felt that everybody was there to worship God, yet they were putting undue pressure on me. The pastor gave me the microphone to address the congregation and I was puzzled; what did he expect me to say to the congregation?”
Falz is not the first Nigerian entertainer to frown on going to church due to what is considered the overbearing attention that could end up being paid to them instead of focusing whatever is being done in church. The Okoye twins of now defunct PSquare, said the same thing around five years ago, claiming that they stopped going to church because other members of the congregation ended up paying more attention to them than what was being done in church.
