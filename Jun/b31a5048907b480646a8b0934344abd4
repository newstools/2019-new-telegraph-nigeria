The Niger State acting Chief Judge, Honourable Justice Ahmed Alhaji Bima, over the weekend, sets 62 inmates free. At least 35 of the freed inmates were from the old prison, while 27 were from the new prison. Both prisons are in Minna, Niger State capital. Bima during his tour of the prisons, also freed 13 inmates for good conducts, while six were discharged for lesser offences and lack of records. The remaining eight, who had less than three months remaining in their terms, were granted pardon in addition to the 35 inmates freed in the old prison on Thursday last week, making it a total of 62 inmates. While calling on magistrates to ensure that all bailable offences were granted, to avoid congestion, Bima ensured that 33 of the inmates in the new prison were given summary trial, and two were granted bail. Our correspondent gathered that 157 inmates were in the prison custody at the capacity cell of 50, which comprises of 11 already condemned to death, seven to life sentences, 44 were on awaiting trial and 95 were convicted of various jail terms. The CJ, during his visit to the old prison frowned at Prisons congestion, whereby capacity of 149 inmates is currently having 493 inmates. In total, 397 males are on awaiting trial with additional 10 females, while 84 were convicted.
