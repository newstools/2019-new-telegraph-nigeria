Two car dealers, Razak Olayinka and Amoo Ganiyu, who allegedly obtained N1.3 million under false pretences, on Monday appeared before an Igbosere Magistratesâ€™ Court in Lagos. Olayinka, 52, and Ganiyu, 57, whose addresses were not provided in court, are standing trial on a four-count charge bordering on fraud. The duo, however,  pleaded not guilty to the charge preferred against them by the police. Earlier, the prosecutor, Insp. Philip Osijale, told the court that the defendants committed the alleged offences sometime in February at Gbosem area of Lekki Phase 1 in Lagos State. He said that the duo fraudulently obtained N1.3 million from the complainant, Mr Adamu Umaru, on the pretext of selling a Mazda sport car to him. He said the duo could not repay the N1.3 million after failing to sell the car to the complainant. According to the prosecutor, the defendants also conducted themselves in a manner likely to cause breach of peace. The offences contravened Sections 168 (d), 287, 314 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The Magistrate, Mrs O. O. Otitoju granted the defendants bail in the sum of N200, 000 each with two sureties each in like sum. Otitoju ordered that one of the sureties must be a relative of the defendant and the other, a clergyman. She adjourned the case until June 26 for mention. (NAN)
