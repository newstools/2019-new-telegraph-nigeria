Mr Audu Umar (21) has killed his neighbour, Abubakar Muhammadu, for making sexual advances at his wife, Hassana Audu. Umar, after killing Muhammadu of Fulani Camp, Wawa village, New- Bussa, Borgu Local Government Area of Niger State, explained that such sexual move was a taboo in their tradition. The Niger State Police Command yesterday confirmed the arrest of the suspect by a team of policemen attached to the New-Bussa Division for murder. Umar was alleged to have killed the deceased for allegedly making sexual advances at his wife, which he insisted was against their tradition. Umar confirmed that he killed Muhammadu with a machete. He added: “I don’t regret killing him because he decided to die like a chicken. In his next world, he wouldn’t make advances towards married women. I’m ready to bear the consequences. So, let the law takes its course. I am fulfilled. Muhammadu will never see my wife again. Allah will judge him.”  It was gathered that sometime in May 2019, the suspect’s wife, Hassana, reported to him that Muhammadu had been disturbing her for a relationship, which she refused. It was further alleged that Umar went to warn Muhammadu to desist from such behaviour towards his wife, but the latter allegedly refused to heed the warning. This made Umar to attack the deceased with a machete, inflicting deep cuts on his head, which eventually led to the death of Muhammadu. The Niger State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), a Deputy Superintendent Police (DSP), Mohammad Abubakar, said that the matter would be charged to court after investigation.
