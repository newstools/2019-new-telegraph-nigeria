A 100 level female student of the Plateau State University (PLASU), Bokkos, was shot dead while another one was raped when suspected herdsmen attacked the school on Sunday.
The university has in the past suffered a series of attacks by herdsmen.
The Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof Yohana Daniel Izam, confirmed the attack in a statement signed by the institution’s Public Relations Officer (PRO).
According to the statement, the incident left the 100 level student of Geography dead, after sustaining gunshot injury.
The statement reads in part: “The Vice Chancellor regrets the demise of the promising student, particularly after a successful matriculation held at the university last Friday. Professor Izam, on behalf of the university community and management of the institution, is deeply vexed by this act of man’s inhumanity to man and sincerely extends the deepest sympathy of the management to the deceased’s parents.”
The VC appealed for calm and cooperation, especially among the students as the campus security committee, in collaboration with the Special Task Force, had since swung into action to review the situation, with a view of identifying the perpetrators of the crime.
The students on their part called on government and school management to put an end to the incessant attacks and harassment by the herdsmen.
Some of the students said the school was at high risk, considering how criminal acts are carried out without arrest of culprits.
The students said they were vulnerable as the area is extremely volatile, leaving them at the mercy of the attackers.
