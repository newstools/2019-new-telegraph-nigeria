…as Super Eagles’ camp opens  Super Eagles captain, Mikel Obi, was one of the early arrivals at the national team camp in preparation for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations scheduled to take place in Egypt later this month. The camp which opened in Asaba, Delta State, on Sunday saw the returning midfielder leading nine others as they began the final training camp for the AFCON. Mikel, 32, last played for the Super Eagles at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, but made his return to the team following productive talks with coach Gernot Rohr, on the back of a decent six-month spell at Middlesbrough. Rohr has invited 25 players to camp with three others on standby for the competition as the Nigeria team target their fourth title in Egypt. Among those in camp as at the time of going to press on Sunday were defenders Leon Balogun, Jamilu Collins, Chidozie Awaziem and Semi Ajayi. Mikel was joined in the camp by other midfielders like Oghenekaro Etebo and John Ogu while the attackers in camp are Samuel Kalu, Simon Moses and Victor Oshimen. Super Eagles will face Zimbabwe in one of their preparation games for the AFCON finals at the Stephen Keshi Stadium on June 8 before departing the country for Ismaila, Egypt for their final camp ahead of the tournament, where they will also face the Teranga Lions of Senegal on June 16 in another friendly. On June 17, the Super Eagles are expected in Alexandria, the venue of their Group B games. They open their campaign with Burundi on June 22 before clashes against Guinea and Madagascar on June 26 and June 30 respectively.
