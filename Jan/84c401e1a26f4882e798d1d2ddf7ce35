Popular Nollywood actress, Cossy Orjiakor, on Sunday revealed that her goal for 2019 is to be a housewife or baby mama with little workload and lots of shopping.  Orjiakor, who made this known in a post on her Instagram handle, disclosed that she did not accomplish all she had set to achieve in the outgoing year 2018.  She added that she was depressed in 2018, and looked stressed in all her movies and even musical videos. “This year 2018… I did not achieve all I marked out for myself.  Then depression sets in. I am depressed for minor things like not meeting up with the number of movies I set to produce each year.  “Come to think of it I look terrible in my own movies cause I look stressed when producing and relating with people.  “Then the music thing. I look stressed in my music video too hopefully Avalon Okpe will do the magic. I look stressed each time I use my brain. “So Next year 2019 God’s willing I just want to be eve; a woman with simple workload.  I just want to be a housewife or house babymama with simple job like shopping, having sex, then massaging someone and getting massaged with oil every night. #2019goals,” she wrote.
