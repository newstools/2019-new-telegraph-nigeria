…burn 10 vehicles, rob convoy  Nigerian envoy to the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, Alhaji Hassan Ardo Jika, and the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Taraba State, Alhaji Sani Abubakar Danladi, yesterday escaped death when youths in Wukari, suspected to be loyal to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) attacked their convoy in Wukari Local Government Area. The incident occurred when Danladi, who is currently on campaign tour of the southern zone of the state, was on his way to Ibi Local Government and his convoy ran into the youth who barricaded the Ibi roundabout area of Wukari. The youth, who were armed with dangerous weapons, opened fire on the convoy and injured several persons. They subsequently burnt down about 10 vehicles and looted personal belongings of the occupants who had fled the vehicles. As at the time of this report, the whereabouts of the APC governorship candidate and the ambassador could not be ascertained as some of the persons on the convoy had escaped to the police area command in Wukari. The state APC Publicity Secretary, Mr. Aaron Artimas, who was at the scene of the incident, said it was a well-organised attack orchestrated by the PDP government in the state. He said: “While we were on our way to Wukari, we got information that (someone) sponsored some youths to burn down APC billboards and facilities in the area. So it is not surprising that they have taken their frustration to this extent of organising the youth to attack our convoy and attempt to assassinate the ambassador and our governorship candidate.” Artimas said about 10 vehicles in the convoy were looted and burnt down while several others were vandalised. The Divisional Police Officer in Wukari could not be reached to comment on the issue as tension was too high at the time of this report. The state police public relations officer refused to pick his calls.
