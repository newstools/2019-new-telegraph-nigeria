The fast rising music star is sure enjoying bliss at his record label “Etins Record” amidst speculations that he dished the record label.  A source close to the artiste revealed that he is been pressured by some selfish individuals to abandon his label that took him from grassroot to stardom but he believes the artiste is wise enough not to make such an ungrateful decision as that could mean doomsday for his budding career.  According to our source, barely six months after he signed up with the label, he has released two visuals. One for his hit song ‘wetin we gain’ and another for his new song titled “No idea “. These songs are well promoted globally.  The source also disclosed that, the label surprised him this December by purchasing a Mercedes Benz 4matic sedan car for him.  This car has since been delivered to the furnished apartment provided by the label. This shows that the label is indeed out to make the artiste comfortable and happy, which will make him focus on his career and further develop himself.  We also learnt that the artiste is working tirelessly on some new songs and collaboration that will send his fans into frenzy in the coming year and broaden his fan base.
