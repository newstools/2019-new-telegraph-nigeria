Red has always been a very sexy colour and unlike fashion, it doesnâ€™t change with the times.  On the contrary, it gets even more popular as the years go by. Even this era that is filled with fashion forward and fearless brides, we get to see brides rock sexy dresses on their special day.  Those who do not do so as their outfits, incorporate it in their colour scheme.  Red carpets, however, permit you to knock yourself out and bring out the best of your fashion creativity. Some people prefer to be safe and hire stylists to dress them up on such occasions.  C h o o s e what you pair your r e d outfits w i t h , b a s e d on the occasion and the style you hope to achieve.  Red is also a colour of power as it is considered a colour of danger too. It should most importantly fit your body type and if you are so inclined, your personality too! Be assured that no one ever wore a red outfit and got lost in the crowd!
