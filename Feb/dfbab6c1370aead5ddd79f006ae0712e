A trader, John Ageh, 38, on Tuesday appeared at an Ikeja Magistratesâ€™ Court in Lagos, charged with obtaining N3.85 million from two men under false pretenses. Ageh, who resides at No. 88, Odunsi St., Bariga, Lagos, is standing trial on a two-count charge of fraud and stealing. The prosecutor, Insp. Edet Akadu, told the court that Ageh committed the offences on June. 16, 2018, at No. 16, Abolade St., Ojuwoye, Mushin, Lagos. Akadu said that the accused fraudulently obtained N700, 000 and N3.15 million from the complainants, Vincent Eminike and Lotana Okugbor on pretext of supplying them herbal drinks called Mudet, which he never did. He said that Ageh intentionally swindled the complainants as he failed to refund their money. The offences, the prosecutor said, contravened Sections 287 and 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. However, the accused denied committing the offences. The Magistrate, Mr K. O. Ogundare, granted Ageh N250, 000 bail with two responsible sureties in the like sum. He said that the sureties should be gainfully employed, show evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State Government and have their addresses verified. Ogundare adjourned the case until Feb. 21, for mention. (NAN)
