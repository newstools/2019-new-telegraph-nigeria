The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) said that it had successfully repaired and energized a 150MVA 330/132kV power transformer, which got burnt five years ago in Kumbotso Transmission Substation. TCN, which said this in a statement, sad this is the first time TCN in-house engineers are successfully undertaking such repair work on a badly burnt 150MVA capacity power transformer and restoring it to service. It is also an indication of the growing capacity of its engineers under the present administration. The statement, which was issued by the General Manager, Public Affairs, Mrs. Ndidi Mbah, TCN, said that the Kum-botso Transmission Substation had four 150MVA power transformers. Five years ago, one of the transformers got burnt and was considered irreparable and on the 1st of January this year, a second 150MVA tripped on fault with investigations revealing that its winding coil had spoilt and had to be moved to a transformer repair factory in Lagos. To ensure that Kano Disco load centers taking supply from this substation still receive supply for its customers, TCN first re-arranged load from the tripped transformer into the two (2) 150MVA transformers and then commenced work on the burnt 150MVA power transformer on the 2nd of January, using its in-house engineers.
