Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON), Mr. Ahmed Kuru yesterday in Abuja pledged that the Corporation would continue to seek improved collaboration with Estate Surveyors and Valuers Registration Board of Nigeria (ESVARBON) because of the critical role they play in asset sales.
Kuru, said this when he received a delegation from ESVARBON led by its Chairman, Sir Nweke Umezuruike, according to statement from the corporation. He stated that such collaboration with the sister agency is needed this time in the life of AMCON given the pile up of assets, which AMCON has to sell to meet its mandate at the end of the day. He said: “Valuers determine a lot of what we do in terms of assets sale. We therefore consider ESVARBON as key stakeholders in our recovery mandate and will always encourage this sort of interaction. That is why I have always said that conservativeness is very key in the valuation business because it is critical to how we (AMCON) go about the disposal of the assets we have in our portfolio. We have always engaged your members and we will continue to engage them to handle our valuations and the reports they come up with affect our decisions.
“So, we will continue to work with ESVARBON because your job as estate valuears have both negative and positive impact on AMCON.” The AMCON boss also used the occasion to express AMCON’s main concern, which has to do with quacks in the sector, which makes it difficult to get the right valuation of assets most of the time. Kuru said it would be in the interest of AMCON, ESVARBON and the public if unqualified practitioners that litter every state of the federation as members of ESVARBON were eliminated.
