 Former African Footballer of the Year, Nwankwo Kanu, has said Super Eagles players must develop a strong and winning mentality that will enable them to fly when African Cup of Nations takes centre stage in in Egypt. Kanu said Nigeria was a big country in world football and the team must protect the integrity of the most-populous black nation by winning the AFCON title.
“For me, we are Nigerians, we have to know who we are, that’s the first thing in life, “he said “Countries around the world become shaky when they hear they want to play against Nigeria in any tournament, so why do we give way to fear and become frightened as well? “My advice to the players is that they must have at the back of their minds that they are representing the biggest nation in the world. They must know that the green and white jersey they are putting on represents millions of Nigerians so when they have that spirit.”
The former Arsenal striker described the Super Eagles squad as a perfect blend of young and talented players who are destined for greatness. “I like this set of squad because the players are all of about the same level and they are all very good. If you take anyone out, the ones on the bench are as good as those on the pitch. “Another thing I like about this team is that they are very young. Age is very much on their side. They don’t have any superstar and they are doing very well. “The team spirit is very high. Look at the records; they have been doing well without a superstar. It’s left for the coach to manage the squad and select the best players,” he said.
