Scientists in the United States (U.S.) have said that heavy smoking may actually damage colour and contrast vision, leading to damaged vision.  This was made known in a new study published recently in the journal; ‘Psychiatry Research.’ To this end, Co-Author of the study, Steven Silverstein, said the result of the study also suggested that research into vision problems in other groups of people, such as those with   schizophrenia, who often smoked heavily, should take into account their smoking rate. Silverstein is the Director of Research at Rutgers University’s Behavioral Healthcare Centre in the American state of New Jersey.  Tobacco smoke contains more than fifty chemicals that cause cancer while tobacco use is the single greatest cause of preventable death globally. As many as half of people who use tobacco die from complications of tobacco use. The World Health Organisation  (WHO) estimated that each year, tobacco causes about six million deaths (about 10 per cent of all deaths) with 600,000 of these occurring in non-smokers due to second hand smoke.  In the 20th century tobacco was estimated to have caused 100 million deaths. Participants in the study were 71 healthy people aged 25 to 45 and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.  While some of the participants smoked fewer than 15 cigarettes in their lives, 63 people who smoked more than 20 cigarettes a day were also part of the study. The research team found that the heavy smokers showed significant changes in their redgreen and blue-yellow colour vision and also had greater difficulty discriminating contrasts and colours than non-smokers. Silverstein said: “Our results indicate that excessive use of cigarettes, or chronic exposure to their compounds, affects visual discrimination, supporting the existence of overall deficits in visual processing with tobacco addiction.
