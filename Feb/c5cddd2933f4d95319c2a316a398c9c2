South Africa has declared its desire to have more Chinese tourists explore its destination in a bid to boost its tourist traffic. According to South Africa Minister of Tourism, Derek Hanekom, in a report by Eturbonews.com, the country wants to attract more Chinese visitors and is striving to make their travel easier and more enjoyable. Hanekom disclosed this during a Chinese New Year celebration held by the Chinese embassy, revealing that about 100,000 Chinese tourists visit the country annually, but “we could massively grow this number,” he said. In 2018, South Africa and China signed memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on visa facilitation and simplification for Chinese business and leisure travellers to promote tourism. Hanekom said this was one step toward making it easier for Chinese travellers to get visa to South Africa. He revealed that South African government is considering issuing 10-year-multiple-entry visa and e-visa to Chinese tourists. Department of Home Affairs is exploring the possibility of recognising prior or other visa in Chinese passport, such as Schengen visa, U.S. visa or Australian visa. He also promised that the visa applicationapproval process will be reduced to five days. As for the safety problem, Hanekom said, “We are all aware of the challenge. We’re taking it very seriously.” The government is fighting crime and corruption harshly, those places that visitors typically visit are “safe by any international standard.” The minister further said that some local guides and hotel waiters had been taught Mandarin to enhance Chinese visitors’ experience. The training will be extended to more people in the next few years. “South Africa offers a range of wildlife experiences and amazingly diverse cultural and heritage offering that not many countries can match,” Hanekom said. “We extend a warm welcome to them (Chinese) to include South Africa in their travel plans.”
