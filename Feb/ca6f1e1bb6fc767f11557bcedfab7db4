 A Professor of Radiology at the College of Medicine University Of Nigeria Nsukka, Ifeoma Okoye, has urged the three tiers of government to facilitate better access to cancer prevention and care for the citizens of the country.
She made this known in her statement on the World Cancer Day, marked globally on February 4, to raise awareness on cancer. Okoye who is also the Founder of Breast Without Spot, called on the governments to engage with companies to purchase drugs as a strategy to ensure reduction in the prices of cancer medications with a view to making them more accessible and affordable for patients.
Okoye also said, that the government should provide more radiotherapy centers, while encouraging both private and public driven facilities in the provision of services, adding that governments should establish more efficient structures for the management of cancer with trusted national cancer registry and generating reliable data germane to Nigeria.  Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. These contrast with benign tumours, which do not spread to other parts of the body. Similarly, Okoye said people should adopt healthy lifestyle involving exercise at least 45 minutes three times weekly. Her words: “Be conscious about your food choices; choose natural healthy unprocessed carbohydrates, fruits and vegetables, reduce alcohol intake, avoid smoking, hydrate yourself with 70-80 per cent water and adopt better health-seeking behaviour.
“Be a cancer control advocate, contribute to patient treatment, support funds and join to advocate to government to provide more cancer treatment and care facilities.
