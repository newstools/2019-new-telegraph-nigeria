Deji Adeyanju, a political activist who has been in detention for 67 days has been granted bail by a Kano State High Court on Monday granted bail. Mr Adeyanju was freed on bail when his matter came up in Monday morning, with a condition that he must provide sureties and N500,000, according to his lawyers. Mr Adeyanju was arrested on December 13 over allegations he was involved in a murder in Kano in 2005. The previous acquittal and policeâ€™s failure to arraign Mr Adeyanju for several weeks after arresting him fueled speculation that his detention was politically motivated.
