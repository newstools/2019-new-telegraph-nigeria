Undeniably, Buhari is admired by many for his uprightness and anti-corruption stand, but the fame did not come that easy. The moral revolution anchored on the War Against Indiscipline (WAI), which he introduced as a military leader had remained a national phenomenon and reference point for decades. Though military governments were aberration at the time he and the late Brig. General Tunde Idiagbon sacked the then government of President Shehu Shagari; history had been fair to him for the high level of discipline and patriotism, which he exhibited in leading the nation. Till date, Buhari is yet to allow that anti-corruption posture to wane. His government was revered for its ability to keep the country afloat by making progress through sheer economic ingenuity even when it rejected the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan; refused to devalue the Naira; curbed imports of needless goods; curtailed oil theft and used a counter trade policy to barter seized illegally bunkered crude oil for needful goods like machineries. His administrative style and transparency was also lauded by many Nigerians when he headed the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF). The agency (though scrapped) is still credited for impacting on the lives of the people through impleallmentation of several developmental projects.
