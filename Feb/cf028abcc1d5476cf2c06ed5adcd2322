1st Battalion of Nigerian Army, Dukku Barracks in Birnin- Kebbi, Kebbi State, was thrown into mourning as the remains of Corporal Ibrahim Attahiru, was buried at the military cemetery in Birnin- Kebbi in accordance with Islamic rites. Attahiru was reportedly killed by the convoy of the state deputy governor last weekend. The incident, which occurred at a stop-andsearch point on Koko- Jega highway about 10p.m. on Friday, also left another soldier seriously wounded. It occurred when the convoy of the deputy governor was returning to Birnin-Kebbi after a political campaign trip to Zuru Emirate Council in Kebbi South Senatorial District. However, the Director of Research and Documentation in the office of the deputy governor, Aliyu Jajirma, who blamed the unfortunate incident on poor visibility, said the wounded soldier was immediately rushed to the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) for urgent attention. He added that the lack of signal or light indicating security check-point was largely responsible for the accident.
