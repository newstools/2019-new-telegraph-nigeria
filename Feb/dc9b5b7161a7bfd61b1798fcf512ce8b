Abuja National Stadium pitch, which used to host Super Eagles home matches, has now been turned into a waste dump of sort and a complete eyesore.  The main pitch that has been under renovation for over two years has now been abandoned by the contractor and serves as waste dump, New Telegraph has learnt.  A visit by our correspondent on Monday revealed that the pitch which had been overgrown with weeds now accommodates used water bottles, polythene bags, other wastes with some dangerous reptiles having a field day.  Some portions of the pitch have been completely burnt by the dry harmattan haze while other parts have been choked up by weeds.  In a response, the Permanent Secretary Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, Olusade Adesola, said their budget in a year was not enough to take care of the facility hence the decision to concession the stadium to a private organization.  He said: “The annual budget of the ministry cannot take care of the entire facility. Besides, electricity supply to the stadium is erratic, so we find it difficult to water the pitch regularly.  “Our plan is to concession it along with the National Stadium Lagos to private organisations for proper maintenance.”  Our visit yesterday revealed that not only the pitch suffers neglect; the sitting arenas that are always dusted by cleaners after tournaments have not been touched since the complex hosted the last National Sports Festival.  Efforts to get the Director of Facilities and the Stadium Manager at Package on to react the issue proved abortive as they were not around when our correspondent visited their offices.  Our correspondent also learnt that the regrassing of the pitch was awarded to a contractor who was said to be a kinsman of a top official in the ministry of sports two years ago.  However, there were insinuations that the contractors abandoned the job despite collecting money largely due to lack of expertise to handle such project.
