Succour came the way of residents of impacted communities during the Niger Delta crises as the Presidential Amnesty Programme took a step from its core mandate with the distribution of various items as starter packs to the people as part of its empowerment programme. The exercise, which involved thousands of recipients drawn from various communities in Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta, Edo, CrossRivers, Imo, Ondo, Akwa Ibom and Abia states, commenced in Warri, Delta State on Friday, at the Wellington Hotel. About 177 persons profiled from various communities for each of the 20 distribution centres across states in the Niger Delta received items for various trade areas which included welding equipment, tailoring, catering, deep freezers, and generators of different sizes. Special Adviser to the President on Niger Delta and Coordinator, Amnesty Programme, Prof. Charles Dokubo, while kicking off the empowerment programme in Abonnema, Akuku-Toru Local Government Area of Rivers State, yesterday, said the gesture was a show of President Muhammadu Buhari’s love for people of the oil-rich region. He said: “Having served in Port Harcourt, Rivers State in the course of his military career, President Muhammadu Buhari is conversant with the unpleasant situation of the Niger Delta people and he is committed to turning around the narrative. President Buhari loves you and will ensure that the Niger Delta is stabilised and gets its right place in the country, especially in terms of infrastructural development.
