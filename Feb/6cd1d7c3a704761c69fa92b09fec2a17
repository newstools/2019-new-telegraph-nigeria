MFM FC defender, Jonathan Zikiye, has said the club will not get carried away despite their position at the top of the Nigeria Professional Football League. The Lagos-based side is currently leading Group A of the abridged season with 15 points from seven games. According to Zikiye, they are keeping their feet on the ground and will continue to grind out results as they fight for a top three finish so as to qualify for the Super Six at the end of the campaign. “Our last game against Niger Tornadoes was a difficult one, but we were able to get the victory needed,” he said. “We are not going to be carried away with our position because we still have a long way to go in the season. “We recorded our first away win against Remo Stars and we need to get more of that while also maintaining our home front because we can’t afford to make mistakes at home.” MFM will play their next game at home to Sunshine Stars of Akure on Wednesday as there will be no games this weekend due to the general election in the country.
