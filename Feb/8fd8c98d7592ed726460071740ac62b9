A policeman was shot dead yesterday in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, while chasing some robbers who had raided a business premises.
A witness said the robbers had earlier operated at a petrol station on Fajuyi-Secretariat Road and were escaping through the old Iyin-Ilawe Road when the policeman in a white Hilux van sighted them and gave them a hot chase.
The witness said the police van had trailed the bandits up to NTA Junction, where the robbers had laid an ambush for him.
“When the Hilux van chased them up to that point, the armed robbers used their vehicle to block the way and rained bullets on the car.
“The bullets hit the driver of the vehicle and died on the spot after which the robbers entered their car and sped off,” the witness said.
The sounds of the guns brandished by the bandits were said to have caused confusion within that vicinity.
Policemen later visited the scene to evacuate the corpse and deposited it at the morgue of the Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital (EKSUTH).
When called for confirmation, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Caleb Ikechukwu, said the attack on the police officer could have been a reaction of criminal elements to the cleansing operation being carried out by the command.
He said: “You know that since our new Police Commissioner, Mr. Asuquo Amba, came on board, he introduced a Joint Task Force carrying out Operation Make Ekiti Safe and many criminals had either been arrested or killed in the process.”
