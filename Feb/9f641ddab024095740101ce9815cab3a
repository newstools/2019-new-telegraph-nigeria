 Ex-international, Joseph Dosu, has called on the Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, to give all the players in the national team equal opportunity for them to fight for a starting shirt in the team.
The Atlanta 1996 Olympic gold medalist said the decision to give a player the impression that no one can replace him in the team might allow for complacency to come in.
According to Dosu, there are some goalkeepers especially the home-based players doing well at the moment and he said they can as well give them opportunity, so they can all fight for the number one position.
He specifically mentioned former junior international, Dele Alampasu, who is currently making waves with Portuguese club, Feirense.
“I don’t know why someone like Alampasu has not been given opportunity in the team,” he said.
“I am not saying this because I know him, all the goalkeepers in the national team are like brothers to me. We have Alampasu, (Francis) Uzoho, (Ikechukwu) Ezenwa, Dele Ajiboye and Theophilous Afelokhai, if all these guys can be called together, let them all fight for the number one shirt.
“They all know each other as they have been together in the national team at one time or the other, once they see their rivals, coming together, they will give their best.
“But if you are inviting two or three and you already made it clear that one is assured of the number one shirt, they will all be doing what they like. I think others should be given equal opportunity so that we can get the best out of them.”
