The Sokoto State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP),has rejected the results of the Presidential and National Assembly elections conducted last Saturday.  Addressing a press conference yesterday, ,the Chairman of the party, Alhaji Ibrahim Milgoma, also threatened to take court actions.  Milgoma, who described the entire process as fraudulent, said it took place with the aid of INEC and the police.  The party scribe also called for the outright cancellation as well sought for a rescheduling of the exercise where it was rigged as well where elections did not hold.  He maintained that the process and conduct of the elections were marred by rigging and unwarranted arrest of its agents, members and supporters across the state.  Milgoma alleged that the police, INEC officials and APC have conspired and disenfranchised the PDP supporters and leaders of the right to exercise their civic responsibility.  “Many of our leaders, supporters and party agents were intimidated, arrested and detained to pave way for APC to have a field day for election rigging.  “We are aware and have seen police personnel deployed from Abuja to come and carryout the unlawful task of denying voters their rights”, he stressed.
