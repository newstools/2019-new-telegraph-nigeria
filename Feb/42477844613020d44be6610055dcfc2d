A bricklayer, ThankGod Emmanuel, of Sauka-Kahuta area of Minna, Niger State, has been arrested for allegedly killing his co-worker over N47,000. The suspect, who was apprehended by a team of policemen attached to Tundun Wada Division, was said to have killed Tita Komla, of the same address, with digger. It was learnt that Komla’s brother, Tete Joe, of Katampe, Abuja, had earlier reported that his brother was working with the suspect in his construction company at Sauka-kahuta. He claimed that the suspect had called him on the phone to notify him that Komla had been killed by unknown persons. It was also learnt that the suspect engaged his victim in a physical combat, killed him with a digger, robbed him of his N47,000 and dumped his body inside the gutter. Emmanuel told our correspondent that he killed Komla with a digger in order to take his money. He said: “Komla did not know I wanted to rob him of his money. I killed him so that nobody will know that I stole his N47,000. I used digger to inflict injuries on his head and he died instantly. “I least suspected that police will identify me as the one who killed him. Well, it’s really unfortunate.” Confirming the incident, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Muhammad Abubakar, said the suspect confessed to have committed the crime. Abubakar also said that the suspect inflicted injuries on the head of his victim and made away with his money.
The PPRO added that the suspect would be arraigned soon.
