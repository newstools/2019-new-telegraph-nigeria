Paul Pogba was Manchester United’s top man in the 2-0 away victory over Chelsea on Monday night, sending his team to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. The Frenchman was a bit quiet in the first 20 minutes of the game, but then he became unstoppable. Pogba put a perfect cross in Chelsea’s box in the 31st minute and Ander Herrera with a clinical finish put the Red Devils in a one goal lead. Paul scored the second himself in the last minute of the first half. He used Marcus Rashford’s cross and headed the ball past Kepa Arrizabalaga. Manchester United won the game and went through to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. Pogba in a post-match interview with MUTV admitted that is still hurting from last season’s lack of silverware and said that Man United “want to win something” this season. Losing a game after 11 games without losing hurts and it’s a really bad feeling, so you don’t want this to happen again. All the competitions are important. We want to win something. Last year we didn’t win any trophies. I still remember that. This year we want to win something. The FA Cup may be the only trophy that Manchester United has a real chance to win. The Red Devils will face Wolverhampton away in the quarter final, which won’t be an easy game.
