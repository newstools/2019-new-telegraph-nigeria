Few days to the February 16 and March 2 elections, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has raised the alarm over plots by some persons to release fake results before the official announcement by the commission. Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, made this allegation yesterday in Abuja at a training workshop on “safety of journalists and conflicts sensitive reporting ahead of Nigeria’s election,” organized by the Media Foundation for West Africa and the International Media Support in conjunction with the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ).  He said: “The commission is worried about fake news and possibility of releasing results that are not genuine. INEC is worried that some mischievous persons may cash in on the avalanche of fake news and release results that are not from INEC before the announcement of the authentic result by the commission.”  The INEC chairman, who was represented by the assistant director (broadcast) of the commission, Mr. Chukwuemeka Ugboaja, explained that the commission was very concerned about the action of most bloggers and citizen journalists who post information in the social media without confir mation. He appealed to bloggers, citizens’ journalists and other media operators to endeavour to confirm any information concerning the elections from the relevant authorities and desist from releasing fake news to the public.
