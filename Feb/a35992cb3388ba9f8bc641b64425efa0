Eagles’ goalie gets €1,000 fine  Super Eagles goalkeeper, Francis Uzoho, has been suspended for a match by the Cypriot Football Association following his confession that he did not get any medical check before he was issued a health certificate by his new club Anorthosis Famagusta. Uzoho has been facing questions for alleged certificate forgery and after confessing that he was on the airplane to his new base when the medical certificate was issued, Cypriot FA suspended the 20-year-old for one match sequel to their ruling that he was ineligible to face Apollon Limassol on February 2. The verdict also affected Anorthosis Famagusta, as the team that lodged the protest, Apollon Limassol, were awarded the three points from the match despite losing 1-0 as Uzoho was deemed ineligible for the match. In a 17-page ruling, the FA’s sports adjudicator ruled that Uzoho played the game with an invalid health certificate and awarded Apollon the win while docking Anorthosis six points. Uzoho was also handed a €1,000 fine, as Cyprus Sports Organization had initially declared his health certificate void as of February 9, but on Monday annulled it, stating that it considered the document “as never having been issued.” The matter, which rocked Cyprus for nearly two weeks, was raised after Apollon alleged that Uzoho’s health certificate was gained with forged medical documents, as it was issued hours before he arrived from Spain. Uzoho joined Anorthosis on loan from Spanish club Deportivo La Coruna on January 31, but Apollon argued that he did not get necessary medical examination for the health certificate to be valid.
