 Banks and other financial institutions in Nigeria generated a total of N114.27 billion as Value Added Tax (VAT) between 2014 and 2018, findings by New Telegraph show. According to the “Sectorial Distribution of Value Added Tax Q4 2018” report just released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), VAT generated by banks and other financial institutions in the last five years, however, makes up about 38.35 per cent of the sum of N298.01 billion generated as VAT in Q4 2018 alone. This newspaper’s analysis of the NBS report shows that while banks and other financial institutions generated a total of N26.91 billion as VAT in 2014, the figure was down to N23.06 billion in 2015. Although it rose to N25.05 billion in 2016, it headed south at N20.76 billion and N18.50 billion in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Further analysis of the report indicates that banks and other financial institutions generated the lowest amount of VAT –N3.94 billion – for the sector last year in Q4. For instance, in Q1 2018, the sector generated N5.30 billion as VAT; the figure was, however, down to N4.75 billion and N4.52 billion in Q2 and Q3 respectively.  Also, the study shows that the N18.50 billion generated by banks and other financial institutions in Q4 2018 makes up about 6.21 per cent of the total sum of N298.01 billion generated as VAT by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) during the period. In addition, this makes up only about 1.67 per cent of the total VAT of N1.11 trillion generated as VAT by the Service in 2018.  For Q4 2018, the NBS report states: “Other manufacturing generated the highest amount of VAT with N28.82 billion generated and closely followed by Professional Services and Commercial and Trading both generating N24.12 billion and N16.02 billion respectively, while Mining generated the least and closely followed by Pharmaceutical, Soaps & Toiletries and Chemical, Paints and Allied Industries with N35.75 million, N209.33 million and N258.39 million generated respectively.”  According to the VAT Act (2004), all banks and financial institutions, except Community banks, Peoples Bank and Mortgage Institutions, are required to charge VAT on services rendered by them to their customers and account for same to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS).
Analysts note that while the focus of VAT is on the charges levied on customers for the consumption of services rendered by banks, disagreements often arise between lenders and their customers over what constitutes a vatable service.  An official of FIRS, who did not want to be identified, told this newspaper that while all charges arising from the services of banks and financial institutions will ordinarily attract VAT, an easy way of determining whether a service is vatable or not is to identify those activities that constitute return on investment as distinct from those that represent consumption of services.  According to the official, the services of banks and other financial institutions that do not attract VAT include: Interest on loans/advances and overdraft facilities; interest on savings accounts; interest on bank deposits; dividends; interbank placements and Profit/gain on disposal of government securities as well as premium on insurance policies.  Last month, the Executive Chairman, FIRS, Mr. Tunde Fowler, disclosed that the Service was automating the collection of VAT in key sectors to facilitate reduction in compliance cost in the long term, apart from system to system integration between banks and the FIRS.  He noted that VAT collection in the banks increased by about 31 per cent year-on-year between January 2017 and December 2018, with about N25 billion collected so far.  The FIRS boss, who announced that the Service collected about N5.320 trillion as revenues in 2018, the highest in the country’s history,” said its target for 2019 is about N8 trillion.  Interestingly, the Minister of Finance, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, recently hinted that the country’s VAT rate is likely to be increased from five per cent this year as part of the Federal Government’s Strategic Revenue Growth Initiative aimed at generating more revenues to finance national development.  “We are studying a possibility of a VAT increase, but you also know that the increase of VAT requires an amendment of a law. It is most likely the VAT increase will be selective,” the minister said. “It will be on special items so it won’t be across the board.  “I am sure you are already aware that there are a number of items that are exempted from VAT such as food and drugs.  “There would be a VAT increase during the course of 2019, we will announce later the items and what the rate will be.  “We will have to take a request to the National Assembly for amendment of the VAT law before it takes effect.”
