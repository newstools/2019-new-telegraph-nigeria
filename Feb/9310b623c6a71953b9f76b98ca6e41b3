Aim Higher Africa, the education non-profit organisation founded by British/Ghanaian media entrepreneur and Forbes Africa Executive, Peace Hyde was recently profiled on Fox News for its impactful work transforming impoverished communities. Over the years, the organisation has grown from having a focus on rehabilitating street children by providing them with basic education including literacy, science and maths to empowering unemployed youths and grassroots entrepreneurs by providing them with vocational skills and support to create businesses and job opportunities for their communities. Throughout that time, the organization has invested in over 3000 startups from grassroots entrepreneurs and its proprietary mindset reorientation and design thinking program has reached over 3 million students across the African continent. The organization is poised to replicate the success of its vocational training and skills acquisition program where students are given trade and digital skills as well as an interest free start-up capital across local communities in Ghana and Nigeria for 2019.
