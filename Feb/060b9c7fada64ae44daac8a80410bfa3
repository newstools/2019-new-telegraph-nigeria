President Muhammadu Buhari has always had good outings in the North-West, where he usually defeats his oppenents with wide margins during presidential elections. Can he re-enact this feat on February 16? GEOFFREY EKENNA takes a look at what will likely play out   When the Independent National Electoral Commission(INEC) opens the curtains for the 2019 general elections on Saturday, February 16, President Muhammadu Buhari, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, (APC) for the presidential election would be banking massively on his home zone, the North West
For the three times that he ran for the presidency before winning in 2015, Buhari maintained a cult followership in the northern part of the country. But his performance in his native North West, comprising Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Sokoto, Jigawa, Zamfara and Kaduna states have been tremendous.
Although, the Constitution stipulates a mandatory 25 per cent in at least two-thirds of the 36 states of the federation for the presidential candidate to emerge, the bulk votes needed to win the majority votes in the elections are domiciled in the North West zone.
Thus, being the largest voting block in the country with over 20 million of the 84 million votes on offer in the election, Buhari would hope to win the bulk of the votes in the zone, making it up with whatever he is able to gather in other parts of the country.
According to figures released by the INEC, the Northwest has the following distribution of votes according to states. Jigawa has 2,111,106; Kaduna 3,932,492; Kano 5,457,747; Katsina 3,230,230; Kebbi 1,806,231; Sokoto 1,903,166 and Zamfara 1,717,128
In the 2015 presidential election, Buhari convincingly won the North West, trouncing then President Goodluck Jonathan massively in the seven states. In Kano for instance, with 44 Local Governments and a total of 4,943,862 registered voters, Buhari polled a total of 1,903,999 votes while the PDP had 215,779 out of the 2,364,434 accredited voters and valid votes of 2,128,821
In Jigawa, out of the 1,153,428 accredited voters, Buhari had 885,988 and PDP had 142,904 of the total votes of 1,071,889.
In his native Kastina State, he scored 1,345,441 as against PDP’s 98,937. That was out of the 2,842,741 registered voters, 1,578,646 accredited voters and a total voters of 1,481,714.
He did not fail in Kaduna. Out of the registered voters of 3,361,793 and accredited voters of 1,746,031, APC scored 1,127,760 while PDP had 484,085.
Same was the case with Zamfara. Of the total registered voters of 1,484,941 and accredited 875,049 voters, Buhari had 612,202 while the PDP had 144, 833.
In Kebbi State, of the 1,457,763 registered voters and 792,817 accredited voters, APC had 567,883 while the PDP scored 100,972.
Buhari also won in Sokoto State with a total of 671,926 as against PDP’s 152,199. That was out of the 1,663,127 registered voters and accredited voters of 988,899.
With the bulk of the votes in the North West, Buhari was able to beat Jonathan conveniently, picking up votes from other zones of the country particularly in the South West, North East and the North Central zones of the country. He did not do well in the South East and South South zones where Jonathan held sway.
But with the 2019 presidential election few days away, can Buhari replicate the same magic in his zone? That is the million dollar question beckoning for answers.
For one, many observers think that Buhari might just win the zone but not with the same wide margin of 2015 elections. They believe that the fate of Buhari would be largely determined by his performance in the North West. Sources within the party said that if the APC’s votes drop in the area by way of the presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar, making serious inroads, Buhari might struggle in the election.
That is following uncertainties that have cropped up in the other five zones of the country regarding the re-election of the president.
Competent sources within the party informed New Telegraph that with over 20 million votes in the North-West, which the party hopes to win the majority, the president would need minimal votes from other zones of the country to secure a second term.
A source, who is an APC leader in the South-West, said: “If his votes drop in the North-West, he will not be re-elected. But if he is able to muster a large vote in the zone as expected, then, we will only need some pockets of votes from other regions to win. We are sure that he will get 25 per cent of votes in as many states as we need but the votes from the North-West is the most crucial for us. He must do well in that one to win re-election.”
He pointed out that it would be hard for the ruling party to sweep the North Central, South-West and North-East as it did in 2015, owing to some realities that have come up since after the election.
For one, the fact that the president is running against a fellow northerner in the election could be a stumbling block as against 2015, when the whole North wanted the presidency badly and queued up against then President Goodluck Jonathan.
In 2019, Buhari would be facing Atiku from Adamawa in the North-East. Both Buhari and Atiku are not only from the North but are Muslims and command sizable following in the country. While Buhari is very strong in the North, Atiku, who also has followings there, is however stronger in the South.
Sources within APC said that while it was certain in the last election that the South-West was the swing zone that decided the election, same cannot be said now. The zone has over 14 million votes.
Though the six South-West states are controlled by the APC, some members of the party in the zone are vehemently opposed to Buhari’s re-election over what they described as ill treatment of the party’s National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, in the first two years of the Buhari presidency by a “cabal” within the presidency.
Another leader of the party in the zone stated: “If Tinubu, the arrowhead of the struggle to dislodge Jonathan in 2015 could be treated so shabbily when they were on their first term, you can imagine what would happen when Buhari wins a second term and they would not need any other support from the zone. All of us would end up in prison. We strongly believe that the people in the presidency will become more ruthless if the president wins a second term.”
Yet, another leader of the party told New Telegraph that they are not putting their eggs in one basket like the South-East did with Jonathan in 2015. “If Atiku wins, we will realign. We can’t stop Atiku’s votes here or in any other part of the country but for sure, we are working hard to ensure victory for our party. But we also know that Atiku has the capacity to win the election. So, we are keeping our cards open.”
The APC was boxed into a corner in the North Central with the killings by herdsmen. That was principally the reason Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, dumped the APC for the PDP.
States like Taraba and Plateau are also hit by the killings, straining the relationship between the Federal Government and the states. Although Plateau is presently controlled by APC, it is not certain how the president will fare there.
For different reasons though, Kogi and Kwara are believed not to be in the hands of APC. Senate President, Bukola Saraki controls Kwara and has more than a passing influence in Kogi.
It was further gathered that the APC is not quite hopeful about the South-East and the South-South even though some governors of the two zones have been hobnobbing with the presidency of recent.
But, sources within the party believe very strongly that “such governors would be going against the sentiments of their people if they work for Buhari’s victory.”
In the South-East for instance, only Governor Willy Obiano of Anambra State and Rochas Okorocha of Imo are openly in favour of Buhari. But the governors of Enugu, Abia and Ebonyi states are all PDP governors and are likely to work for their party. But the fact that Peter Obi, the vice presidential candidate of the PDP hails from Anambra could be an obstacle for Obiano.
The same scenario is expected to play in the South-South, where five of the six states, save Edo are controlled by the PDP.
In the North-East, APC leaders are banking on Borno, Yobe and Bauchi as possible areas of victory. But in Bauchi State, the defection of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara has complicated matters for the ruling party. While Adamawa is controlled by the APC, it is not clear if the state will ditch Atiku, who hails from there for Buhari.
The governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Ganduje, has often repeated that his state will deliver at least five million votes for Buhari in 2019. Katsina has also promised about two million votes.
The South-West has about 14.6 million votes; South-South, 11.1 million; South-East, 8.2 million; North Central, 10.6 million and North-East, 9.9 million.
Reacting to the calculation, the PDP said it is not doing any permutation because Nigerians across board are behind its presidential candidate.
The party’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, who spoke with our correspondent, said the 2019 presidential election would be an expression of dissatisfaction of Nigerians, who have suffered so much in the hands of the Buhari government.
“Nigerians who have suffered hunger and starvation under the APC government will be united in voting out this corrupt and incompetent APC government,” he said.
Ologbondiyan dismissed the allegation that some PDP governors are working for the re-election of President Buhari. “Why should they work for him? Number one, he is not a member of our party; they don’t have the same agenda with APC government.”
According to him, in 2003, when then Alliance for Democracy (AD) governors in South West, abandoned their party and worked for the re-election of then President Olusegun Obasanjo, they paid dearly for that, noting that no governor will take such risk again.
“Our governors are paying salaries. Our governors are executing people-oriented projects compared to APC governors. Our governors are people-oriented; governors of APC are worshiping one man. Our governors know that working for President Buhari could be suicidal,” he said.
Going by results of the 2011 and 2015 presidential elections, the PDP and Atiku have a tough job surmounting Buhari in his fortress. In the 2011 elections for instance, while the PDP, which was the government in power then scored a total of 3,395,724 in the zone, Buhari, then the Congress for Progressive Change(CPC) scored a total of 6,453,437 in the zone, giving him a large dominance in the zone. Even outside government, Buhari’s strangle hold on the north has seen him with massive votes in the three previous elections he participated in . He has a domineering influence in the zone. But in those elections, he battled against Jonathan in 2011 and 2015, Yar’Adua in 2007.
In the 2011 election, Buhari defeated Jonathan again in the whole of the North West. In Jigawa, Jonathan scored 491,252 votes against Buhari’s 663,994; Kaduna, 1,190,179 against Buhari’s 1,334,244 ; Kano, 440,666 against 1,624,543; Katsina, 428,392 against 1,163,919; Kebbi, 369,198 against 501,453; Sokoto, 309,057 against 540,769 and Zamfara, 238,180 against Buhari’s 624,515
In the 2007 presidential election, Buhari, then candidate of the ANPP lost to Yar’Adua of the PDP by a wide margin. While Yar’Adua had 24,638,063 or 69.82 per cent of the votes, Buhari had 6,605,299 or 18.72 per cent of the total votes cast. Instructively, the bulk of Buhari’s votes came from the North West.
The big question remains if Buhari has enough goodwill after nearly four years on the saddle to trounce Atiku and the PDP in 2019 with a wide margin in his zone, which has remained his fortress.
But with Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto gone to the PDP, the problem of the APC in Zamfara, the alleged none support of Buhari by some traditional heads in the zone, the battle seems stronger now than ever. Will Buhari hold his zone? That might be the answer to his re-election.
