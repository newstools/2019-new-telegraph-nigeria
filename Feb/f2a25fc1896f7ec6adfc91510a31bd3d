Elders of Orlu, Imo state largest senatorial district have distanced themselves from what they described as electoral impunity allegedly perpetrated by their kinsman, Governor Rochas Okorocha during last Saturday’s Presidential and the National Assembly elections. In a consultation meeting between Orlu and Owerri elders ahead of the governorship election in the state, the Orlu Elders’ Council berated Okorocha for allegedly obstructing collation of elections’ results and intimidating voters during the election.  Chairman of the council, Prof. Francis Dike said “we apologise to Imo people and Nigerians for what happened last Saturday. As illustrious and dignified as we are, we were last Saturday shocked to see Orlu being projected on national television as an enclave of  impunity and lawlessness. And that is not what we are.  “What happened at the Imo West senatorial district collation centre will never be allowed to happen again. We, however, commend the Returning Officer, Professor Innocent Ibeawuchi for being firm and walking the path of honour and integrity. Imo is proud of such a son. “I urge all of our people in spite of what may have transpired in the last election, to go out and vote on the 9th of March. After voting, stay there and protect your vote. If they fight you, fight them back.  We have a right to fight for the future of our people.” Earlier, Dike announced the resolve of the Orlu Elders’ Council to fully support the candidacy of Chief Emeka Ihedioha in the March 9, governorship polls, adding that in the spirit of equity and fairness, the council had also resolved that no Orlu man will run or get the support of the council to run for the governorship of the state.
