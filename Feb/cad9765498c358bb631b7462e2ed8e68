 Although men’s fashion has evolved in recent times, men ordinarily don’t like flashy colours and red falls into that bracket for most guys. Since its Valentine’s Day this week, it wouldn’t be out of place for you to appear for that special date rocking the colour of love as one of your ensembles.  It could be your cap, shoes, blazers or even your accessories such as wrist bands. You don’t have to appear in a head to toe red outfit, but a touch of red will add glamour and excitement to your day. What’s important is that you are in tune with the mood of the day as you go ahead to paint the town red with that special lady in your life.
