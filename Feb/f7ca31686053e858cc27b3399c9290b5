 Despite the scarcity of foreign exchange, a total of 968,000 tons of crude palm oil valued at N206.3 billion ($573 million) was imported in the last three years by Nigeria. The commodity is among the products banned by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) from sourcing foreign exchange at the interbank market. Findings, however, revealed that produce is being imported from Thailand and Malaysia to meet industrial and domestic demand, as annual consumption rose to 2.7 million tons. Global price of the product has been raised from $567 per ton last October, to $592 per ton as at last January due to high demand by industries. Already, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has said that palm oil market would expand to an estimated $88 billion by 2022 to meet demand. Last year, the country imported 350,000 tons, an increase of 9.38 from the 320,000 imported in 2017 despite the 35 per cent duty paid by manufacturing firms and other importers to bring the product to the country. According to data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Nigeria, which is the fourth largest producer of palm oil in the world accounting for 3 per cent of global production, took delivery of 298,000 tons in 2016 to meet the country’s short fall. Nigeria’s palm oil produce had witnessed a downturn contributing on 1.4 per cent to global market share as at 2018. It was gathered that the increase in destruction of oil palm plantations in the country has added to the short fall. According to the Managing Director of JEKON Integrated Farms Nigeria Limited, Mr. Godswealth Henry, Cameroon and Ghana had already saturated Nigerian market with low quality palm oil. He explained that Nigerian oil was of high quality and considered very expensive in the market. Henry noted that while Cameroon and Ghana were developing thousands of hectares of new oil palm plantations, Nigeria was busy destroying their palm oil trees. “Nigeria palm oil quality is of high reddish pigmentation unlike the ones from Cameroon and Ghana, which have low reddish pigmentation,” he said. This high reddish pigmentation from wide palm is the real palm oil and is what makes our palm oil superior.” Henry said that the volume of palm oil produced in Nigeria was very low because of scarcity of palm fruits. It was gathered that between 2017 and 2018 Nigeria’s annual consumption of palm oil has reached 2.7 million tons. According to the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA)’s shipping position, 111,398 tons of the produce was imported at Lagos and Tincan ports last year. The Lagos Port Complex took delivery of 5,700 MV Tina Theresa in July alone, while MV Champion Cornelia offloaded 4,999 tons at JosepDam in Tincan Island Port. Also in March, 2018, 55, 699 tons were offloaded from Susan Victory and 45,000 tons from Desert Spring. It was learnt that the country requires 2.7million tons to meet its consumption. However, New Telegraph gathered that local production had remained static at 970,000 tons since 2015. Meanwhile, in February last year, the Senate called on the Federal Government to ban the importation of palm oil into the country in order to protect local production.
