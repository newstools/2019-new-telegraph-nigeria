Police in Niger State yesterday arrested a 35-year-old man, Clement Nwachukwu, was on Sunday arrested for allegedly defiling two underage girls after luring them with N50 each. It was learnt that the suspect lured the girls (names withheld), who are seven and eight years old respectively, with N50 each to an uncompleted building where he had sex with them. Nwachukwu of Kwamba area, Suleja, was nabbed by policemen attached to ‘A’ Division in Suleja Local Government Area who acted on information they received. Parents of the victims, both from Kwamba area in Suleja, had earlier reported the matter to the police before the suspect was trailed and arrested. Nwachukwu who is a father of three, is allegedly a serial rapist in Kwamba area before he met his waterloo. Upon questioning, the suspect told our correspondent he could not say why he was defiling minors. He said: “Whenever I see underage girls in my area, I get aroused and lose control of myself. “I don’t know what has come over me, that each time I see little girls in my area; I will be forced by what I don’t know to have sex with them, not minding that I am a father of three. That is too bad. “I have been in this act for more than four years and it looks as if somebody has placed a curse on me. Nothing works for me, and sometimes I feel I have sinned against my destiny. It is unfortunate.” When asked how he felt about his act, he said “after defiling these innocent minors, I asked myself what if my wife catches me or hears about my evil deeds. I feel very bad about my act. I am finished and I know my wife will never forgive me. Right now, I am finished.” Confirming the incident, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Muhammad Abubakar, said the suspect had confessed to the crime and admitted that he lured the two minors to an uncompleted building with N50 at different times.
