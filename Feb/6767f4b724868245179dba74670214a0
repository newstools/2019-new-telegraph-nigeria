The Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) recently achieved a milestone of 365 days ‘Lost Time Injury’, translating to 1.6 million safe man-hours based on its mission to attain the vision zero incident by 2020.
The Chief Technical Officer, IBEDC, Mr. Ade Ayileka, said this in a statement made available to New Telegraph in Lagos.
“This safety achievement is a big milestone in the power sector considering the level of risks involved in the day-to-day activities and the extent of free access to electrical installations,” he said.
“The power sector by nature is fraught with high-level hazard and occupational risk. To achieve a year with no lost time Injury is definitely a milestone to recognise.”
The utility company, Ayileka stated, was determined to put safety at the forefront of all its operations, as its mission was to attain the vision zero incident by 2020.
According to him, the major milestone was achieved due mainly to the emphasis placed on safety within IBEDC, which has formed part of its core strategic business goals consistently for over three years.
Ayileka said this also included extensive customer education, sensitisation on safety and huge investment on safety gear and equipment for staff.
“To ensure we continue to keep safety as a culture as we work toward the International Standard Certification, which specifies requirements for an Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) Management System, Ibadan Disco has obtained the services of an accredited environmental consultancy firm,” he said.
AMPAK Nigeria Limited was engaged for a health, safety and environment improvement programme, and according to Ayileka, the firm would help IBEDC consolidate its existing safety structure and recommend new measures to attain the International Safety Standard Certification- ISO 45001-2018.
