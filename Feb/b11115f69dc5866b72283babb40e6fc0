The leadership of Ohanaeze Youth Council (OYC) Worldwide, yesterday raised the alarm over plot to subvert the will of the people of the South-East during Saturday’s Presidential and the National Assembly elections.
OYC President-General, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro made the allegation in a statement in Abakaliki, Ebonyi state capital. He said that Ohanaeze Youth through credible intelligence report had gathered that a political party working with some leaders in the South-East had mapped out plans to scuttle the presidential elections in the South-East. He said: “OYC has discovered a dangerous trend going on now in the South-East ahead of the rescheduled Presidential Election on Saturday 23rd February 2019. “From intelligent report the organizers of a meeting scheduled to hold in Enugu on Thursday 21st February between some Igbo Organizations have been induced by agents of some political parties to scuttle the voting will of the people of the South-East. “Ohanaeze Youths is recommending to relevant authorities that anyone caught engaging in vote buying especially in the Southeast should face the same penalty as anyone caught in snatching of ballot boxes. “The heavy dispatching of funds going on now in South-East is terrible and those Igbo leaders behind it should not be allowed to sell our political future to the highest bidder.”  “Igbo Youths know exactly where they will cast their votes, especially in consultation with the Southeast Governors and political leaders. We will surely deliver our votes in one direction towards ensuring that we will return Ndigbo to the mainstream. “Perpetrators of vote buying in the Southeast are banking on expected voters’ apathy likely going to happen in the Southeast because those who returned home last weekend for the rescheduled election may have returned to their bases.”
