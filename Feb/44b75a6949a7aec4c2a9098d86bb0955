Determined to regain public confidence for the Police, the Acting Inspector General (IG), Mr. Mohammed Adamu, has set the machinery in motion to change the standard of policing in the country. This was as Adamu said the era of unmerited promotion in the Police was gone for good. The IGP made the declaration yesterday in Abuja, at the decoration ceremony for newly promoted Deputy Inspectors General (DIGs) of Police. He charged officers and personnel to rededicate themselves to their duties, even as he harped on professionalism, dedication to duty, and hard work. His words: “Let me clearly emphasise that policing standards and practices have to change in Nigeria if only we want to restore citizens’ trust and attain our mandate in the most effective manner. “We, therefore, need to re-strategise and take the Police back to the community. We have to also evolve new thoughts and embrace new orientation as a police organisation, to work with the citizens, neighbourhood, and other strategic security actors as a pathway towards addressing communal crimes.” While recognising the fact that the policing space was a rather complex one, the IGP, nonetheless, said promotion would be based on merit. “It is also a clear statement that under my leadership, merit shall be the overriding standard that will guide promotion,” he said.
