Ex-international, Mutiu Adepoju, has called on the Flying Eagles coach, Paul Aigbogun, to work on the goal-scoring problem noticed in his team ahead of their campaign at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Poland later in the year. The team failed to get to the final of the U-20 AFCON after losing their semifinal game to Mali on penalties, although they had already picked the ticket to the U-20 World Cup by virtue of their getting to the semifinal of the African tourney. To get to the last four, the team scored paltry three goals in three matches while scoring another one in the semifinal game against Mali before losing the game 4-3 on penalties after the regulation time ended 1-1 with the Nigerian side coming from a goal down to force an extra time in the game. Adepoju, a member of the 1989 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Saudi Arabia, said there was no way a team would win a championship without scoring goals. The LaLiga Ambassador to Nigeria said the coach should search everywhere for the best players to fill into the position. “We have to congratulate them for qualifying for the World Cup although it was so unfortunate that they failed to get to the final of the competition,” Adepoju said. “I hope the third place match will be better than what we have seen so far in the competition, I think they should learn from what has happened to them. I still believe in the prowess of the technical crew, but the players need to sit up. “For me, if they are not scoring goals, then Aigbogun should find a way of working on that position ahead of the World Cup because without goals, you can’t win matches. “They have to be able to convert their chances especially when they get to the World Cup. If the coach feels he can only get the players to solve that goal scoring problem from outside the country, so be it and if he can get the players from the home front, he should just do something about that problem.”
