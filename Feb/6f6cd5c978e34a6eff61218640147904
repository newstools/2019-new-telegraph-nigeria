A teenager, Babatunde Awosika, on Monday appeared before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court over alleged intent to steal with a                                                toy gun. The police also charged 18-year-old Awosika with being in possession of someone’s international passport. The teenager, whose address was not provided, was charged before Magistrate Jadesola Adeyemi-Ajayi, but he pleaded not guilty. The Prosecutor, Insp. Raji Akeem, said that the teenager was caught with a toy gun by a police patrol team which was on a stop-and-search operation on Jan.18, at Olowu Junction, Ikeja. “The police found a toy gun and an international passport belonging to one Ruben Godwin in the defendant’s bag. “When he was asked what he was doing with a toy gun and someone’s passport, he could not give a satisfactory answer,” the prosecutor said.
