 Ahead of Nigeria’s U-23 AFCON doubleheader qualifiers against Libya, Nigeria’s U-23 team head coach, Imama Amapakabo has disclosed that foreign-based professionals will join up them as they remain the B team of the main Super Eagles.
The Super Eagles’ assistant coach further played down suggestions that the late camping ahead of the qualifiers could affect the country’s chances of making it to the main tournament in Egypt later in the year.
“We have started which is most important. We have to try as much as possible to give the country the very best of representation when we play between the 20th and 26th and hopefully scale the hurdle.
“This is like the B team of the Super Eagles. I think it is an opportunity to see a whole lot of players that are knocking on the door and want to make it into the main national team; so, hopefully, before then we will have few foreign players in the squad,” Imama told AOIFootball.com.
12 players are currently in the team’s camp in Abuja as the coaches await the arrival of others after Thursday’s round of league matches as they begin full preparation ahead of next month’s clash.
The Dream Team will travel to Tunisia to face Libya on the weekend 20-21 of March before hosting the return leg four days later in Nigeria. The winner of the tie will progress to the final round qualifiers in June.
