Rivers Hoopers have strengthened their roster by recruiting Kano Pillars forward, Abdul Yahaya, ahead of their Group A games at the FIBA Africa Basketball League next month in Morocco. Yahaya, who was a member of the D’Tigers silver-winning squad in 2017, scored a total of 39 points in five games at the 2017 FIBA 3X3 Africa Cup in Togo and also represented Nigeria at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia. He led Mark Mentors to the 2015 DSTV Basketball league title and emerged as the most valuable player of the competition and won the title with Pillars the following year. Yahaya said he is in Port Harcourt to win and also do well with the club: “My target is to qualify from the group stage of the FIBA ABL and go far in the competition. We need to work hard and prepare because it’s an international competition not local.” At the 2017 FIBA Africa Zone 3 qualifiers in Lagos, Yayaha was named most valuable player, highest rebounder and highest scorer as Kano Pillars claimed the title in Lagos. He went on to play for Pillars at the 2017 FIBA Africa Champions Cup in Tunisia. Despite losing to AS Sale in their opening game 112-83 points, Yahaha was top performer for Pillars as he scored 22 points, 8 rebounds and 2 steals.
