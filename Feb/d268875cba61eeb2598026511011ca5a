The Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC) will on Feb.14 arraign three men, Dikko Inde, Garba Makarfi and Umar Hussaini, at the Federal High Court, Abuja, over alleged N1.1 billion fraud. The three men are to stand trial on a ten-count charge, including on conspiracy, obtaining money under false pretence, abuse of office and money laundering. The ICPC Prosecutor, Mr Adenekan Shogunle, told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Tuesday that the charge with number FHC /ABJ/21/2019 and proof of evidence was filed in court on Jan. 21. According to the charge sheet, the three men, all adults, on April 6, 2010, conspired among themselves with intent to defraud one Mr Yemi Obadeji, Managing Director of Cambial Ltd. Obadedi was asked by these men to pay the sum of N1,100,952,380.96 into the account of Capital Law Office, a private law firm owned by Hussaini. The charge also stated that the said sum was paid under the pretext that it was required as a refundable “completion security deposit’’ in respect of the contract. NAN gathered that the supposed contract was in connection with the purported purchase of 120 duplexes as residential accommodation for officers of the Nigeria Customs Service. The prosecutor also disclosed that in the verifying affidavit, as filed in the court, the defendants were investigated for alleged violation of the ICPC Act, 2000 and Money Laundering Prohibition Act, 2011.
