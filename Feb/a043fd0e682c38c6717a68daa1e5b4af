 Nigeria’s U-23 team coach, Imama Amapakabo, has submitted the list of players to be invited to camp ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics qualifier against Libya next month.
The names of the invited players mostly from the Nigeria Professional Football League will be released by the Nigeria Football Federation next week for camping, our correspondent learnt.
The team will be in action next month and the coach has already contacted clubs of the players who were invited following his elevation to the role of head coach in the absence of the suspended Salisu Yusuf.
Our correspondent learnt from sources at the NFF’s secretariat that the names of some foreign based players also featured on the list.
Imama’s first assignment will be to guide the team to qualification for the Africa U-23 Cup of Nations which will see them play Libya next month in the second round of qualifiers for the tournament which will be held in Egypt.
The tournament will serve as qualifiers for the Olympic Games in Tokyo next year with defending champions Nigeria the favourite to pick one of the three tickets reserved for Africa.
