A 13-year-old primary six pupil has given birth to a baby at the Central Hospital Benin, the Edo state capital. The girl who hails from Cross River state was impregnated by her father. New Telegraph investigation showed that the girl put to bed on Saturday last week at the hospital. She was still in primary school when her father identified as Mr. Friday Moses impregnated her. Findings revealed that the teenager has since then been in protective custody of the Edo State government. It was further learnt that she is the eldest daughter of her 42 years old father. Mr. Moses, a commercial motorcyclist, had been having sex with his own daughter when she was seven years old shortly after the death of her mother. A Family Court sitting in the state had in October last year sentenced the man to 14 years imprisonment with hard labour without an option of fine for the abominable act. She had told newsmen in Benin, the state capital that she would like to continue with her education in order to fulfill her dream ambition of becoming a medical doctor, pointing out that as at the time her father put her in a family way, she was yet to write her First School Leaving Certificate examination. The teenager, therefore, appealed to good spirited individuals and organizations to come to her help towards supporting her education. The Medical Director of the hospital, Dr. Philip Ugbodaga, said yesterday that he has directed the management to cancel the medical bills of the teenage mother. Dr. Ugbodaga said the hospital was in collaboration with the Ministry if Women Affairs and Social Development to take proper care of the teenage mother and her baby. He stated that subsequent assistance for the victim would be based on situation that arose. Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Development, Ms Magdalene Ohenhen, could not be reached yesterday for comments on the matter.
