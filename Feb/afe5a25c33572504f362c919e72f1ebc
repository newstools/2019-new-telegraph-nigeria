The Jigawa Deputy Governor, Alhaji Ibrahim Hassan, on Saturday cast his vote at Yankoli polling unit in Hadejia Local Government Area of Jigawa, describing the conduct of the election by the Independent National Election (INEC) as “fantastic.” Speaking with newsmen after casting his vote, Hassan observed that the election started on schedule in Hadejia and that the turn-out was “incredible.” “I was among those that criticised INEC for postponing the elections last week, but seeing what is happening today, the postponement is a blessing in the disguise. “I have never been in an election that the queues are as long as they are; I predict a turnout of 80 percent for this election here,” he said. On the simultaneous accreditation and voting, the deputy governor, who is also vying for Jigawa Northeast Senatorial seat under the umbrella of APC, said the strategy would “avert the wastage of 25 percent of votes accredited in this area”. Also commenting on the elections, Senator Ubali Shitu, the PDP senatorial candidate for the zone, also said the exercise was commendable.
