The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Enugu State chapter has commended the Independent National Electoral Commissioned (INEC) and security personnel for the success of the Presidential and National Assembly polls held in the state on Saturday. In a release signed by the State Chairman of PDP, Chief Augustine Nnamani and made available to journalists in Enugu yesterday, the party described the poll as free, fair, credible and peaceful. The party also thanked the people of the state, for coming out en masse to exercise their franchise. The statement reads: “The Enugu State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) commends the Independent National Election Commission (INEC) and security agencies for the free, fair, credible, and peaceful conduct of the February 23, 2019 Presidential/ National Assembly elections. “The State Chapter notes with commendation the neutral and professional conduct of INEC officials, security agencies, various monitoring teams and observers in the state. “We particularly commend them for disappointing certain characters, who rather than embark on robust campaigns like the PDP, spent their precious time plotting and bragging about how they would misapply critical institutions of democracy to intimidate voters and manipulate the elections. “Meanwhile, as we await the formal declaration of results/winners by the INEC, we commend the good people of Enugu State for their large turnouts and peaceful conducts during the elections despite clear provocations from certain quarters. This goes further to show that Enugu State is indeed a peaceful state truly secure in the hands of God.”
