 Justice Oluremi Oguntoyibo of a Federal High Court in Lagos has ordered the remand of four men arraigned by the Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) for producing adulterated engine oil.
The judge ordered that Johnson Uche, Olaide Shittu, Kingsley Meteke and Abdulquadri Olayinka be remanded in prison pending their arraignment on March 1, 2019.  The order was sequel to a request by the prosecution’s lawyer, Adeleke Olofindare, asking that the defendants be kept in prison, pending when they will have legal representation.
In a four-count charge, SON said the defendants and others at large had on January 2, 2019 at 2, Esugbayi Street, NPA Quarters, Marine Bridge, Apapa, produced adulterated engine oil for public consumption.
They allegedly claimed that the products were genuine engine oil and sold them to unsuspecting motorists. The prosecution said the engine oil did not comply with mandatory industrial standards, an offence that violated Section 26 of the SON’s Act 2015.
In the second count, the prosecution said the defendants, on the same day and place, “did indulge in dealing in and offering for sale adulterated/substandard engine oil”.
SON said they claimed that the substandard product was genuine, contrary to Section 1 (18) (ii) of the Miscellaneous Offences Act of 2004.
