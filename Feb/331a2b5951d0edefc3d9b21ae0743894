Stakeholders in the just concluded Presidential and the National Assembly elections in Ekiti have commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the security agencies for the peaceful conduct of Saturday polls in the state. They described the elections across the state as peaceful, free, fair and credible, saying that the one-week earlier postponement had been justified. Traditional ruler of Ire-Ekiti in Oye Local Government Area of Ekiti, Oba Victor Bobade, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in his palace at Ire-Ekiti, that the exercise went smoothly in his domain with everything organised in peaceful manner. Oba Bobade said that Nigerians should appreciate INEC for making adequate arrangements for the exercise, “which however justifies the one week postponement by the electoral body.” He went on: “Although people were not sure that the election will hold, expecting another postponement, but INEC made good his promises that they were ready for the elections to conduct a free, fair and credible poll. “After I voted, I addressed the voters to ensure that they maintain peace during and after the conduct of the polls. “I thereafter moved round to monitor the exercise in my domain, where I stop to address the voters, the impressive turn out of voters was an indication that the exercise had yielded fruitful results. “Everybody was expecting a kind of apathy from the voters due to the earlier postponement by INEC and we had to intensify our sensitisation based on this.
