There are indications that the Joint Admissions a and Matriculation Board (JAMB), may shift the dates for the conduct of the 2019 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examinations (UTME), due to the rescheduled general elections. The management of the board had on Wednesday held a meeting to decide if the examinations scheduled to hold March 16th to 23rd should be shifted. But as of Wednesday evening, the board was yet to reach a decision whether or not to go on with its original timetable. Speaking to our correspondent, the Head of Information JAMB, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, noted that “there is a possibility the exams will be shifted but the board has not arrived at a position.” Meanwhile, the 2019 mock examination which was scheduled to hold Saturday, 23rd February, would no longer hold as the Presidential elections have been rescheduled by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to hold across the country on the same date. Commenting on the cancelled JAMB mock examinations,  Fabian said the board was yet to come up with a new date for candidates to undergo the mock examination which was aimed to further prepare them for the main exams.
