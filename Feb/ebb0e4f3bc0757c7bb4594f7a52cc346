A three-storey building collapsed on Monday night at East Street by Park Road, Aba, Abia State. Although no life was lost, the building, which was under construction, collapsed leaving many persons around it seriously injured. One person was said to have lost one of his legs. The building collapsed from the third to the first floors, leaving only the ground floor. The incident occurred during the rain about 11p.m. on Monday. Sources in the area claimed the building might have been poorly constructed, using inferior materials. It was also learnt that those injured in the collapsed building were security guards working for some traders using ground floor as warehouse and others who use it as temporary home. A resident of the area, who gave his name simply as Mr. Kenechukwu, said he witnessed the collapse. Kenechukwu said that the injured were rushed to the hospital. He said: “It happened about 11p.m. I was in my house nearby when we heard the noise. Initially, I thought it was the usual thing of a vehicle losing its brake and hitting a fence which we have become accustomed to here because the road is sloppy around this area. As you can see, it is not far from the Aba River.
“I later realised it was beyond that when I came out and started hearing cries of the injured. “We all rushed here, rescued the ones who were closer, but one was trapped as one of his legs was held back by the collapsed pillars of the building. “
