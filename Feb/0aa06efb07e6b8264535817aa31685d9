The Chairman, Actors’ Guild of Nigeria (AGN), Lagos Chapter, Don Pedro Obaseki, has appealed to his members to vote for actors and actresses contesting for political positions in the Feb.16 and March 2 general elections.  Pedro, in an interview in Lagos, commended members of the association who were vying for political offices in this year’s elections.  He also said that entertainers holding political offices were doing well by serving the people.  According to him, Uchenna Anyamele is the Lagos State governorship candidate on the platform of the United Democratic Party (UDP). He added that Desmond Elliot would be contesting for the Lagos State House of Assembly from Surulere on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). He described them as worthy candidates.  “This invariably shows that entertainers can add value to the society and can also make a difference in governance. I commend my colleagues who have taken this bold step to contest for political positions; and I urge our members to come out en masse and vote for them.
“When we go out to vote, we should vote in unison; and our first choice of whom to vote should be AGN members,” he said.  Pedro also advised youths to be mindful of their association during the elections, and guard against being used by politicians to disrupt the electoral process.  “Over the years, youths have been used by politicians as thugs to disrupt electoral processes and cause confusion in the society. Youths should endeavour to comport themselves, get their permanent voter cards (PVCs) and vote for the candidates of their choices,” the actors’ guild official said.
