The Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday rejected in its entirety the list of ad-hoc staff of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the conduct of the February 16, presidential and National Assembly elections in the state. This was as the party warned that “the forthcoming election should not only be free, fair and transparent, it must be seen to be free from all electoral hitches.” Publicity Secretary of the party in the state, Chris Nehikhare said the directive was clear and explicit, stressing that “university vice-chancellors were asked to provide a list of its members of staff who would be deployed as ad-hoc staff.” He noted: “In Edo State, INEC has been handed a list of APC card-carrying members and operatives as University of Benin staff by the vice-chancellor. The list we are informed was written at the Government House in Benin, the state capital, and handed over to the Vice- Chancellor for transmission to INEC.“This purported INEC ad-hoc staff list must be completely discarded as it is a recipe for chaos as it poses a great danger to our nascent democracy. We reject it and condemn the politicisation of the ‘employment’ of APC members as ad-hoc staff to manage the election process.” “We call on the vice-chancellor of the University of Benin not to allow himself to be used. He must do the right thing by withdrawing the scandalous list he was prevailed upon to submit, and hand over one made up of genuine staff of the university.”
