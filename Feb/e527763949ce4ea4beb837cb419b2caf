Human rights group, Civil Rights Realisation and Advancement Network (CRRAN), has petitioned the Inspector General of Police (IGP) over the alleged cold-blooded shooting and murder of a Nigerian by personnel of the Nigerian Customs, along Lagos -Sagamu Express Road. In a petition signed by the Olu Omotayo, Esq, the President of CRRAN); the group said that Civil Rights Realisation and Advancement Network (CRRAN); the group said that since an offence of murder has been committed and by virtue of the laws of the land, it was only the police that has the power to investigate and bring the culprits to book. “The video which is all over the social media is self-explanatory. Though the Nigeria Customs authority has reacted but it is incumbent on the Police authority to intervene and investigate this matter. “It is only the intervention and proper investigation of this matter by the Nigeria Police that would bring back confidence to Nigerians and assure them of their safety while plying our roads particularly the Lagos -Benin Expressway which has on many occasions been made unsafe due to the activities of paramilitary agencies like the customs and officials of Road safety Commission. “It is the duty of the Nigeria Police to protect Nigeria citizens and all road users. “The Nigeria Customs Service does not have the power to investigate cases of murder as happened in the present case,” the group stressed. CRRAN sad that it is in the interest of justice and the country as whole that the IGP orders a thorough investigation into the case and ensure that justice was done as the circumstance of the case demands.
