…as Udi charges team to go for victory   Flying Eagles coach, Paul Aigbogun, has set his sight on securing World Cup qualification when the team plays its final group game of the on-going CAF U-20 Africa Cup of Nations against hosts Niger in Niamey today.
Aigbogun assured Nigerians that Flying Eagles would clinch the victory that would take them to the World Cup in Poland.
Speaking with journalists in Niamey, Aigbogun reiterated his primary target which was the World Cup ticket.
The Nigeria’s U-20 side currently top Group A of the AFCON with four points after a win and a draw against Burundi and South Africa respectively.
A win against the host Niger will see the team securing one of the World Cup tickets ahead of the other teams in the group.
“We are going for a win because anything short of that might be detrimental to our ambition,” the former Enyimba coach said.
“We are not going back on our initial plans of qualifying for the World Cup in Poland later in the year and also winning the trophy.”
Meanwhile, Ex-international, Duke Udi, has urged the team to go for total victory against Niger in their last group game.
Speaking with our correspondent on the telephone, Udi said the team must not think of playing for a draw as that might put them under unnecessary pressure.
Udi said: “The Flying Eagles have been playing very well; they just have to remain focussed and play the way they have been playing.
“What they need is luck and they should take their chances, when they do that, they will come out victorious.
“I don’t believe in a draw or winning as player or a coach, what you will be expecting is a win and not a draw.
“When you have it in mind to go for a win; at the end of the day you may end up drawing the tie, but if you go for a draw you might be on the losing end.
“What we should be thinking of is how to win the game and I know we are capable of beating Niger; we are not underrating them but I know we have the players that can do it.”
