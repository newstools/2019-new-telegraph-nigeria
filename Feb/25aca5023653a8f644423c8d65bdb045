The coalition of political parties in Zamfara State yesterday called for the cancellation of the National Assembly election results and the immediate removal of Independent National Electoral Commission Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the state, Hajiya Asma’u Maikudi.  Addressing a press conference in Gusau, the coalition led by APGA governorship candidate in the state, Dr. Sani Abdullahi Shinkafi, said the election conducted last Saturday in the state, particularly the National Assembly elections, was marred by irregularities.  According to him, the coalition made up of PDP, APGA, NRM, YPP, ADC, ACCORD, NUP and NNPP in the state, challenged the election in the state, stressing that “the REC, Asma’u Maikudi, deliberately connived with officials of the state APC and the security agents to manipulate elections in the state.”
