Ekiti State government has intervened in the crisis rocking Odo-Ora in Ido-Osi Local Government Area where the subjects locked their monarch out of the palace. T he Deputy Governor, Otunba Bisi Egbeyemi, during a peace meeting held in his office, condemned the violence which broke out in the community. The Special Assistant (Media) to the deputy governor, Odunayo Ogunmola, said Egbeyemi warned that the full weight of the law would be visited on individuals fomenting trouble in Odo-Ora. The Obalemo of Odo- Ora, Oba Samuel Akinola Adeyemo, told the deputy governor that he had been locked out of the palace by suspected hoodlums allegedly mobilised by some interest groups in the community. The monarch, who forwarded a ‘Save My Soul’ message to government on the crisis, also revealed that palm fronds were tied to the gate of the palace to prevent him from occupying the building. The kingmakers and other community leaders alleged that the procedure that produced the monarch was faulty and that he was not formally installed. Egbeyemi said that government had to summon the peace meeting following intelligence report from security agencies on possible outbreak of violence over the kingship crisis. The deputy governor warned stakeholders in Odo-Ora to maintain peace, stressing that government won’t depose any monarch in the state. He advised the aggrieved Odo-Ora indigenes over the emergence of Oba Adeyemo as the Obalemo to seek redress in court. Egbeyemi added that government would not fold its arms and allow the situation to degenerate into anarchy. One of the community leaders, Prof. Olawumi Ajaja, said Odo-Ora indigenes had nothing against the person of the monarch but against the process that produced him. Ajaja, former Rector of the Federal Polytechnic, Ado-Ekiti, said the subjects still saw the monarch as an Oba-elect, alleging that traditional rites were yet to be performed.
