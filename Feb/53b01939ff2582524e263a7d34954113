One person was abducted at Otu-Okpu in Ika North East Local Government Area of Delta State during the electoral violence between supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The supporters of the ruling PDP in the state allegedly unleash terror on their counterparts in APC for trespassing into their domain to woo voters. The fisticuff dovetailed into the abduction of a youth leader and left several other canvassers of the opposition party in severe injuries. The APC candidate for Ika Federal Constituency, Hon. Sabastine Okoh, in Umunede yesterday alleged that a PDP leader in the area, who is a serving appointee under Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, masterminded the crisis. Okoh said besides the abducted APC supporter, there was massive rigging in Emuhun and Igbodo communities by PDP agents. He said: “A youth among us (APC) is still missing and over 10 other persons were wounded. He was kidnapped and we don’t know his whereabouts since they were attacked and held hostage in Otu-Okpu. Two journalists were not spared and several other persons were attacked.” While Okoh said he had reported the assassinated attempt on his life and the case of the missing person to the Police Area Commander for immediate action. The Special Assistant to Okowa on Print Media, Prince Victor Efeizomor, said it is crystal clear that Ika North East was for Okowa, being the son of the soil. He said: “The entire Ika nation and its sister council areas in Delta North Senatorial District are for the Governor. The Emuhun in question is PDP. There was no access road to the town for decades. It was Governor Okowa that opened up the town with network of roads. Why would they not vote him?” Efeizomor described the allegation of electoral violence and abduction as baseless and unfounded, and urged its proponents to seek relief elsewhere.
