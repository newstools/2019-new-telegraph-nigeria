Stakeholders have blamed the Federal Government for the deficit in maritime transport infrastructure in the country. They explained at a summit organised by Nigerian Economic Growth Summit Group (NEGSG) held in Apapa, Lagos, that the Federal Ministry of Transport which is responsible for the development and establishment of a national policy direction for the nation’s entire transportation infrastructure had not done something tangible to improve maritime industry. In a paper delivered by the Chairman of the group, Prof. Alex Okwuashi, the rector of Certified institute of Shipping of Nigerian (CISN) in Apapa, the decision made to develop the “Masterplan for an Integrated Transportation Infrastructure since 2001 to address various imbalances affecting the entire transportation sector of the nation has not worked out due poor budget for the industry. Okwuashi explained that Nigeria was a notable maritime economy whose potentialities were yet to be fully harnessed. He noted that the sub sector was ranked second to oil in terms of revenue earnings. Okwuashi, who was represented CISN’s Registrar, Gabriel Eto, said the imbalances between the resources required for maintaining and renewing the existing maritime infrastructure and the resources available to meet the requirements were overwhelming. According to him, the vital role of maritime transport infrastructure in enhancing operations in the sector cannot be over emphasized, saying that the efficient functioning, productivity and value addition of maritime logistics all depend on the availability of suitable maritime transport infrastructure.
