Gunmen have abducted three people at Idominasi on Ilesa-Osogbo Road, Osun State. This came three days after two workers at the Bowen University, Iwo, were abducted on Iwo-Osogbo Road.
The latest abduction was carried out on Tuesday. The kidnappers were said to have shot sporadically into the air before they abducted the victims whose identities were not known at press time. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mrs. Folashade Odoro, confirmed the report.
She said two females and a male were kidnapped. Odoro said the police had swung into action to arrest the abductors.
