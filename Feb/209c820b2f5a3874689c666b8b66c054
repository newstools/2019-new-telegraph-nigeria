 The National Orientation Agency (NOA) and the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) have called on all stakeholders within the nation’s capital to eschew violence and avoid all acts that could mar the forthcoming elections.
The call came during a sensitization campaign organized to create awareness among civil servants on the need to promote best practices that would guarantee the success of the elections in the territory.
It followed the growing tension among both the politicians and the electorate, with increasing concerns over safety of lives, before, during and after the elections. Director General of NOA in the FCT, David Dogo, said the sensitization campaign became necessary to help voters understand the technical issues that were involved in elections.
Dogo urged participants to take the orientation to their neighbourhood and help. He noted that civil servants were in the position to disseminate the message of hitch free election to the electorate, who are less electorally educated.
The FCT minister, represented by Hajia Safiya Umar, noted that civil servants play vital roles in promoting a violence free election.
Umar, who is also the acting secretary, Social Development Secretariat, SDS, said if the civil servants failed to sensitize the residents on the significances of peaceful election, right persons and steps would not be put in place.
“We as civil servants should sit up and do the needful, so that there will be strengthen system that could benefit all and stand the test of time.”
