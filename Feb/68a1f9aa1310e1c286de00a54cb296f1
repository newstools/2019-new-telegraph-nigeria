For his towering accomplishments in the field of engineering as well as in other spheres of life, Ibadan based former governorship aspirant, Femi Babalola, who doubles as the owner of popular event center in Ibadan, Jogor Centre, is one man many admire his achievements and wish they were in his shoes. However, it is not the same case now as Babalola is going through challenges as far as his political career is concerned. The brilliant and articulate dude, those who should know reveal is in serious dilemma as his political interest is conflicting with his personal ones. It was learnt the source of his dilemma is to choose between governorship candidates of Peoples Democratic Party, PDP and that of All Progressive Congress, APC, Engineer Seyi Makinde and Bayo Adelabu. Expectedly, as a PDP faithful, Babalola is meant to throw his weight behind his party’s candidate, Makinde, on the other hand however, APC’s candidate, Adelabu and Babalola are said to be so close and have shared so much together that no political differences is expected to come between them. Sources reveal it is such delicate situation that Femi has only been banking on God to deal with the situation while he prays the election is here already so his dilemma can be over.
