Kano State Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, yesterday said his predecessor in office, Rabiu Musa Kwankwasoleft the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) hurriedly in search of the presidency that was not there, ‘losing out in the scheme of politics.’ Ganduje, who was speaking while receiving BuhariContact and Mobilisation Committee of his Presidential Campaign Council at the Government House, said Kwankwaso had forgotten that the presidency he was looking for was occupied and there was no vacancy. He said: “Kwankwaso looked for an ambition that does not exist in APC he left the party after realising that; but still lost out in the PDP, making him almost losing out in the scheme of things generally.” The governor emphasised that; “Kano politics is Buhari and Buhari is Kano politics, today Kano people and APC stand firm behind President Muhammadu Buhari and there is nothing anybody can do about that.”
He said Kano APC was conflict-free, because their primaries were done without problems, “and today we have 30 out of 40 House of Assembly members contesting without any problem and out of three senators, two are going back without any problem.”
