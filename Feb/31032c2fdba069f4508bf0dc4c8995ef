Fernebahce of Turkey winger, Victor Moses, has played down his side’s 1-1 draw at home against visiting Konyaspor. Although Moses admitted it was disappointing to see his side fail to win in his very first starting role in the Turkish Super Lig, has consoled himself with the fact that the draw took them one step up the table. Moses admitted he was also hurt that his effort to score a goal did not go in, which could have given The Yellow Canaries maximum points at home. The ex-Super Eagles star said he was now looking forward to the next game. Moses, who is on loan from Chelsea of England, said he was happy to start the match at Sukru Saracoglu Spor Kompleksi, Istanbul on Saturday, having previously got off the bench against Yeni Malatyaspor, Göztepe and Kayserispor in his first three matches since his arrival in January.
