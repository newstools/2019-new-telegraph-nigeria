The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) late Friday said it would remove all those who emerged from the late Mathew Achigbe factions from its list following what it said was a court order to recognize the Etim John faction of the All Progressives Congress in Cross River State. The Resident Electoral Commissioner, Dr. Frankland Briyai who addressed Journalists on the sudden changes said he received instruction from INEC headquarters in Abuja to make the changes. “I have an instruction from Abuja to make public to all Cross Riverians. I want to read out now.  It is dated 22nd February 22, 2019 and is to the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Cross River State titled ‘Forwarding of commission’s decision pursuant to order of court.” Briyai, who did not entertain any question immediately after reading the memo sent to him, said all those whose names were submitted by the late Mathew Achigbe’s faction, which include the Senator representing the central senatorial district, Senator John Owan-Enoh who is running as APC’s governorship candidate and Senator Ndoma-Egba, who is running for the central senatorial seat, among others. Others affected by the INEC decision include all members of the House of Representatives and House of Assemblies whose names were submitted by the late Achigbe’s faction. However, Briyai said the logo of the APC will remain, saying that the Etim John faction would be requested to submit names of candidates from its faction.
