Akinwunmi Ambode, the Lagos State Governor, has presented a budget of N852.13bn to the Lagos State House of Assembly. The budget is lower than that of last year, which was N1.046trn. Explaining the shortfall in the 2019 budget, Ambode said the budget performance of 2018 was put into consideration before preparing the 2019 budget. “The overall 2018 budget stood at 60 per cent and that was put into consideration in preparing the 2019 budget. “The 2019 budget is all-encompassing and it will cater for all Lagosians,” Ambode said.
