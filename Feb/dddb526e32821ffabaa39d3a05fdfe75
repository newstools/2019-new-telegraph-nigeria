Super Eagles captain Mike, Obi has said the desire to stay close to his family was the reason for leaving Tianjin Teda of China. Mikel said he missed his family hence he decided to get closer to them by moving back to England. The Chelsea legend had oneyear still to run on his contract with Tianjin Teda before he quit the club. ”I look at my time in China as an experience it wasn’t bad,” Mikel said explained.“Everyone was so nice but sometimes you miss home and that’s what I did. I missed home and wanted to come back.” Meanwhile Mikel has expressed confidence his side will get an away win on Wednesday when they play against Sheffield United in the English Championship. The former Chelsea star believes his side showed character against Leeds United at the weekend, and they can step up from that level to pick a better result. While also hailing the role played by their fans in the 1-1 draw at the Riverside, Mikel is of a view that Boro gave a lot of effort, aggression, determination and eye for goal, but admits it was a huge disappointment seeing Leeds share the points with a late equaliser. “Everything was there for us to have a good game. We were aggressive; we won the ball, and got in their faces. “We tried to play and created chances. To concede in the last minute is disappointing but we have to keep going. “We have another big game on Wednesday and hopefully we can get the three points then.”
