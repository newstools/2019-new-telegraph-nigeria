A 13-year-old primary six pupil has been delivered of a baby at the Central Hospital, Benin, Edo State. The girl, who hails from Cross River State, was impregnated by her 42-year-old father, Mr. Friday Moses. The teenage mother was delivered of her baby on Saturday, last week.
She was still in primary school when her dad impregnated her. The teenager has since then been in protective custody of the Edo State government.
It was learnt that she is the eldest daughter of her father. Moses, a commercial motorcyclist, had been having sex with his own daughter when she was seven years old, shortly after the death of the girlâ€™s mother. A Family Court sitting in the state had in October last year sentenced the man to 14 years imprisonment with hard labour without an option of fine for the abominable act. The girl had told journalists in Benin that she would like to continue with her education in order to fulfil her ambition of becoming a medical doctor.
But at the time her father impregnated her, she was yet to sit for her First School Leaving Certificate examination. The teenager therefore appealed to good-spirited individuals and organisations to come to her aid by supporting her education. The Medical Director of the hospital, Dr. Philip Ugbodaga, said yesterday that he had directed the management to cancel the medical bills of the teenage mother. Ugbodaga said the hospital was in collaboration with the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development to take proper care of the girl and her baby. He added that subsequent assistance for the victim would be based on situation that arose.
The Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Development, Ms Magdalene Ohenhen, could not be reached yesterday for comments on the matter.
