The Flying Eagles of Nigeria will today confront South Africa in the third place match at the 2019 CAF U-20 AFCON which ends on Sunday. The seven- time winners had their dream shattered by Mali on Wednesday via a penalty shootout loss after both sides had battled to a 1-1 draw after regulation and extra time. Although, the Flying Eagles were far from impressive in the defeat to the Bamako Eagles, a third meeting against South Africa provides them the opportunity of consoling Nigerian fans who were disappointed at their outing in the defeat to Mali. Both sides played a goalless outing in their second group meeting earlier in the championship – a game Nigeria dominated but were denied victory due to poor marksmanship. Although Paul Aigbogun defended this team’s outing as he refrained from blaming any of his players for they loss to Mali, the onus lies on the players to redeem their image. With the intense rivalry between Nigeria and South Africa in recent times at various CAF tournaments, this match promises to be keenly contested despite the fact that the sides have met their primary target; qualifying for the World Cup slated for Poland in May.
