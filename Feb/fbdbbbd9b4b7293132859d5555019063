Drinking more than four cans of diet soda per week may cause a type of diabetic eye disease that leads to blindness.
This is the findings of a new study published in the journal ‘Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology’.  Diabetic retinopathy is a condition that damages the retina. Small blood vessels keep the retina healthy but if blood glucose levels are high for too long it can block those blood vessels. According to the author of the study Eva Fenwick, Ph. D, the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy is two-fold.  Fenwick is a clinical research fellow at the Singapore Eye Research Institute and an assistant professor at the Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.
People in the study who drank regular soft drinks with sugar did not experience the same result.  The study included 609 adults. Seventy three of them had type 1 diabetes, 510 had type 2 diabetes and 26 had an unknown type of diabetes, that leads to scar tissue forming and impaired eyesight, according to report in the ‘newsmaxhealth’. In his comments on diabetic retinopathy, Dr. Adetunji Adenekan, a consultant ophthalmologist at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), said the incidence of diabetic retinopathy, which is a cause of blindness in diabetic patients, is increasing globally and in Nigeria.
He described retinopathy is any damage to the retina of the eyes, which may cause vision impairment. Retinopathy often refers to retinal vascular disease, or damage to the retina caused by abnormal blood flow. He said, “Out of all the multiple folds that people are having in the incidence of diabetes, Nigeria has the highest for Africa and Africa is the highest out the whole world and that is because of the high incidence of diabetes that is reported in the country.
“The more diabetic incidents that we have the more we are going to have more diabetic retinopathy and visual loss from that.’’
