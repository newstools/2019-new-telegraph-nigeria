The Supreme Court has upheld the judgement of the High court in Port Harcourt nullifying the primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State. A five-man panel of justices, presided by Jutsice Mohammed Dattijo on Friday dismissed the objection of the Tonye Cole faction of the APC that it had earlier withdrawn from the appeal against the judgement. An Appeal Court in Port Harcourt on December 12 dismissed the appeal filed by the Rivers State’s All Progressives Congress’ chairman, Flag Ojukaye, challenging the judgement of High Court’s Justice Chinwendu Nwogu over the conduct of the May ward congresses. The court also dismissed the appeal filled by APC governorship flag bearer, Tonye Cole, challenging the judgement. The court affirmed the judgment of Justice Nwogu that the state chapter of the APC had no ward, local government and state executives. The Court of Appeal Port Harcourt Division Special Panel, chaired by Justice Abubakar Yahaya, dismissed the two appeals for lack of merit.
