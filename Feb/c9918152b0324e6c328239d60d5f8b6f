A 31-year-old mother, Shaki Adebayo, who allegedly burnt her 12-year-old son with hot pressing iron, has been arraigned before a Tinubu Chief Magistrates’ Court, Lagos. The defendant, who resides at 210 Bamgbose St., Lagos Island, is facing a charge of assault occasioning grievous harm, an offence she has denied committing. The prosecutor, Sgt. Hafsat Ajibode, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on Feb. 10, at about 3:00p.m.at her residence. Ajibode alleged that the defendant, a mother of three, assaulted her 12-year-old first child, by burning his body with hot pressing iron for not returning from an errand on time. “Adebayo claimed that she sent her son on an errand since about 9 a.m and only came back at about 4:00p.m. “She inflicted injury on the boy with hot pressing iron out of anger for the boy’s irresponsible act. “A neighbour who was aware of the defendant’s maltreatment towards her three children forced the door open when she heard the boy’s screams and cries. “When she saw how badly the boy’s body was burnt, she came to the station to report the defendant, which led to her arrest,” Ajibode told the court. She said the offence contravened Section 243 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015, and attracts seven years’ imprisonment for an offender when convicted. The Chief Magistrate, Mr Tajudeen Elias, granted the accused N50,000 bail with one reliable surety, who must be a relative of the defendant. The case has been adjourned till March 13, for mention.
