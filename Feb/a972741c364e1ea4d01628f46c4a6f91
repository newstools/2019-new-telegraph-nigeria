Absence of Lagos State counsel yesterday stalled the trial of a former lecturer of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), Dr. Afeez Baruwa, accused of defiling an 18-year-old admission seeker (name withheld).
Baruwa was scheduled to open his defence at an Ikeja High Court yesterday, a year after the prosecution closed its case against him.
The trial, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), has experienced setbacks caused primarily by unavailability of counsel and the court not sitting for other reasons.
The lecturer arrived at the court at 9a.m. with his defence team and was ready to give evidence.
At 2.11p.m., when the case was to commence, Mr. O. A. Azeez, state counsel, present in court, informed the judge that Mr. Y. G. Oshoala, the lead prosecutor, wanted to cross-examine Baruwa himself as he was most familiar with the facts of the case.
Oshoala had been prosecuting the case since Baruwa was first arraigned.
No reason was given for Oshoala’s absence in court yesterday.
He said: “My lord, if it is convenient for the court, I can take the examination-in-chief of the defendant as Mr. Oshoala left instructions that he wants to personally cross-examine the defendant.”
Responding, Baruwa’s counsel, Mr. Olanrewaju Ajanaku, said the lecturer was ready to give defence.
He said: “My lord, learned counsel for the prosecution said Mr. Oshoala wants to personally take the cross-examination of the defendant.
“However, I want to be assured that, on the next adjourned date, the trial will go on.”
