Orji said the sensitive materials affected were smart card readers meant for the general elections. “I don’t have the details of how the fire started; all I know is that there was a fire incident involving the containers that house some of our sensitive materials. “We have to do an assessment before we can ascertain the extent of damage, we have been storing equipments in that facility since 2011,” he said. NAN reports that this incident is the second in the South East as INEC office in Isiala Ngwa, Abia was penultimate week gutted by fire by unidentified persons.
