 Hundreds of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) from Teachers Village IDP camp yesterday went on the rampage to protest starvation for over 40 days. The IDPs, who were mostly women and childrem from Baga, Kukawa and Monguno, took street leading to the camp. They blocked the Maiduguri-Kano Road and destroyed Bulunkutu roundabout, billboards and posters they came across.
The protest caused gridlock on the ever-busy Maiduguri-Kano Road, causing untold hardship for motorists and passers-by. It took the intervention of officials of the Mobile Police to bring the situation under control. The policemen dispersed the protesters when they reportedly fired canisters of tear gas at them. One of the IDPs from Kukawa, N’alla Ibrahim Bultu, said they took to the street to bring their plight to the notice of government and other humanitarian organisations. He said: “It is now over 40 days in the camp with no single food from government. Instead of paying attention to us, they are busy with campaigns. That is why we are destroying their posters and billboards.” Another IDP from Baba, Usman Abor, said: “We were busy trying to pick up the broken pieces of our lives when the Boko Haram sent us out of our homes. Some people said that the attacks have direct links with politicians.”
Fatima Ibrahim, an IDP from Kukawa, said they had spent almost two hungry months at Teachers Village camp. She said: “We are hungry; our children are seriously hungry. Thirty persons share a bag of rice. We are in need of foodstuffs; please tell them to bring food for us.”
