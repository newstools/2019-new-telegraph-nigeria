 Although findings by New Telegraph show that it had pumped in about $1.5 billion into the foreign exchange market less than two months into 2019, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is likely to carry out forex interventions on a lower scale this year compared with 2018, analysts at ARM Research have predicted.
In a report entitled, “January 2018 Economic Update – resurgence in FPI flows softens CBN intervention sales,” the experts stated that after the surge in capital outflows from the economy recorded towards the end of last year: “ The Investors and Exporters Window (IEW) witnessed a rebound in activities in the month of January with inflows (ex-CBN) rising to $2.6 billion (+79.8per cent MoM), to account for 95per cent (vs. 58.4per cent in December) of outflows (+10.3per cent MoM to $2.8 billion). “As a result, unmet demand at the window declined from $1.0 billion in December to $131 million in January. Reflecting the rebound in flows during the month, the apex bank intervention sales at the IEW declined 62.5per cent to $453 million (vs. $1.2 billion in December),” the analysts added.
Besides, the analysts noted: “Over the rest of 2019, we maintain our view that CBN intervention will come in relatively lower than the prior year with our estimate suggesting total outflow of $50.2 billion during the year, which is lower than $54.5 billion in FY 2018. “On inflows, having modelled crude oil production and price of 2.07mbpd and $55.95/bbl. for 2019 respectively, we forecast average monthly crude oil inflow to the CBN of $1.15 billion over 2019 with overall oil inflow for the year estimated at $13.83 billion (-10.2per cent YoY). For non-oil inflow, while we note the relative stability post-election in Q1 2019, we estimate total FPI flows over 2019 to decline 35.4per cent YoY to $7.6 billion.” This newspaper had reported on January 29 that in the first three weeks of January, CBN injected over $1.48billion into the foreign exchange market. The inflow came in the form of the apex bank’s interventions in the interbank forex market as well as its weekly forex sales to Bureaux De Change (BDCs) operators in the country. Specifically, data obtained by this newspaper indicates that CBN pumped a total of $1.18billion into the interbank forex market during the period and also sold $300million to about 4,000 BDCs ($75,000 per BDC). Until last December when the CBN introduced a special forex sale of $15,000 per BDC every Thursday due to what it said was increased forex demand during the Christmas and New Year festivities, each BDC was entitled to purchase $20,000 from the regulator on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. This means that with the new special Thursday sale each BDC has been buying a total of $75,000 per week from the CBN since December 2018. A Lagos-based BDC operator, who did not want to be named, told this newspaper that there was speculation in the sub sector that the special forex sale by the CBN on Thursdays was likely to continue until after the elections. The operator said: “Although CBN originally said the special Thursday sales was for increased forex demand during the Yuletide, it has not stopped selling the $15,000 to BDCs. In fact, we are hearing that this will continue until after the elections.”
According to the operator, the increased forex intervention by the CBN has been key to exchange rate stability during this election season. “Many people thought there would be exchange rate volatility during this election season but despite all the dollars we heard some of the politicians deployed to secure their nomination tickets, the naira has remained stable against the dollar,” the operator said.
Interestingly, in its 2019 economic outlook, Coronation Research had predicted that the CBN would pump $6billion into the forex market this year. Speaking on the report, Head of Coronation Research, Guy Czatoryski, said: “We forecast an average $58.00/bbl for 2019. An average much below this means the CBN will have to keep rates very high and could even challenge the Naira / US dollar exchange argument. An average much about $60.00/bbl means the CBN will have confidence its reserve position, and will be able to cut rates later in the year, in Q4, less likely Q3.
“The current rate of N365.29/US$1, or close to it, is likely to prevail this year. The CBN’s policy is to defend the rate and with reserves at US$43.0 billion, it is in a strong position to do so. We think the CBN will supply US dollars to the FX markets at an average rate of US$500m per month during 2019. This is compatible with maintaining a strong reserve level,” Czatoryski said.
