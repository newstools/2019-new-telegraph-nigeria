●El-rufai’s deputy loses to PDP  ●APC takes control of N’Assembly  It was dashed hope for two outgoing governors, who contested last weekend’s senatorial election as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), yesterday, declared more results of the senatorial election.  They governors are Ibrahim Dankwambo (Gombe) and Abiola Ajimobi (Oyo). Dankwambo, who contested for Gombe North Senatorial District seat on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), lost to the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Sa’idu Alkali, by 88,016 to 152,546 votes.  Ajimobi, who was the candidate of the APC for Oyo South Senatorial was defeated by his PDP counterpart, Kola Balogun. The PDP candidate polled 105,720 votes while Ajimobi had 92,217 votes. Similarly, the immediate past governor of Delta State, Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan, lost his senatorial bid.  Kaduna State deputy governor, Barnabas Bala Bantex Danjuma, who contested for Kaduna South senatorial seat on the platform APC also lost to the incumbent senator, Danjuma La’ah of the PDP. La’ah scored 268,923 to defeat Bantex, who polled 133,287 votes.  For most serving senators, it was shock as they failed in their re-election bid. As at press time yesterday, New Telegraph gathered that 25 out of the 66 senators, who contested last Saturday’s election were defeated.  With the results so far released, APC has taken control of the Senate.  A total of 33 senators had earlier lost out in primary elections, which took place in October last year. The Senate comprised 109 members.  Among those who lost their re-election bids according to results declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) are the Senate president, Bukola Saraki (PDP, Kwara Central), former Senate Minirity Leader, Godswill Akpabio; Rafiu Ibrahim (PDP, Kwara South), Tayo Alasoadura (APC, Ondo Central) and Yele Omogunwa (APC, Ondo South).  Others are Monsurat Sunmonu (ADC, Oyo Central), Rilwan Adesoji (ADP, Oyo South), Abiodun Olujimi (PDP, Ekiti South), Duro Faseyi (PDP, Ekiti North), Mao Ohuabunwa (PDP, Abia North), Andy Uba (APC, Anambra South) and Victor Umeh (APGA, Anambra Central).  Also on the losing side are Shittu Ubali (PDP, Jigawa North East), Shehu Sani (PRP, Kaduna Central), Mohammed, Hassan (PDP, Yobe South), Binta Masi Garba (APC, Adamawa North), Hamman Isa Misau (PDP, Bauchi Central), Ahmed Ogembe (PDP, Kogi Central), Attai Aidoko (PDP, Kogi East), Barnabas Gemade (SDP, Benue North East) and David Umaru ( APC Niger East).  This means that a total of 66 senators in the 8th National Assembly Senate will not return as eight others went for governorship primaries and succeeded. The casualty figure might increase among the remaining 41 senators since not all of them have been declared winners in the Saturday’s elections.  Kaduna State  Senator Danjuma La’ah of the PDP won the Kaduna South Senatorial District seat. INEC Returning Officer, Suleiman Yashim, announced the result yesterday in Kafanchan.
