Trading activities on the floor of Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) yesterday returned to the negative trajectory, shaving off N85 billion, as some market speculators remained on the sideline, while others take profits, as the nation awaits declaration of presidential poll results. Market analysts believe some savvy investors who took position in anticipation of change of government are pullingback, as it is becoming clearer that the opposition party may not make it to the seat of power. Consequently, the All- Share Index dropped by 274.38 basis points or 0.69 per cent to close at 32,473.82 index points as against 32,700.12 recorded last Monday, while the market capitalisation declined N85 billion to close from N12.194 trillion to N12.109 trillion. Meanwhile, a turnover of 322.2 million shares exchanged in 4,069 deals was recorded in the day’s trading.  The premium sub-sector was the most active (measured by turnover volume) with 82.3 million shares exchanged by investors in 1,261 deals. Volume in the subsector was largely driven by the activities in the shares of Access Bank Plc. and UBA Plc. Banking sub-sector, boosted by the activities in the shares of Diamond Bank Plc. and Guaranty Trust Bank Plc., followed with a turnover of 78.4 million shares in 774 deals.  The number of gainers at the close of trading session was 21, while decliners also closed at 20. Further analysis of the day’s trading showed that African Prudential Plc. topped the gainers’ table with 10 per cent to close at N4.84 per share, while Oando Plc. trailed with 9.85 per cent to close at N7.25 per share. AG Leventis Plc. gained 9.68 per cent to close at 34 kobo per share.  On the flip side, NPF MFB Plc. led the losers’ chart, dropping 9.70 per cent to close at N1.49 per share. Union Bank of Nigeria (UBN) Plc. tailed with a loss of 8.25 per cent to close at N6.55 per share, while Japaul Oil Plc. fell by 7.41 per cent to close at 25 kobo per share. Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Limited, Mr. Ambrose Omorodion, attributed the market bear run to profit taking embarked by some smart investors.  Omorodion said that the smart money that pushed the market up with expectations that the opposition would win the presidential election was leaving the market. Besides, he said that some investors who entered the market in anticipation that the opposition’s economic policy and reforms would support market growth were taking profit ahead of earnings season.  Omorodion, however, noted: “This pullback may not last as a result of 2019 dividend declaration season, as dividend yield of financial service stocks are high and attractive due to low prices.”
