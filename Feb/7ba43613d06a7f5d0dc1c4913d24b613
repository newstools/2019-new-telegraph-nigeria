Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi has approved N100 million monthly to clear accumulated gratuities of retired workers in the state.
The governor had last month approved a hundred per cent increase in monthly gratuity payment from N10 million to N20 million.
Fayemi, taking into consideration the current plight of many retired workers, who could not access their gratuity several years after retirement owing to paltry amount for gratuity payment, has directed the Ministry of Finance to further increase the monthly gratuity payment to N100 million per month. This was the amount paid per month during his first term.
According to a statement by Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Yinka Oyebode, the directive was with immediate effect pending when the state government would be able to find a creative approach to resolve the huge outstanding gratuity obligations of the state.
The governor, according to the statement believed the increment would go a long way in ameliorating the plight of the state’s pensioners.
Also, Fayemi in a related development approved payment of severance allowance and outstanding salaries of 19 former members of the Ekiti State House of Assemblies and their aides who were denied entitlement by the immediate past administration of Mr Ayodele Fayose.
According to Fayemi, “it is unjust to deny workers their wages, saying that his administration will “ensure that workers and pensioners get their entitlements as and when due.”
