Governorship candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Emeka Ihedioha and his All Progressive Congress (APC) counterpart, Senator Hope Uzodinma have accused Imo state Governor, Rochas Okorocha of being responsible for the killings of two indigenes of Agwa community during the governor’s Senatorial campaign rally at Ejemekwuru in Oguta council area of the state. The duo alleged that Okorocha’s security details had shot and killed the two young men who were protesting and agitating over long drawn neglect of Oguta by Okorocha to an extent that Oguta communities had been in darkness for almost eight years. But in a swift reaction, Okorocha’s Chief Press Secretary, Sam Onwuemeodo dismissed the allegation, describing it as untrue, stressing that only one person died as the clash which led to his death was between two rival cult groups. Onwuemeodo also advised Ihedioha, Uzodinma and others to honourably withdraw from the governorship race rather than resort to blackmail to sustain their failed ambitions. But Ihedioha insisted the alleged killing of unarmed youths in Oguta as another killing too many by the Rochas Okorocha’s administration. Ihedioha in a statement said “the killing in Oguta is just a prelude to the large scale violence the APC and their associates in AA and APGA are planning to unleash on the people of the state in their desperate bid to manipulate the 2019 elections. “We therefore call on the security agencies, INEC and other relevant agencies to keep an eye on Imo state against the violence the APC are preparing to unleash on the good people of the state during the 2019 elections. “The Rochas Okorocha government and their APC rivals have been heating up the polity unnecessarily and the Imo state Command of the Nigeria Police Force does not seem to have any answer for the situation. “Just recently, the house of a House of Representatives’ candidate from Oguta LGA was demolished and in retaliation the youths of the community burnt a Police Van and took the policemen and the court officer who allegedly went for the demolition hostage after they were said to have been manhandled.
