A coalition of groups under the aegis, Coalition for Leah, yesterday called on all the presidential candidates to assure Nigerians that they would bring back Leah Sharibu if elected.
The group made the call while briefing journalists in Abuja to mark Leah’s one year in captivity. Speaking on behalf of the group, Mr. Emmanuel Ogebe said the candidates should tell Nigerians how they intended to rescue Leah and others still in such situation. According to him, it is disheartening that throughout the campaigns, none of the candidates said anything about ensuring Leah and other abductees’ release. He said: “We are urging the political parties and their candidates on the need to address the issue of Sharibu and others now that the campaigns have been re-opened.
“The girl has been gone for too long, so tell us how you are going to bring her and the remaining Chibok girls back to their parents.” Also, Mr. Godswill Iyoke said that Leah, by refusing to renounce her faith, demonstrated uncommon courage that should be emulated by politicians who usually abandon one political party for another. Iyoke, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), said Leah had demonstrated that she was a highly principled Nigerian, willing to pay a price for it and should be brought back to contribute to the development of the county. Also yesterday, a faith-based Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), Interfaith Dialogue Forum for Peace (IDFP), called on the Federal Government to secure the release of Leah from the captivity of Boko Haram. Bishop Sunday Onuoha of Methodist Church, Nigeria, and an executive co-chair of the NGO, made the call while addressing a press conference in Abuja.
Onuoha appealed to the Federal Government to fulfil its promise of ensuring that Leah was freed from the custody of her abductors.
