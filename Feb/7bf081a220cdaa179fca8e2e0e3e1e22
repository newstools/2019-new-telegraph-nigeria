The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) has charged Nigerians to remain unshaken in spite of the rescheduling of the general elections by a week. PFN appealed to Nigerians, particularly Christians, not to give up, saying that the postponement would not change the outcome of the elections. This is contained in a statement by PFN National Vice-Chairman (South-South), Bishop Simeon Okah. He urged the electorate to turn out en masse to cast their votes for the candidates of their choice. The Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission Prof. Mahmood Yakubu had announced the postponement of the elections owing to logistics problems on Saturday. Okah said, “Let us all understand that postponement of election date cannot postpone or change the will of God. We must remain positive and speak positively to all our neighbours. “Speak positively about the elections. We must remain resolute and ensure we cast our votes. “No action should weigh us down or deter us. Except you want things to remain the way they are. But if you want real change, then be ready to make all sacrifice.
“By the grace of God, next Saturday, we should all come out again and ensure we vote. “We do not have any country other than Nigeria. We must remain and build it together.
“God will not allow the devices of the enemies of this nation to prevail.”
