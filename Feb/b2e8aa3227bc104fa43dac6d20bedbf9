The name of Childish Gambino, the American rapper, actor and comedian whose real name is Donald McKinley Glover Jr., deservedly rang out loud last week as he won four Grammy awards with his politically-charged and conscious hit song, “This Is America” including the hugely coveted Record of the Year Earlier, Song of the Year (Best Songwriting), Best Rap/Sung Performance as well as Best Music Video at the 61st edition of the ceremony.
However, it was for the award for Best Music Video won by Childish Gambino, who did not attend Sunday’s ceremony at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, that a Nigerian had come to reckoning being the creative responsible for the music video.
This person is none other than Ibra Ake, a Nigerian-American producer, writer and filmmaker, who by virtue of his work on the video of Gambino, which Nigerian music star, Falz, has recreated to acclaim, is now a proud recipient of his first Grammy Award.
Reacting to the Best Music Video for producing Childish Gambino’s visuals for ‘This is America’, Ake took to Twitter, writing: “I can’t believe I just won a Grammy. Where’s the catch? Royalty forever” via his username, @ibralikezebra while tagging collaborators like @famlikefamily @CHADMTAYLOR @MuraiHiro @SherrieSilver @sza @ludwiggoransson and @donaldglover himself.
Based in Los Angeles, California, believed to be the hotbed of entertainment activities in the United States of America, Ake, who is a visual artist, creative director and writer, has spent most of his life in America. In spite of calling America home, he is known to constantly credit his roots and upbringing in Nigeria for allowing him to understand the value of documentation and storytelling.
Growing up in Nigeria and New Jersey, “This is America” didn’t offer Ake the first opportunity of working with Childish Gambino; they have worked together on the hit TV show, Atlanta, on which he is a writer and Childish Gambino is cast.
