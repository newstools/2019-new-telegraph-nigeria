Corporation suffers 197 pipeline-vandalised points in one month  The crude oil and gas exports by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) have hit $5.97 billion in one year. The corporation, which revealed this in its Monthly Financial and Operations Report for the month of November 2018, declared that it suffered 197 pipeline-vandalised points in one month. Posting a total crude oil and gas sale of $668.57 million in November 2018, the NNPC noted that the November 2017 to November 2018 crude oil and gas transactions indicated that crude oil and gas worth $5.97 billion was exported.  The $668.57 million recorded in the month of November 2018, the corporation said yesterday, “is 26.13% higher than the previous month. Crude oil export sales contributed $574.95 million (86.00%) of the dollar transactions compared with $425 million contribution in the previous month.” Export gas sales amounted to $93.62 million in the month, it added. The NNPC, in a release by the its General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Mr. Ndu Ughamadu, added: “A total of 735 Million Standard Cubic Feet of gas per day (mmscfd) was delivered to gas fired-power plants in November 2018 compared with October 2018 where an average of 627mmscfd was supplied.”  The report showed that out of the 212.93 Billion Cubic Feet (bcf) of gas supplied during the period, a total of 123.29bcf of gas was commercialized, consisting of 36.14bcf and 87.15bcf for the domestic and export market respectively. It said this translated to a total supply of 1,204.76mmscfd of gas to the domestic market and 2,905.06mmscfd of gas supplied to the export market for the month, implying that 57.91% of the average daily gas produced was commercialized while the balance of 42.09% was re-injected, used as upstream fuel gas or flared.  The total gas supply between November 2017 and November 2018 stood at 3,071.13bcf out of which 466.44bcf and 1,317.77bcf were commercialized for the domestic and export market respectively. A further breakdown of the report indicated that gas-injected, fuel gas and gas flared stood at 1,286.92 bcf.  The November report, the edition 40th edition in the series, announced a trading surplus of N2.06 billion which represented a laudable improvement of 116% over the previous month’s deficit of N12.66billion. This increase in performance month-on-month was primarily attributable  to improved efficiency of the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company’s (NPDC) operations.  In the downstream sector, a total of 1.62bn litres of petrol, translating to 54.0mn liters/day, were supplied for the month. In November 2018 a total of 197 pipeline points were vandalized; out of which six pipeline points failed to be welded and two pipeline points were ruptured. The situation improved from the 219 vandalized points recorded in October 2018, with Mosimi-Ibadan, Ibadan-Ilorin and Aba- Enugu accounting for 58, 35 and 34 points respectively or approximately 29%, 18% and 17% of the vandalized points respectively. While Atlas Cove-Mosimi accounted for 13%, Warri- Kaduna and PHC-Aba accounted for 8% each and other locations accounted for the remaining 7% of the pipeline breaks.
