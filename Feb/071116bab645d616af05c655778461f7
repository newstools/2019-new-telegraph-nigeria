Police in Ogun State yesterday arrested two suspects for allegedly robbing two female police officers on their way to work. The suspects, Hafiz Omidokun (29) and Peter Babalola (27), were said to have committed the offence at Iyana-Ilogbo area of the state. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, who confirmed this in a statement in Abeokuta, said the suspected robbers “double-crossed the policewomen” with motorcycle and held them hostage with a locally-made pistol. Oyeyemi disclosed that after collecting their victims’ bags and mobile phones, the suspects tried to escape with their motorcycle but luck ran out on them when the officers raised the alarm. According to him, the suspects took to their heels but passers-by gave them a hot chase. Realising that they were about to be caught, the police spokesman said the suspects made an attempt to snatch another motorcycle to escape but were eventually apprehended. He said: “The women were driving in a car belonging to one of them from Ifo going to Sango Ota and on getting to Iyana-Ilogbo area, the two suspects suddenly double-crossed them with motorcycle and held them hostage with a locally-made pistol. “They were about to be lynched by angry mob when the DPO, Sango Division, CSP Oyedele Nasirudeen, who had earlier received the distress call, arrived with his patrol team and rescued them and took them to the station.” “Recovered from them are one locally-made pistol, one expended cartridge and a motorcycle.”
The PPRO said the state Commissioner of Police, Ahmed Iliyasu, had ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) for discreet investigation.
