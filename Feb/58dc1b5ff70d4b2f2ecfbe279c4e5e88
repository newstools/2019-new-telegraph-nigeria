Meanwhile, the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, has given the assurance that the party will reopen closed industries in Kaduna State. Atiku who spoke yesterday at a town hall meeting in Kaduna, also promised to restore the state as the pride of the North. He regretted the spate of insecurity in the state, which resulted to the displacement of people from their homes, but assured that the problem would be squarely tackled, if elected as president. PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus told the people that President Muhammadu Buhari has abandoned them after electing him as their president. According to Secondus, rather than care for the needs of Nigerians, President Buhari introduced polices that made the country headquarters of global poverty. “Under Buhari and the APC, your situation has gone from bad to worse. You lost your jobs because industries folded up. Under his watch, it has been endless bloodletting and divisive policies that have left us more divided than ever. “Atiku Abubakar, the candidate PDP is presenting to you to be the next president of Nigeria, will rectify everything, unite Nigerians, create jobs, open up our industries and tackle poverty squarely. He has the experience in both public and private sectors and is well equipped for the job,” Secondus said.
