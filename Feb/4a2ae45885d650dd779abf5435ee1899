Chief Lucky Igbinedion, former two-term governor of Edo State, who is the first son of one of the richest and illustrious personalities in that part of the country, Sir Gabriel Igbinedion, has remained in his shell by adopting a very low profile.  Unlike other former governors who have remained active in partisan politics, Lucky has neither been visible at the party nor seek any public office as he has faced his businesses squarely. He’s only heard when his father celebrated his birthday anniversary which is like a tradition in the household of the Igbinedion’s.  Lucky Igbinedion is in the news again, but sadly, it is over a very unfortunate incident that has thrown the entire Igbinedion dynasty as well as their friends and well –wishers into a state of mourning. Very disturbing news few days ago got into circulation that the dark skinned politician, Lucky and his wife, Ekhi, lost their son to the cold hands of death.  The deceased, Osaretin, second son of the former Edo first couple, it was learnt died in an automobile accident in United States of America. Expected, the sad occurrence has brought a very serious quietness in the Igbinedion’s household due to the loss of one of them at a very young age
