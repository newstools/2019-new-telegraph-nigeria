Ahead of Saturday’s elections, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), has alerted the public to the circulation of “fake dollars” in the country. The Commission said its alarm was a product of intelligence gathering to that effect. A statement by the EFCC’s Acting Head of Media and Publicity, Mr. Tony Orilade, said: “The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has raised the alarm over the circulation of fake Dollar notes ahead of Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections”. According to Orilade: “In a statement personally signed by the Acting Chairman of the Commission, Ibrahim Magu, the agency stated that the warning follows intelligence gathered in the build-up to the elections. “The intelligence indicates that the Dollar notes have features of genuineness, but forensic analysis by the Commission reveals otherwise. “We, therefore, warn the BDC operators to be cautious in their transactions from now till the end of the elections”.
