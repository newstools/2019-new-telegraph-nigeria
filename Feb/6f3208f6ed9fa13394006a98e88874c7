Super Eagles forward, Samuel Kalu would be out of his side’s next two games after his suspension was increased to three games following the red card he received in a rescheduled matchday 18 clash between Bordeaux and Marseille earlier this month. The winger was hopeful he will only receive a one-game suspension for the incident after missing last week’s clash against PSG, but following a disciplinary committee review of the incident, he will now be forced to sit out two more fixtures for Bordeaux. The decision will come as a big blow for the Ligue 1 strugglers who are winless in their last four games and will host neighbours Toulouse this weekend in a derby match. As a result of the suspension, the 21-year-old will be unavailable for Sunday’s clash at home to Toulouse and will also miss Wednesday’s home clash against Guingamp but should return for next weekend’s visit to FC Nantes. Kalu arrived in Bordeaux earlier this summer from Belgium side KAA Gent and has gone on to become a key member of the squad, scoring four goals and assisting three more in all competitions.
