A 16-year-old teenage shop assistant (name withheld) was arraigned at an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos for allegedly absconding with her employer’s cloths worth N800,000. The accused, who resides at No 8, Anifowoshe St., Oko-Oba, Lagos, is facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing to which she pleaded not guilty. The Police Prosecutor, Insp.

John alleged that the accused while working as a shop assistant in a boutique, stole the cloths valued at N800,000 belonging to her employer, the complainant, Mrs Ann Nwokoro. “The accused stole the cloths and absconded with it when the complainant was not around. “All attempt made by the complainant to get her cloths back was unsuccessful as the accused switched off her phone. “She was later arrested and handed over to the police,” he said.

The Chief Magistrate, Mr P.E Nwaka, granted the accused bail in the sum of N100,000 with two sureties in like sum.
