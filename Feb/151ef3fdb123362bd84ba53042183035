The presidential candidate of the People’s Trust (PT), Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, has written to the chairman of the Independent National Electoral, Prof. Mahmoud Yakubu, requesting a further extension of the date for the presidential and National Assembly elections. In his letter copied to the United Nations representatives, election observers, civil society groups and the diplomatic community, Olawepo- Hashim said the one week extension is rather too short to conclude the stated enormous logistics requirement for the polls. According to him, another extension is reasonable in view of the logistics burden on the contestants and the parties as they have to repeat logistics preparations that have hitherto been deployed to achieve the level of mobilization for the February 16, scheduled election. He stated: “It is my considered opinion that in the haste to stick to a quickly announced date for the election, the commission may not have paid adequate attention to the attendant voter apathy that may result if adequate confidence building measures are not implemented to win back ‘would-be’ voters for the next date of polling. “A new date of election should be between three to four weeks from February 16, not one week as previously announced. This is more so for self-funded candidates and political parties, who do not have the possibilities or intentions of falling quickly on state treasury to refinance another logistic deployment.” The PT candidate added that campaigns should also resume in line with extant legislations that allow such to continue up till 24 hours before elections in order to achieve the same level of mobilisation of voters as before February 16.
