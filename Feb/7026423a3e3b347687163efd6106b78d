Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, yesterday said internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the state would exercise their franchise in their various ancestral homes during the 2019 general election.
According to Lalong, his administration had relocated majority of the IDPs to their ancestral homes. He spoke in Jos, the state capital, when the management of Grand Cereals Nigeria Limited, donated assorted relief materials, mainly products of the company, for delivery to IDP camps in the state. The governor, represented by the Chairman, Plateau Relief Committee and Commissioner for Water Resources and Energy in the state, Hon. David Wuyep, said the state government was committed to alleviating the sufferings of the IDPs. He added that his administration was working towards ensuring that all IDPs return to their ancestral homes before the elections. He said: â€œIn December last year, the state government facilitated the return of IDPs from Gashish to their homes, more would soon return to their homes before and after the elections, and majority will exercise their franchise during the elections. Earlier, Acting Deputy Managing Director of the company, Mr. Sanjev Jain, while donating the relief materials, said Grand Cereals had increased its corporate social responsibility (CSR) activation to cater for the need of IDPs and other vulnerable groups in the society.
