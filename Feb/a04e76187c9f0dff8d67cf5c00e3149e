Policemen in Lagos have disrupted the venue of a “Free Lagos” Press conference in Lagos, New Telegraph can report. The press conference which held in at the premises of Lagos Airport Hotel in Ikeja is being organised by a group known as ‘Orange Movement for a Free Lagos State’ with the theme, “Setting Lagos free from Bourdillon Bondage, #OtogeLagos” The conveners of the group comprise of former President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Olisa Agbakoba, Spokesperson of Afenifere Group, Mr. Yinka Odumakin and Senator Tokunbo Afikuyomi, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC). While some participants had already seated inside the Oranmiyan Hall where the event was to hold, scores of other participants who stormed the Airport Hotel gate were stopped by a detachment of armed policemen mobilised to the scene. The policemen did not allow anybody to come inside the hall. In the ensuing drama, the policemen fired several shots to disperse the crowd with people running helter-skelter within the premises.
