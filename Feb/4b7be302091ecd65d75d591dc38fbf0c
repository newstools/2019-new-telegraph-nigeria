A 31-year-old man, Adedokun Adewumi, who claimed to be a businessman, on Wednesday appeared before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly collecting N3.1 million from a man on the pretext to supplying him farm produce. Adewumi, who gave no fixed address, is facing a three-count charge bordering on conspiracy and fraud. The Prosecutor, Peter Nwangwu, said that the defendant committed the offences between the months of October 2017 and January 2018, at Anthony Village, Lagos. He said the defendant conspired with one Sola Adegboye, who is still at large, to collect the sum of N3.1 million from the complainant, Mr Ibrahim Sherif, under the guise of supplying him cassava chips, bags of brown rice and brewery waste. Nwangwu said that the defendant collected the said amount from the complainant and promised to supply the farm produce. “He failed to deliver the said goods to the complainant and started threatening him whenever he reached the defendant on phone. “Adewunmi absconded with the money but was later caught; he promised to refund the money but failed to do so,” the prosecutor said. The offences contravened Sections 287, 314 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. Chief Magistrate Yewande Aje-Afunwa granted the defendant N700, 000 bail with two responsible sureties in like sum. She said the sureties should be gainfully employed with evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State Government, and one of them should be a relation of the accused. Aje-Afunwa adjourned the case until April 25 for mention. (NAN)
