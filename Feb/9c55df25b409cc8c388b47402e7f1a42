Former vice-president and presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, yesterday promised to complete the Mambilla Dam if elected in the February 16 presidential election.
Atike made the promise while addressing party faithful at a presidential campaign rally in Jalingo, Taraba State. The former vice-president noted that the current administration was paying lip services to the project and had failed to even pay compensation to indigenes of the area let alone mobilise contractors to site.
Abubakar, who promised to pay attention to federal roads in the state, also urged security agencies to remain neutral and provide a level playing field for all participants to avoid a chaotic situation. “Give me your votes on February 16 and I will turn things around in our home state of Taraba. Unlike the scam that this government is exhibiting about the Mambilla Dam, I will complete the project and provide all the good things that come with it. I will also reimburse the state with regards to the federal roads that the state government constructed and the government of the day has refused to pay them because they are from opposition party. “At this point, every Nigerian desires the opportunity to elect leaders of their choice. As such, let me call on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the security agencies to remain neutral and allow a level playing field for all participants in the forthcoming general election.” PDP National Chairman, Mr. Uche Secondus, urged the people to vote PDP in all the elective positions so that they can experience massive employment, peace and economic growth and stability.
He urged the people to not only vote, but to make sure that they remain watchful and protect their votes as that was the only way to make sure their votes count.
