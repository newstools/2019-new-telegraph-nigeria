The health care industry has continued to battle operational challenges, which has impacted the bottom line of Neimeth Pharmaceuticals Plc. CHRIS UGWU writes  Apart from the rising cost of raw materials, driven by the challenging macro economic environment, the problems, which range from intense competition, low capacity utilization, faking and adulteration of original brands as well as low purchasing power, have been giving the pharmaceutical industry a reputation of low profitability and return on investment. Added to these challenges were the fiscal and monetary headwinds, which have resulted in marked reduction in domestic output. Some manufacturers who have taken up foreign currency loans are groaning under the pressure of the increased cost of the dollar. Given these headwinds, most consumer goods companies in Nigerian have continued to find it difficult to weather the storm. Health care industry was not insulated, as the sector is still seen as a weaker competitor, when compared with international firms in spite that the sector holds good potential in Nigeria. However, despite these harsh milieu, some health care companies in Nigeria have been rated by as performers contributing to the economic development of the country. Some of these companies are making strong stride on the back of the federal government’s commitment towards making the sector self-sufficient as well as improving the overall standard and quality of its products and service delivery – thereby making the constituent companies able to compete internationally. However, the overall economic and business climate have been a mixed for manufacturing companies due to mounting economic challenges, hence; Neimeth Pharmaceuticals Plc like its peers was not insulated. The company had ended the year 2018 on a positive trajectory, as it returned to profitability from loss position in the year 2017. It also began the current financial year in an unimpressive note, reverting to loss position, which market watchers majorly attributed to weak consumer demands, stiffer competition and lack of accessibility to key markets in the Northern part of the country coupled with increased financing cost, which have resulted in slow growth of many fast moving consumer goods FMCG) companies. Market sentiments for the shares of Neimeth, which is listed on the floor of the Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE), has also dwindled relatively due to challenging environment, just like other quoted firms in Nigeria facing depression in share prices. The share price, which closed at 82 kobo per share in March 2018 has recorded a dip in growth, closing last Friday at 70 kobo, a decline of 12 kobo or 14.6 per cent year-to-date.

Operational challenges Chairman of the company, Dr. ABC Orjiako, said at the 2018 Annual General Meeting (AGM) : “At our AGM last year, I had good reason to commend the Central Bank of Nigeria for the multiple access channels for foreign exchange, which I said “contributed to easing external trade especially in importing critical production inputs. “Regrettably, the street channel was the dominant source of foreign exchange in 2018 with the huge third party risk in acquisition of FX hanging over manufacturers as the Sword of Damocles. The banks that should be the assured sources of FX were primarily sources of commission costs taken for perpetual biddings that yield little or no allocations. Why the system that came successful as an experiment in 2017 could not be made more perfect in 2018 is part of our nation’s proficiency in deconstruction. “2018 being penultimate election year it would have been a miracle to expect any betterment in our energy and other infrastructural deficiencies. Manufacturing had to live with those endemic impediments. Inflation continued to moderate; at a time coming below 10.5 per cent before creeping back to 11.10 per cent by the end of September 2018. “Research is the work done today that secures the future. In pharmaceutical manufacturing, this is an axiom. But research is a painful and time consuming exercise often with outcomes as uncertain as sea voyage on a sail. Yet this is effort that neither excites our policy makers nor the regulators as demonstrated, not by what is said, but by what is done. No subsidies on research expenditures or tax exemptions on such costs. Nonetheless Neimeth continues to be an active participant in this arduous field of pharmaceutical endeavour especially in the orphan diseases afflicting our people.” Outlook Orjiako noted that in 2016/17 financial year the company was challenged by adversity when fire gutted its raw materials warehouse on March 7, 2017. “In one single year, 2017/18, we were able to overcome the crippling incident and are ready to resume our march forward, he said. “The board has restarted implementation of its management reset that commenced with the hiring of our former Managing Director three years ago. Her departure and the fire incident put a temporary halt to the execution of the comprehensive reset that would presage our growth strategy. We have completed the process leading to the engagement of a new MD/CEO who would join the company in the second quarter of this 2018/19 financial year. “Other changes at the senior management level are in the works and would be completed soonest. These changes are meant to drive the vigorous expansion program and growth your Board has harboured for a while now. Our vision encompass increased import circumference as well as enhanced domestic manufacturing of our flagship brands. Last line Though high cost of operations have remarkably weighed down on the manufacturing sector, it is important for the company to continue to manage its cost base tightly to deliver moderate operating margins improvement for growth and profitability.
