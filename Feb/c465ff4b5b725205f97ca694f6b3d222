Wife of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP gubernatorial candidate in Gombe State, Maryam Bayero Nafada, has assured electorate that the party would protect their interests and facilitate social and infrastructural development if given the mandate. Reacting on the impromptu postponement of the February 16 Presidential and National Assembly elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, the wife of the guber candidate called on the PDP supporters in the state to remain calm, resolute and wait till the rescheduled February 23 to vote for the candidates of the party at all level assuring them that they’ll never regret voting for the PDP. Addressing journalists in Gombe, Maryam Bayero said, it was very sad and unfortunate that a commission like INEC headed by a Professor could after having sufficient funding and time announce a postponement few hours to voting on grounds of logistical problems. ‘’It’s really sad and disappointing for INEC to postpone election few hours to the commencement of voting while the same people have at several times told Nigerians that they’re fully prepared for the polls. This is ridiculous.’’ She said. She further said ‘’Postponing election by INEC and the APC government is just like extending the inevitable and imminent defeat because people are determined to vote for PDP whichever date elections hold and they’ll never regret doing that.’’ Hajiya Maryam Bayero has since the commencement of the campaign led the women wing and had went to all the nooks and crannies of Gombe State soliciting votes for her husabnd and other PDP candidates.
