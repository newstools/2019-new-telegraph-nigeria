Arsenal coach Unai Emery reckons that Alex Iwobi has impressed this campaign, just as he admitted that the winger has room for improvement.  The Nigeria international has contributed to five goals (two goals and three assists) in his last 10 games in the English Premier League, which helped Arsenal register six wins and one draw.  Iwobi was in fine form for the Gunners against Southampton until his injury-enforced replacement in the 75th minute.  ”I am very happy and I think he is working a lot to improve and he has energy, he has quality, he has things to improve. But he can do that,” Emery told arsenal.com.  ‘For us, we have to be demanding with him and he himself be demanding to improve the things that he can get better at in his qualities.”  The Spaniard added: ”When he’s getting into the attacking third, into the box, [he needs] to be calm to decide the last action with assists and scoring more.  “But he is giving us a lot of attacking moments and opening space for other players when they are arriving to the ball.”  Iwobi trained fully with his Arsenal teammates at London Colney in St Albans on Tuesday ahead of today’s meeting with Bournemouth in the Premier League.
