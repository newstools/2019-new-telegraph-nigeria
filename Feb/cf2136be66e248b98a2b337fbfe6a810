The Department of State Services (DSS) has warned the public against having any dealing whatsoever with its former Director General, Mr. Lawal Daura, as it said doing so would be at the person’s peril.
This was as the DSS further stated that Daura no longer had control over the service since his sack last year. It would be recalled that then Acting President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, had asked Daura, following the invasion of the National Assembly by operatives of the secret police. The services’ Public Relations Officer, Mr. Peter Afunanya, who conveyed the warning in a statement yesterday, vowed that impersonators, no matter how highly-placed, would be arrested and prosecuted. “The attention of the Department of State Services (DSS) has been drawn to insinuations and wide speculations that its former Director-General, Alhaji Lawal Musa Daura, still controls affairs at the agency, long after his removal from office. “While the service debunks this false belief, it warns that any person or group that further engages him or his representatives/associates does so at their own peril. “The service will not tolerate acts of impersonation designed to undermine it and will decisively deal with person(s), no matter how highly placed, that may engage in such behaviour. “The public should therefore note this and avoid circumstances under which unsuspecting persons may be deceived,” Afunanya said. He added that; “…the DSS continues to recommit itself to the core values of professionalism, selflessness, vigilance and the rule of law that it has always been identified with.”
