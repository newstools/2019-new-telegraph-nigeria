Flying Eagles coach Paul Aigbogun has absolved his players of any blame despite losing to Mali in the semifinal of the CAF U-20 African Cup of Nations, insisting that they were unlucky in the tie. The Malians beat Nigeria 4-3 on penalties; the game had ended 1-1 after extra time but the Eagles were below par all evening. Aigbogun said the Malians were a difficult side to beat and there was no shame to succumb to a very good team. “It was a very difficult match against Mali and we fought as it should but unfortunately for us Mali won. “We congratulate the Malian team for their victory and qualification. Today we cannot say that something has not worked since the two teams were equal,” he said. Mali coach Mamoutou Kané was magnanimous in victory when he said luck was on their side. “It was a very exhausting match in the head and in the belly. Luck was with us so congratulations and courage to the Nigerian coach. “For us the goal is achieved we were the first team to have lost and we are today the first to qualify for the final.” “This is football and I could not express my joy like the others because for me what was to be celebrated is the match against Ghana,” he said.
