About 45 shops were destroyed when fire gutted a food section of the Birni Kudu market in the Bakin Dogo area near the Kaduna Central Market, Kaduna State.
The incident was said to have started about 2a.m. yesterday. The affected traders, who said they had lost millions of naira to the inferno, appealed to the Kaduna State government and other wealthy individuals to come to their aide.
The shops, said to have been built in the 70s, were mainly used for the sale and stocking of assorted foodstuffs like yam flour, cassava flour, guinea corn, beans, rice and others.
A trader in the market, Hajiya Aisha, said her family lost four shops to the inferno. She said: “The whole thing happened so fast. It was one of the guards who called us this morning (yesterday) to inform us of this unfortunate incident. “We are appealing to the state government and other spirited individuals to come to our aid. We have lost everything we had worked for to this fire. All we need now is help.”
However, when contacted, the Director, Kaduna State Fire Services, Paul Fidelis Aboi, said his team of firefighters responded to the distress call within two minutes. He said: “The fire may have started by 2a.m. as they claimed, but we responded within two minutes the information got to us and we have already supressed it from escalating into other areas.
“As at now, we are still investigating the immediate cause of the fire. But the season we are, that is harmmatan, is partly responsible for fire outbreak. We rely 100 per cent on emergency calls or people running to our office to lay complaints.”
