So not only can you wear your athletic inspired clothes as casual wear, they have slowly crept into our work wear as well.  Here we have the stripes of the pants which look like any generic sweat pants paired with a blouse to get the casual chic look infused with athletic edge.  The stripes down the pants are also elongating the silhouette so that this look would also be perfect on a day you do not want to be intimidated by anyoneâ€™s height.  Be sure to balance the look with a nice pair of heels, preferably pointy toes so as to avoid looking too frumpy and you will be fine.
