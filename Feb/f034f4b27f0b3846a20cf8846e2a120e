 Super Eagles Manager Gernot Rohr has said he has a better squad than when they featured at the last FIFA World Cup, saying he possesses some of the fastest and dangerous wingers on the continent. He said the presence of wingers like Samuel Kalu, Samuel Chukwueze and Moses Simon had offered his side a competitive edge and that should count as they head for African Cup of Nations in Egypt in June. He said they were relishing the chances of playing in AFCON for the first time since 2013 and his players would display quality needed at that level.
”It is already good to be qualified because Nigeria didn’t qualify for the last two editions of Africa Cup of Nations. ”They went to the World Cup but were eliminated. There is no pressure, we always want to win of course but this is a natural pressure in each game. ”Since the World Cup, we didn’t lose any game, we won most of them. We did very well and the young team without some players who didn’t come after the World Cup tried their best. ”We have very good wingers now who are quick, we have players who are coming from behind who can play in different strategies so we are progressing and we have to show it in the next games,” Rohr concluded. ”This big competition in June is the first time we have 24 teams, it will be more difficult to be the winner of this competition but we have good ambitions and we have a young team who want to do well, so let’s prepare to be ready on the 15th of June.”
