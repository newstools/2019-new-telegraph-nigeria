The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Union (AU) and the United Nations (UN) has urged the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to exercise restraint on its rejection of the results of the 2019 presidential election, particularly as they are still in the process of being released.  The three international organisations called on all candidates, political parties and, indeed, all Nigerians to continue to exercise patience, calm and restraint, in order to allow for the full results of the election to be released by the Independent National Elections Commission (INEC). They said that at the end of the process, all aggrieved parties and persons should seek legal redress through the courts, in accordance with the Constitution and relevant laws of Nigeria.  They also urged all political parties to ensure adherence to the Peace Accord as agreed on 13th February, 2019.
