 The Eagles of Mali on Sunday defeated Young Teranga Lions Senegal 3-2 on penalties to win the 2019 U-20 AFCON in Niamey, Niger.
Having won the earlier meeting of the two sides in the group stage, Senegal were the favourites but they were shocked as Mali opened scoring in the 16th minute through B Traore.
The Malians, who accounted for the exit of Flying Eagles of Nigeria in the semifinals, came under severe pressure from the Senegalese who deservedly drew level midway into the second half as substitute A Ndiaye followed up a split shot by Kiota in goal for Mali.
Both sides failed to break further in the extra time and the dreaded penalty was needed to separate them at the Stade General Seyni Kountche watched by CAF president Ahmad Ahmad and a host of CAF top officials.
Mali converting three of their four kicks while Senegal, who opened the penalty kicks, managed to score two from their five kicks.
It’s the first time Mali will be crowned winners of the biennial championship while Senegal are still in search of their first title with Sunday’s result meaning they are runners up in the last three editions.
