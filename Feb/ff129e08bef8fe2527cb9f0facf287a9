According to the secretary of the APC in Abia State, Mr. Perfect Okorie, top chieftains of the Peoples Democratic Party (APC) in the state have been boasting of their personal relationships with the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) of INEC, in Abia State, Mr. Joseph Ilo. The scribe, while urging political parties not to manipulate the electoral process, admonished the electorate to be vigilant, adding that the era of rigging and violence was over in Abia state. Speaking with stakeholders of the party in Igbere on Friday, Okorie, stressed that APC would come out victorious in the forthcoming elections. He said: “In the past, elections were rigged by the PDP in Abia State. The PDP is jittery because of the unpopularity of the PDP led Abia State Government. “The people will resist any form of violence, intimidation and manipulation before, during and after the poll. “The APC based on its ideals will continue to champion the cause of good governance anchored on probity, transparency and accountability. “The APC candidates are people with intimidating and unbeatable pedigree and as such, the party is sure of victory.”
