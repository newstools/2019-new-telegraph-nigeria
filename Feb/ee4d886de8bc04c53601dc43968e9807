The Accord Party in Ogun State has dumped its governorship candidate, Sir Tope Tokoya, and adopted the standard bearer of African Democratic Congress (ADC), Prince Gboyega Isiaka, for the March gubernatorial election. The state executive of Accord led by its Chairman, Elder Isiaka Amusa; state Secretary, Nathaniel Sodipo, and three senatorial chairmen of the party announced this decision yesterday. Speaking during a visit to Isiaka at the latter’s residence in Abeokuta, Amusa said his party’s alliance with ADC was borne out of the desire to produce the best for the state. He explained that his party decided to adopt Isiaka based on the welfarist and people-oriented programmes he has for the masses of the state. According to him, the Accord Party will massively mobilise its members throughout the state to ensure total victory for Isiaka in the rescheduled March 9 governorship election. Also speaking, Sodipo called on other political parties to join hands with the ADC towards ensuring life of abundance for the people. “The essence of political parties is to bring dividends of democracy to our people and if that is what we are looking for, we have found that in Prince Gboyega Nasir Isiaka,” he stated. Responding, the ADC candidate expressed gratitude to the Accord Party for reposing confidence in him, saying he will not renege on his agenda to reposition the state. New Telegraph gathered that the decision by Accord to dump its candidate followed the failure of Tokoya to launch his campaign across the state since securing the governorship ticket last year. Efforts to get Tokoya’s reaction yesterday proved abortive at press time.
