 A former official of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Kola Al-Amin, has been arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for alleged forgery and obtaining money under false pretences.
The suspect was arrested by the Ibadan Zonal Office of the commission. His arrest followed a petition, which alleged that in November 2010, Al-Amin, who operates under the name of “Cool Technologies Consult Limited” with office located at No.4/900, Taiwo House, Second Floor, Yemetu Total Garden, Ibadan, Oyo State approached the complainant, a microfinance bank (name withheld) with a Local Purchase Order (LPO) for the supply of internet hardware which he claimed was from JAMB headquarters, Abuja. He requested the microfinance bank to give him a loan of N10,000,000 to finance the LPO. The EFCC spokesman, Tony Orilade, said: “The petitioner further alleged that Kola (Al-Amin) was granted the loan with the agreement that the proceed of the LPO from JAMB will be paid directly into his account with the microfinance bank but that at maturity time for repayment, he allegedly disappeared and on verification of the LPO in JAMB headquarters, Abuja, it was discovered that the LPO provided by the suspect was forged and that he was no longer a ‘staff’ of the organisation. “Additional investigation revealed that the suspect has been involved in several other fraudulent deals under the same guise of being a JAMB official. He will be charged to court upon conclusion of investigations.”
