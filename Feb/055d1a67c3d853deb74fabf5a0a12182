Consumers have expressed happiness over the rising price of beans which rose by 20 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018. A consumer Iya Tolani who spoke on Tuesday at the Alaba Rago Market, predominantly populated by Northerners in Lagos State disclosed that though the price has continued to come down, they still expect it to further come down at least the 2018 levels of N150 a Derica cup.
She, however, expressed happiness over gradual fall of the price beans and even rice, saying it will be good the can fall to the 2018 prices. Mrs. Ronke Malik, a dealer in several foodstuffs in the market, including rice, beans, garri, semovita and food condiments, disclosed that the people coming to buy rice and beans are many, “We are however hoping that the prices will continue to fall so that sales will rise again, as buyers are not yet impressed by the slight fall in the prices of the foodstuffs. According to her, the price of rice which is measured in kilogramme (kg), range from N4000 to N20, 000 She said: “During the Jonathan administration, that was before 2015; rice and beans wasn’t this expansive, the price was manageable and favourable to both the buyers and sellers. Mama Gold, one of the best premium rice sold in Nigeria was sold at between N9, 000 and N15, 000 for 50kg bag in 2018, now, the same quantity goes for N15,500-N20,000; over 25 per cent increase above the price it was sold that year. The difference between those years and now is much for us, the retailers and Nigerians will always complain about the price of goods before buying it which is not good for our business. Customers are our only source of income. The same also goes for the local rice i.e Ofada rice which was at N1000-N1500 for 5kg bag, but goes for N2000-N2500”. Mrs. Malik also disclosed that the prices of different species of beans have risen beyond the reach of the consumer in recent times. She said a 50kg bag of Oloyin Beans goes for N30,000 – N39,000 (depending on the market), while 25kg bag sells at N15,000 – N19,000. Olotun (50kg) sales for N29,000 – N36,000; while the 25kg bage of Olotun beans goes for N14,000 – N17,500. At the Garage Market, Mrs. Elele, disclosed that the price of noodles has spiked with a carton of Indomie (small size) formerly sold at N1700 now sells for N2100. He lamented that patronage is now very low as customers who normally buy in large quantities now buy in bits and the gain from such sales is no longer encouraging. Meanwhile, a similar survey carried out by Sunday Telegraph showed that the price of cement in Nigeria changes like quicksilver as opposed to two years ago. A 50kg bag of cement now goes for N2, 800 as against N1, 700. The increase was attributed to high cost of Automotive Gasoline Oil (AGO), which is due to the unstable power supply and other reasons.
