A former presidential candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN), Dr Oby Ezekwesili, has restated her commitment to “absolute dedication to public accountability”. This was as the ex-Minister of Education identified “mud-raking tactics” the reason many intellectually- sound people stayed away from politics. Ezekwesili stated this yesterday in reaction to allegations that she looted campaign funds as presidential candidate of ACPN. She said: “More hilarious was the accusation that I raised and looted campaign donations. It is only morally bankrupt politics that can make anyone even imagine such accusation against me. “My absolute dedication to public accountability is widely known and no matter how much we had hoped to raise as campaign support from the public, we designed an accounting system to go beyond the basic minimum of accountability required by the Electoral Act. “For example, the accounting function and system was separate from my candidacy. It was independently managed for the campaign as you saw from the presentation just made by my Campaign Council. You could see the transparent details on what I contributed as a candidate, what we received as support from our fellow citizens and spent in the course of the campaign. “Such mud-raking tactics is the reason why our best minds abstain from offering themselves up for political office, thus leaving the worst of us to lead the rest. It won’t and can never stop me”, Ezekwesili said. She also debunked claims in some quarters, that she was using her candidacy as a bargaining chip for a ministerial position, saying she could not have done that, having rejected previous offers.
