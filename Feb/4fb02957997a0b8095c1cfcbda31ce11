Senator David Umaru (APC Niger East), has appealed the judgement of the Federal High Court Abuja, which nullified his candidature as the Senatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the Niger East Senatorial District in the February 16 elections. Justice F.O Giwa Ogunbanjo had in a judgement delivered on Thursday, declared Mohammed Sani Musa, who contested against Umaru in the partyâ€™s primaries in October last year as the rightful candidate to be presented to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the election. However, Umaru, who chairs the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, in a personally signed statement yesterday, said that he had appealed the judgement and sought for immediate stay of execution. He said the judgement stood logic on its head and against weight of evidence presented as the constitutional right of nomination of candidates for election resides with political parties and not court of law. The embattled politician called for calm among his supporters and assured them that he remained the authentic senatorial candidate of the APC for Niger East in the coming election next Saturday
