Justice M. S. Abubakar of the Federal High Court sitting in Warri, Delta State has convicted and jailed 11 people for oil theft. The convicts, who were prosecuted by the Port Harcourt Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), were, however, given an option of fine. The convicts – Ephraim Akpan, Agadagba Ochuko, Clement Tommy, Oyayefa Abonne, Bousou Kereotu, Dereye Harry, Lucky Abonne, Dapo Obdare, Friday Ibude, Ebi Ekokeme, and Vincent Elayegha – were found guilty of the two-count charge of illegal dealing in petroleum products preferred against them by the EFCC. The convicts and their vessel, MT Petroitti, were arrested on May 23, 2014 by officers of the Nigerian Navy following a tip-off. They were apprehended around Ofoma oil terminal in Delta State with about 272 metric tons of substance suspected to be crude oil and handed over to the EFCC. The convicts, the Acting Head, Media & Publicity of EFCC, Tony Orilade, said were first arraigned on March 4, 2015 and pleaded “not guilty” to the charges prompting the case to go into full trial. In his ruling, Justice Abubakar sentenced the each to three years in prison on count one, with an option of fine of N200,000 each. The vessel, MT Petroitti was also found guilty on count two and fined N500,000. The trial judge also ordered its forfeiture and the cargo on board (about 272 metric tons of crude oil) to the Federal Government.
