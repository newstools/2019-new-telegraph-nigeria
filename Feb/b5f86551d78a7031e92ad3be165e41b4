Mr. Friday Eluro, former special assistant to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, has been arraigned for allegedly stripping a lady and beating her to coma. Eluro was arraigned before a Chief Magistrate’s Court, Asaba, for assault. The accused allegedly mobilised more than 20 boys in his compound at Owa-Alero in Owa Kingdom of Ika North East Local Government Area to assault the woman. Irked by the video of the assault, which was trending on the social media, Okowa ordered the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Hon. Festus Ovie Agas, to sack Eluro. Also, the Obi of Owa Kingdom, Dr. Emmanuel Efeizomor II, who made Eluro a traditional chief, derobed him. Also, three other people, Uvwiejitobor Akpevwe, Alfred Joseph and David Ukiri, all from Udu in Udu Local Government Area, were arraigned before the Chief Magistrate’s Court, Asaba, for electoral offences. The accused, who claimed to be vigilantes, were detailed by their local government chairman to escort electoral materials after sorting and sharing at the Delta State Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) during the postponed election. The acting state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Chuks Orisewezie, said in a statement in Asaba yesterday that their arraignment would serve as deterrent to would-be offenders. He said: “In the light of the above, a team of SAKCCS on the 7/2/2019 between 1600hrs and 1700hr, swung into action, tracked the suspect (Eluro) to his compound at Boji Boji Owa and arrested him with two others though not without resistance. “This is a warning signal to anybody who thinks he/she is above the law or can take the laws into his or her hand.” Orisewezie said the command was prepared to deal with any act of crime and criminality by any means legally possible.
