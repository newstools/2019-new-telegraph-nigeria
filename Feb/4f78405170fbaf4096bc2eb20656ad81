A Jos Upper Area Court 3 sitting in Kasuwan Nama on Tuesday granted one Hauwa Muhammed divorce due to her husbandâ€™s desertion. The Judge, Suleiman Lawal, granted the divorce to the petitioner with effect from Feb. 5, 2019. Earlier at the divorce proceedings, the petitioner had told the court that the respondent, Umar Abubakar, her husband, residing at Kwararafa in Jos North had eloped since Jan.18, 2019. The petitioner said that the marriage was blessed with six children and that she had been responsible for their up keep since he absconded. She said that the respondent had not contacted her since then and all efforts by her family as well as his family to find him had proved unsuccessful. She said that she was, therefore, at the court to seek the dissolution of her marriage to the respondent. (NAN)
