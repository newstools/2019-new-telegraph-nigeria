 Former Super Eagles striker Osaze Odemwingie has said most Nigerian players believe in native doctors to treat their injuries rather than seek orthodox medical practitioners’ help. The former West Brom of England star revealed he witnessed it first hand when he was taken to a native doctor when he broke his arm during his time in the Nigerian league. The former Super Eagles star, who was born in the old Soviet Union, returned to Nigeria to play briefly for amateur club AS Racines Lagos before transferring to Bendel Insurance, where he spent two years. ”I had a fall in training; I also hurt my shoulder and broke my arm. I was afraid to tell my mom so they took me to the local juju man,” Odemwingie told championat.com ”They poured hot water to relax the muscles. Somehow they returned the hand to the place, while I yelled, they twisted some small sticks. There was also a rite with a chicken. ”I came home, my mother saw the hand: “Broke?”. I answered: “Yes.” I was taken to a regular hospital, anaesthesia was done, and they put the plaster on. All was well in the end. ” Odemwingie said the problem was not limited to Nigerian footballers but most players in African believe juju men were more important than orthordox doctors. ”At least 70% of players believe in it. They think that some kind of salve will save them. It was some kind of brainwashing,” he said.
