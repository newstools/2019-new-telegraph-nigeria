Police at the weekend rescued three cattle breeders from kidnappers at Zungeru in Wushishi Local Government Area of Niger State after a gun duel.
The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mohammad Abubakar, said the kidnappers had attacked the cattle breeders along Rafia Daji village in Lapai Local Government Area while grazing.
The victims, Bello Abubakar, Buba Mohammed and Buba Gajere, the PPRO said, were rescued by a team of policemen attached to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Minna.
He said the kidnappers took their victims to undisclosed location and demanded N3 million as ransom.
Abubakar also disclosed that the SARS officials engaged the kidnappers in a gun duel which lasted for hours before they rescued the victims unhurt.
He said: “It was after the gun duel that the suspects fled to the bush with bullet wounds and abandoned one AK47 rifle with empty magazine.”
Abubakar advised the people against joining “these kidnappers that don’t mean well for the state or face the wrath of law.
“The command will not rest until the kidnappers are brought to book. They must leave kidnapping business otherwise the law will deal with them decisively.”
The PPRO also disclosed that investigation was ongoing and promised that the police would not relent until the fleeing suspects were apprehended.
