Gunmen have abducted a village head of Sabon Gida Bakin Koji in Lafia Local Government Area of Nasarawa State, Dauda Yakubu.
The kidnappers have reportedly demanded N5 million from family members of the traditional ruler. Witnesses said the five AK 47-wielding men stormed the residence of the village head about 11p.m. on Monday and took the monarch away. The state acting Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Ismail Usman, told journalists on the telephone that the Commissioner of Police, Bola Longe, had swiftly mobilised a team of security personnel comprised of police, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), the Department of State Services (DSS) and hunters to the area to hunt for the kidnappers. The PPRO explained that the team was already combing the neighbourhood to rescue the village head unhurt.
Usman, however, assured members of the public of the commandâ€™s commitment to rid the state of criminal elements to guaranty security of lives and property.
