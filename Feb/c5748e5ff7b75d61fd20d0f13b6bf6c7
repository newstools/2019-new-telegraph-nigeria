A 38-year-old motorcycle operator, Kunmi Adeyemi, who allegedly raped a 19-year-old girl, was on Monday remanded in Kirikiri Prisons by an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos State. The Magistrate, Mr P. E. Nwaka, while remanding Adeyemi, ordered that the case file should be sent to the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for advice. Nwaka adjourned the case until March 11 for the DPP’s advice. The plea of the defendant was not taken by the court. The accused, who resides at No. 7, Olowoporoku St., Mafoluku, Oshodi, Lagos, is being tried for rape. The Prosecutor, Insp. Christopher John, told the court that Adeyemi committed the offence on Jan. 28 at 3:00 p.m. in his residence. John said that the defendant unlawfully had sexual intercourse with the girl without her consent. He alleged that the victim was returning back from work and due to the rainfall, she tried to get shielded away from the rain in front of the defendant’s house. According to the prosecutor, after sometime, Adeyemi saw her and offered her to enter his apartment for comfort, only to be raped. The alleged offence contravened Section 261 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. (NAN)
