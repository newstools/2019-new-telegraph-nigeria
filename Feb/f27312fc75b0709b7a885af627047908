A Niger state-based group, Niger Against Corruption, has alleged that Hon Abdullahi Garba may have compromised the judge handling the suit which will determine who will be the candidate of the APC for Kontagora Mariga Wushishi and Mashegu Federal Constituency. According to the group, Hon Garba boosted during a campaign rally in Wushishi LG that the case is not an issue because he had already bought over the judge. “After the primary election of the APC a lot of people went to court because they felt cheated by the outcome. “In Niger state there were some cases but none of the cases is as bad as the candidates fighting to represent their people at the House of Representatives . “Among those facing challenges in court is Hon. Abdullahi Idris Garba popularly known as Mai Sola representing Kontagora Mariga Wushishi and Mashegu Fed. Constituency. “This man despite losing in the primaries as the people are already tired of his woeful representation had his mandate challenged in court but instead of focusing on the legal work before him, he went about compromising the judges. “He even had the audacity to openly tell his supporters in Wushishi LG during his campaign that the case he has in court is not an issue because he had already bought over  the judge. “We hope that the people will take note and shame the judge for betraying his/her professional ethics. But most importantly Nigerlites need to wake up and force these dishonorable Honorables out of power. A man who bribes a judge and openly brags about it is not fit to represent his people in any way,” the group stated.
