Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in Ogun State, Senator Buruji Kashamu, has urged the party’s National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, to stop misleading the electorate in the state.  Kashamu, who was reacting to a letter written by Secondus and the party’s National Secretary, Senator Ibrahim Umaru Tsauri to INEC, asking the electoral body to recognise Hon. Ladi Adebutu, as the party’s governorship candidate, said the letter was a tissue of lies, meant to blackmail INEC, insisting that the ploy would fail. Kashamu, in a February 4, 2019 letter entitled; “Re: Final List of Nominated Candidates in Ogun State” and addressed to the National Chairman, accused Secondus of twisting facts with a view to blackmailing INEC.  According to him, Secondus’ letter ‘drips with the usual lies and blackmail that you have always peddled to obfuscate obvious facts and issues that are glaringly in the public domain.’  He added; “Ordinarily, I would not have responded since the commission is aware of the issues and has the benefit of sound legal advice from senior lawyers and experts.  However, since you are not tired of telling lies, I would also not be tired of telling the truth and exposing your lies to the whole world.” Going into the genesis of the crisis, Kashamu said: “The indubitable fact is that the Federal High Court sitting in Lagos had on the 24th of June, 2016, delivered a judgement in which it directed the PDP and INEC to deal exclusively with the Engr. Adebayo Dayo-led Ogun State PDP executive.”
