This year’s valentine fell on a week day and most people will be in their work places all day and only have time in the evening to hangout. Making Valentine plans on a weekday can come with a lot of stress, especially when you have a 9 to 5 job.  So if you have a romantic date with your loved one after working hours and wouldn’t also want to look too dressed up at work during the day, check out these trendy work clothes that will still fit perfectly into your 9 to 5 job and still look great for a romantic dinner with your significant other.  Grab a simple dinner wear from your wardrobe that is less busy or frivolous. You can go for a bodycon dress, skirt and cute little top or one piece jumpsuit.  It’s all about anything that makes you feel comfortable. Pair your dress with minimal heels and keep your makeup soft and simple.  You can also add a pop of red to your overall ensemble to keep abreast with the spirit of Valentine Day and just set out to have fun with the one you love. Happy Valentine everyone and may love find you!
