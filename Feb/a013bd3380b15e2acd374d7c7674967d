National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) at the weekend in Kaduna donated relief materials to the victims of the Kajuru attacks in Kaduna State. The North-West Zonal Coordinator of NEMA, Mr. Isaiah Chinoko, who handed over the materials to the Chairman of the Distribution Committee of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) Camp, Malam Sabo Bayero, charged him to distribute the materials to the victims adequately. He said: “The gesture is not compensation for the loss of lives and property but a token to cushion the effects of the crisis on the people.” Chinoko said that the IDPs were in two separate locations at Crossing and Kajuru Junction. He said: “You must try on your part to tolerate one another and assist government in finding lasting solution to the unfortunate attack in your communities.” Some of the items distributed to the victims included 100 bags of rice, 50 bags of maize, 50 cartons of tomato paste, 50 bags of sugar, 500 pieces of nylon mat, blankets and mattresses. Others were 100 pots, 100 bags of detergent, 50 cartons of toilet soap, 500 mosquito nets, men, women and children’s clothing. Chinoko condoled with the Kaduna State government and its people over the loss of lives and property, arising from the crisis. Receiving the items, Bayero thanked NEMA for the donation, saying that the agency’s response was an indication that Nigeria had a caring government. He said that with tolerance and peace, there would have been no need for the relief materials, tasking them to stay together as one. Bayero told the management of NEMA that a committee had been set up to ensure that the materials reached the actual persons affected by the attacks.
