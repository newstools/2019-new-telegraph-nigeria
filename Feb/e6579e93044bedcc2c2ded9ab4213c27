 The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said only few political parties have submitted names of their agents, less than a week to the presidential election.
Also, the Commission said most of the lists submitted were not accompanied by the photographs and specimen signatures of the poll agents as required by law.  A statement issued at the end of meeting with Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) on Friday, INEC expressed concern that a week after the deadline for the submission of the list of poll agents for Presidential and National Assembly elections and less than three weeks to the deadline for the submission of the list of candidates for the Governorship and State Assembly elections, only few political parties have complied with the extant provisions of the law.  The statement, which was signed by Festus Okoye, National Commissioner in Charge of Information and Voter Education Committee noted that according to its timetable and schedule of activities for this year’s general elections February 1 as the last date for the submission of the names, two passport photographs of each polling agent and their sample signatures for the presidential and National Assembly Elections and February 16, 2019.  It therefore requested political parties that submitted “incomplete applications without the specimen signatures and photographs of the poll/party agents” to regularize this on or before close of work on Monday, February 11.  The statement further said: “All political parties are reminded that February 16, 2019 is the last day for the submission of the names, photographs and specimen signatures of poll/party agents for the Governorship, State Assembly and Area Council elections.  “Any list of poll/party agents that is not accompanied by specimen signatures and photographs of poll/party agents will be rejected.”  The statement reminded political parties that it is unlawful to deploy poll/party agents whose names have not been forwarded to the commission and duly accredited in accordance with the law. It stated that security agents have been informed not to accord recognition, right or privilege to anyone not accredited by the commission.
