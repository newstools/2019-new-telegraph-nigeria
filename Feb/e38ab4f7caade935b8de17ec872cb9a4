The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) has commended security and party agents for their cooperation with the commission during the Saturday’s polls. In an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, the Head of Department, Voter Education and Publicity, Mr Ndidi Okafor described the security agents as “professionals.” “Honestly, I will like to commend security agents and the party agents, they have been wonderful and you also know it, I do not know, did any security agent challenge you as a journalist? No! “They have been thoroughly trained and they did their jobs professionally and we are very grateful indeed to all of them; great Nigerians they are, we are grateful,’’ she said. Okafor said that collation of results of the just concluded presidential and the National Assembly elections for the Abuja City Centre Ward was ongoing. She said that the ward collation officers were busy carrying out integrity checks and cross checking of the results, calling for more time for the officers do a diligent job. Okafor acknowledged that the commission experienced some challenges at the polls but were quickly resolved to allow free flow of the process. “Basically, we had technical issues with the card readers in some of the polling units but they were quickly addressed. “The bulk of all that we discovered later was as a result of pressure; the good people of the FCT came out en mass, everyone wanted to vote so you have that pressure on the corps members. “Sometimes they forget what they already know but those were quickly resolved and the card readers were used,’’ she said.
