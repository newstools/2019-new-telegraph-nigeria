Former Super Eagles midfielder, Garba Lawal, has picked positives from Flying Eagles’ performances at the just concluded Africa U-20 Cup of Nations, saying the squad learnt valuable lessons in Niger Republic. Although Paul Aigbogun’s side fell to Mali in the semifinals and lost to South Africa in Saturday’s third-place match, Lawal is of the view that the coach and his wards have useful tips to build on heading into the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Poland. Lawal admitted it was a disappointing for the Flying Eagles not being able to reach the AFCON U-20 final, but recounted how Aigbogun had stated even before the competition began that his priority was the World Cup ticket. “It is a disappointment that they could not get to the final,” Lawal told New Telegraph. “But I remember that the coach said his target was the World Cup. “He must have been thinking more of the World Cup than the African championship, so now he has qualified for the World Cup. “That is not to say he lost everything at the African championship in Niger Republic; because a coach should learn from every match.
“I am sure he and his players have learnt from this championship, so we want to see what they can do at the World Cup finally.”
