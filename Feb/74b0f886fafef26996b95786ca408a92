 Erstwhile Super Eagles forward Victor Moses has suggested he missed playing for the national team less than nine months after he announced his international retirement.
Moses shockingly announced his decision to quit the Super Eagles shortly after the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.
The former Wigan Athletic winger, while relishing his time at his new club Fernebahce of Turkey, likened the atmosphere at the outfit’s stadium with what usually prevail in the Nigerian national team.
He said the electric attitude of the Fernebahce’s fans made him feel nostalgic about his time with the Eagles.
Moses said: “I feel love here and the fans are really pushing me. Not so different like when I play for Nigeria.
“I miss playing for Nigeria as making the fans happy is our goal as a team. Same as here with Fenerbahce.”
