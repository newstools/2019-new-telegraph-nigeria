Suspected criminals arrested by the police in Niger State have said that kidnapping was lucrative and made them to “swim in money”. The suspects, Mohammed Abubakar (25), Mamuda Mohammed (30), Mohammed Mohammed (26) and Amadu Garba (21), were trailed and arrested by police detectives attached to Lapai Police Division. Before their arrest, the suspects have been terrorising Fota village in Lapai Local Government Area. Narrating their exploits, one of the suspects, Mamuda Mohammed, told our correspondent that kidnapping was lucrative and it was their sole business in the area. He said: “We have been making a lot of money from our victims whenever we kidnapped them. The ransom was quite rewarding to an extent that we can compare ourselves with directors in the state ministries. “We swim in cash, marry more wives and lavish money on our girlfriends. Honestly we never knew that our cups will come to the brim until we found ourselves in the police net.” It was learnt that the suspects kidnapped a man, Sani Dukuma, of Fota village, Lapai, who later escaped from them before they were apprehended on a tip-off. The suspects had earlier kidnapped the father of their victim and collected N1.5 million ransom before his release. The suspects, it was also learnt, have been making life unbearable for the entire village of Fota in the past two years. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Muhammad Abubakar, confirmed the arrest yesterday. He said the matter was reported to the police on January 13. Abubakar said the suspects had admitted to committing the offence, adding that the matter had been charged to court.
