President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday expressed disappointment with the decision of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in postponing the presidential and National Assembly election scheduled for February 16. The President has returned to the presidential villa, Abuja, from his home town Daura, Katsina state, where he traveled to cast his ballot.  Senior Special Assistant on media and publicity to the President, Garba Shehu, in a statement said Buhari was surprised that INEC would go the way of postponement after given the Federal Government and all stakeholders the assurances that it was fully prepared to deliver a free, fair and credible election.  According to Garba, President Buhari said: “I am deeply disappointed that despite the long notice given and our preparations both locally and internationally, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) postponed the Presidential and National Assembly elections within hours of its commencement.”   The President lamented that it was worrisome that many Nigerians were thrown into hardship after having traveled long distances to participate in the election, only to be left stranded.  He said: “Many Nigerians have traveled to various locations to exercise their rights to vote, and international observers are gathered. “INEC themselves have given assurances, day after day and almost hour after hour that they are in complete readiness for the elections. We and all our citizens believed them.”
