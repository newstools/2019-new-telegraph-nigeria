When it comes to relationships and love, Nigerian celebrities have a way of showing who and what matters to them. Stunning actress, Toyin Abraham has shared a thing about her relationship life on social media. In a recent Instagram exchange, she told a fan that she is contented and hardworking and only dates people for love and not money.  It all started when the actress showed her support for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. The fan had suggested that Toyin clearly had something for the VP and she must like rich men and not those who struggle or are still trying to make their mark in the world.  She immediately responded stating that she does not date for money and the fan can ask other people about her if they so wish. According to her, “I don’t date for money. Ask around, I date for love and I’m hardworking and contented”. Recall that Abraham was engaged to be married to a senor lawyer last year but things reportedly got called off after a few months of their engagement.  Although Toyin has not explicitly stated that she is ready to mingle, it is clear that the talented actress is hoping to find a special someone soon. Toyin was formerly married to Nollywood actor, Niyi Johnson who is now married to another woman.
