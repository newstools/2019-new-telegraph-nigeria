 An Ilorin High Court trying five accused people connected with the April 5, 2018 robbery in Offa, Kwara State has adjourned the matter till March 14 and 15. This followed the absence of the defence counsel, Mathias Emeribe, who said he was having “life threatening experiences on the road”. His argument was made known to the court at the resumed hearing of the case yesterday through the prosecution counsel, Prof Wahab Egbewole.
Egbewole told the court, presided over by Justice Halima Saleeman, that he got a call and also received a text message from Emeribe, asking for an adjournment of the case based on his ‘experience’. Although the court granted the request, Justice Saleeman noted it was done reluctantly as she expressed disappointment over the absence of the defence counsel in court.
The judge said that the prosecution counsel should have asked for details of the “life threatening experience” of the defence counsel. She said: “Does it mean that he won’t step out of his room till after the national elections? I can’t fathom this excuse and explanation, for someone to sit in the comfort of his house and be sending text messages. This court is only interested in timely disposition of the matter and any delay could put the court in jeopardy.” The hearing, which had been slated to hold between February 19 and 20, involves five people – Ayoade Akinnibosun, Ibikunle Ogunleye, Adeola Abraham, Salaudeen Azeez and Niyi Ogundiran – all of who were brought to court yesterday.
Speaking with journalists after the court sitting, Egbewole said that the defence counsel called him on Sunday and also sent a text message to him on yesterday that he could not be in court yesterday and suggested a date after the national elections.
