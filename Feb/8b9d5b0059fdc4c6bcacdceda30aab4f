The Nigerian High Commissioner to India, Maj.-Gen. Chris Eze (rtd.), has described the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB)’s sit-at-home order during today’s general elections as counterproductive. Eze said on Thursday in Enugu, that no sensible Igbo man should obey such a silly order, adding that it was a way of distracting some ignorant people from exercising their franchise. The envoy, who said Ralph Uwazurike came up with MASSOB in 2006 and prevented Igbos from being counted in the census, said the statistics compiled in 2006 put Igbos where they are today. He said: “If the Igbos know what is good for them, they should not listen to IPOB; they should re-integrate themselves into the national main stream like they did in 1979.” Eze said looking at the world now, strategically speaking, it is more about consolidation rather than segmentation, noting that whatever IPOB based the decision to boycott the election on could not be in the interest of the South-East. The high commissioner, while urging the people of Enugu State to rejoice as this was the first time since 1999 that they had an alternative platform, said Enugu had been practicing almost one party system.
