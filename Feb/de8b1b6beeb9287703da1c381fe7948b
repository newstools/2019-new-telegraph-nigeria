Chief Coach of Nigeria’s U-23 team, Imama Amapakabo, is sure that his squad will beat their Libya counterparts in the back-to-back Africa Cup of Nations qualifier next month. The former Rangers of Enugu coach said this after his side played a goalless draw with SiaOne Academy at the National Stadium training pitch in Abuja at weekend. He expressed satisfaction with the performance of the team just as he disclosed many players would be dropped for not meeting the standard. Amapakabo told reporters that the players who could not convince the technical crew on what they could bring to the team has been dropped and added that many will still follow them out as the search for the best continues. “We have started the real business, we have allowed some players to go who couldn’t meet up the pace and as well what we is needed in the camp,” “More players will still go because we don’t have much time on our side, it going to be substitution by elimination.” Imama said. He explained that the friendly match with the SiaOne Academy was an opportunity to see some of the lads. “We had to try a whole lot of players because we are still trying to see how they will blend with our system. “This was an opportunity to give every invited player a chance to play. We have done some tactical work in them and we are trying to see how well they will be able to show the work in training,” he noted. He rued his side’s proficiency in front of goal, insisting they could have scored some goals if they had been clinical in the final third. “Certainly, I’m satisfied with their overall play, despite the fact that the goals did not come. It was unfortunate not to come despite creating lots of chances; hopefully, we will improve on that,” Imama added.
