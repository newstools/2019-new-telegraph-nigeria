An anti-corruption group, Bauchi Civil Society Organization Network, has praised the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for fast-track the trial and prosecution of Bauchi state governor-elect, Alhaji Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed. In a letter made available to newsmen, Comrade Hussein Mohammed, the Coordinator of the anti-corruption group said EFCC under the leadership of Ibrahim Magu is reputed for going after politically exposed persons who have squandered the hard-earned resources of this country. The statement reads in part; “It is in this wise that we a coalition of local civil society organisations based in Bauchi State, have decided to commend the latest effort of the commission to fast-track the trial and prosecution of Alhaji Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed, who is gradually itching closer to robing himself with the cloak of immunity in order to escape from justice. “We also note with appreciation, the refusal of the EFCC to pander to some sponsored fabrications to suspend the multi-billion-naira corruption trial of Bala Mohammed, on the puerile ground that he is now a governor-elect.  Immunity from criminal prosecution cannot be extended to a governor-elect. “We make bold to say that your commission is obligated to making this a test case by ensuring a day to day trial in line with the administration of criminal justice act and also make it a water-shed prosecution before May 29, 2019, to serve as a deterrent to corrupt politicians that before immunity comes justice. “You will recall that since Alhaji Bala Mohammed was suspected by your commission to have received bribes and committed economic crimes involving up to N1.6 trillion in questionable land allocations, he has been doing everything to hide from prosecution. “Therefore, your commission cannot afford to allow this egregious crime to go unpunished.
