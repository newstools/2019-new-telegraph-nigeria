Kano State Commissioner for Rural Development, Musa Illiyasu Kwankwaso, yesterday went down memory lane on how he drafted former Governor Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso into politics, when he was serving as a deputy director at the state Water Resources Board. Illiyasu, who reminded the people that politically, he was Kwankwaso boss, said he ensured his participation in politics despite all odds.  The commissioner noted that while Kwankwaso was at the water board and another political dispensation was around, he said he personally insisted that Kwankwaso had to join partisan politics.  “That time, we were actively involved in politics and I as youth leader had a say on what happens, and when I brought Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso   around, there was a serious debate on who he was.” Illiyasu noted, however, that because of my political influence, I made him to contest for House of Representatives’ seat and he won.”  Illiyasu said in all the elections that were conducted, they had never had a genuine, free and fair election while Kwankwaso reigns. He said all the elections were manipulated by Kwankwaso and numbers were just gathered and allocated to people.  “Even this last election, hundreds of foreigners from Kaduna and other places were brought into Madobi by Kwankwaso to perpetrate rigging, but as God would have it, true indigenous Madobi peoples stood their grounds against it.” Illiyasu lamented how today, Kwankwaso played his politics, saying he had truly derailed from what he was taught.
