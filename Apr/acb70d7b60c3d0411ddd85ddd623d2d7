Senegal football legend, El-Hadji Diouf, has rated the Super Eagles among his topthree favourites to win this year’s Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, but places the three-time champions behind Egypt and Morocco. While affirming his belief that Egypt stand the best chance of winning the trophy, due to home advantage and the presence of Liverpool ace, Mohamed Salah, in their squad, Diouf is not ruling out Nigeria. The 2001 and 2002 African Footballer of the Year, who made top marks with Liverpool as well in his heyday, said he would have loved to see his country, Senegal, carry the day, but opined that Egypt, Morocco and Nigeria have greater potential than The Teranga Lions. The 38-year-old Senegalese icon added in his projections for this year’s AFCON that The Pharaohs have the edge over his own country, because he believes t h e host nation will have bigger support than all other sides. ‘The Serial Killer,’ who won some silverware with Liverpool and Glasgow Rangers of Scotland, was part of the 2002 Senegal side that impressed in the World Cup and made it to the final of the AFCON in Mali same year, further stressed that his former club’s star, Salah, will also help Egypt. Diouf stated: “I would put Senegal at the top because it is my country and I hope they win the title but there are many other good teams – Egypt will be at the forefront with Morocco and Nigeria. “Egypt is the strongest candidate for me because they will play in their own country with a lot of fans. “They have very good players led by Mohamed Salah. He’s a very decisive player and has a full country behind him.”
