As Nigerians expect implementation of the N30,000 minimum wage, the Managing Director of Moahz Oil and Gas has called on the government at all levels and private organizations to prioritise training and development of workers across the state. According to him, beyond development of the nation’s economy, deliberate investment in the personal development of employees also guarantees organisational growth. Speaking with Saturday Telegraph on the imperative of employee development, Ojo advocated that employees should be given the opportunities to explore, saying the nation enjoys rapid growth if its workforce are well trained. He said: “We need to take the internal promotion of employees very seriously as much as we pay heavily on external promotions. “As an employer at Moahz Oil and Gas, I take it upon myself to give room for the personal development of our employees. Allow them to explore opportunities. Don’t restrict, though you try to focus on your area of specialty. “This philosophy is informed by our determination to recruit and reward a high-quality workforce in a competitive economy by creating an environment that supports professionalism, integrity and innovation.”
