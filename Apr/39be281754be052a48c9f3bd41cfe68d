Operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) yesterday were accused of killing a fan of an English Premiership League club, Liverpool, at Olu Aboderin Street, Onipetesi area of Lagos State. The incident was said to have occurred at noon while the young boy was watching a football match involving Liverpool and Tottenham. He was believed to have been hit by a stray bullet. However, the officer charge of SARS debunked the allegation, stressing that his men were not at that axis for any operation. But a source from SARS office, police headquarters Ikeja, alleged that the killer bullet was fired by one of the operatives of Anti-Cultism Unit. A witness said the deceased was watching the match when the bullet hit him. One of the witnesses, Emenike, said: “The officers had come to the area to arrest a guy, who was spotting dreadlocks. The policemen started shooting sporadically after enforcing the arrest. One of the bullets hit the victim. The victim was rushed to the Ikeja General Hospital, where he was confirmed dead.” The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Bala Elkana, could not be reached on his mobile line for confirmation.
