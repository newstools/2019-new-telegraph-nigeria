The cause of the fire is yet unknown, but it was said to have started at about 2p.m. and raged for almost an hour. It however took the intervention of fire fighter and airport workers to put out the fire. When the fire started, there was panic and many travellers scampered in different directions, creating chaos.   There was almost a stampede. A source, which described the fire as mysterious, added: “It happened at the arrival section of the airport where some renovation works were being executed by the airport authorities. It would have caused a huge damage but for the arrival of fire fighters. The fire started at 2:10p.m. and raged on for about 50 minutes. It damaged equipment and infrastructure. I do not think the damage will affect flight operations at the airport.”  The Imo State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Orlando Ikeokwu, when contacted, said that he was yet to be formerly briefed on the fire outbreak.
