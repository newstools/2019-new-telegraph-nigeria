 Despite its poor response to insurance matters, especially with regard to premium, the Federal Government has earmarked about N175.19 million as premium for the country’s foreign missions.
Findings by New Telegraph revealed that the amount covers both active and inactive centres cutting across 107 locations. The appropriation is also coming when the Federal Government is yet to come clear on its decision to close at least five of such missions that were considered inactive and wasteful.
According to a breakdown of the premium, information on United Kingdom and Czech Republic remain missing, just as the least amount of N5,109 was earmarked for Kingston, Jamaica.
Last year, the Federal Government announced that it would be closing down at least five of its embassies and foreign missions.
Foreign Affairs Minister, Geoffrey Onyema, had said that the process of closure was underway and his ministry was waiting for the approval of the president.
He, however, did not disclose the names of the affected embassies.
“We do not want to indicate the embassies that will be closed yet because we are in the process of submitting the proposals, the cost analysis and also the political analysis we did to the president,” the minister had said.
“When he sees that, he may or may not want to close some, so we have not yet reached the stage of closing some.

Despite the appropriation, it would be recalled that insurance operators had often faulted Federal Government over its poor response to insurance renewals for civil servants under the group life policy.
Series of events in the past had revealed the unwillingness of the Federal Government to fund insurance cover for public servants, thereby denying them or their family members any form of compensation in the event of an incident.
