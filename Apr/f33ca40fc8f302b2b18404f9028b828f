Irate youths have killed and burnt two suspected robbers at Akerior village in Ushongo Local Government Area of Benue State. The incident occurred about 9.33p.m., on Wednesday when the yet-to-be-identified thieves went with arms to rob an Igbo trader popularly known as CK in the area. The mob action followed a series of robbery attacks on residents of the settlement, particularly Igbo traders. Witnesses said the three suspects rode on a Bajaj motorcycle. Two were caught while one escaped. The robbers shot sporadically into the air to scare residents during the robbery. But youths quickly mobilised and apprehended two of them. A locally-made automatic rifle with rounds of ammunition was recovered from them and handed over to the police. The matter was reported to the Divisional Police Officer at Ushongo who visited the scene early yesterday and collected the rifle and the ammunition. The District Head of Utange, Chief Kase Audu, with kindred heads of Nyav, Chief Mvaaorga Ubo and Shuav, Gumba Iorer Francis also visited the scene.
