The National Assembly, yesterday, in an attempt to end public outcry over the secrecy of its budget, released the details of its N139.5 billion 2018 budget profile. The release of the budget details was in keeping with the directive given to that effect last month by the President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki. Saraki had in a letter dated March 26, directed the Clerk to the National Assembly, Mohammed Sani-Omolori, to put in the public domain, details of the N139.5 billion 2018 budget of the National Assembly. The letter entitled: “NASS Budget Details” and signed by the Chief of Staff to the Senate President, Dr. Hakeem Baba- Ahmed, reads : “The President of the Senate has asked me to request you to please ensure that the NASS budget details with all the line items are ready for passage along with the National Budget when Senate resumes next week.” However, the details released yesterday through the twitter handle of the Clerk are those of the 2018 budget allocations. Under the personnel component of the budget, Senate has N1.8 billion, House of Representatives, N4.9 billion, National Assembly Service Commission, N1.17 billion and Legislative Aides, N9.5 billion.
