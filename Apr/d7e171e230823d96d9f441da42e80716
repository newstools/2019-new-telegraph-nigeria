X3M Music act, Simi, has shared the album cover of her forthcoming third studio album, Omo Charlie Champagne, with her fans. From all indications, the newly married Simi, who posted the cover via her Instagram account on Tuesday, can’t wait to have the album released.
“Guys, is it doing you like you should preorder something incredible? Look at her cute little cheeks. Don’t tell her no. #OmoCharlieChampagne,” she wrote along with the album cover.
The “Jamb Question” singer announced last month that she would be releasing her album, which will feature the likes of Falz, Adekunle Gold, Patoranking and Maleek Berry, on her birthday.
Simi, who released Simisola, her second album in 2017, which went on to enjoy mainstream success, is back for another round. Her last album was the first album to hit the 1million mark on streaming platform, Boomplay.
