A policeman attached to Omu-Aran Police Division in Kwara State, who was attacked by a suspected madman, has died. The deceased, identified simply as Sergeant Abu, was said to be on the premises of the police station when he was attacked on Tuesday afternoon. The assailant, who was armed with a machete and other dangerous weapons, was said to be showing signs of insanity before the attack.  The attacker was said to be a scavenger. The deceased was said to have been rushed to a private hospital in the town, but was later transferred to Ido Medical Centre in Ekiti State where he died yesterday.  The assailant, who hails from Aran-Orin, was said to have first approached the station with a shovel and a wooden stick, but was disarmed. He was said to have later returned to the station where he attacked the deceased. A witness told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that it took the combined efforts of some commercial motorcyclists and a police patrol team before the assailant, who took to his heels after the attack, could be apprehended at the Taiwo area of the town.  “I was on my motorcycle when I saw the fleeing man holding a cutlass (machete) and a wood. “He was wearing a red attire and we followed him. Later, some other motorcyclists joined in the chase and on getting to Taiwo area, he stopped, dropped his weapons and raised up his hands. “It was in the process that he was arrested by the police and moved to the station,” the witness, who preferred anonymity, said.  The atmosphere in the police command was tense yesterday afternoon when a NAN correspondent visited as the policemen were still in shock following the death of their colleague. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Ajayi Okasanmi, confirmed the incident. Okasanmi said investigation into the case was being carried out in collaboration with the Divisional Police Officer in Omu- Aran.
