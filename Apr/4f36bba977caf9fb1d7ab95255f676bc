The tough economic environment in the country, last year, may not have negatively impacted Deposit Money Banks’ (DMBs) quest to attract deposits, as eight lenders increased their total customer deposits from N13.6 trillion that they reported in 2017 to N15.4 trillion last year. The eight lenders that have so far released their Full Year 2018 results, which New Telegraph analysed are Zenith Bank, United Bank for Africa (UBA), Access Bank, Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) and Fidelity Bank. Others are FCMB, Stanbic IBTC and Sterling Bank. A breakdown of the results indicate that Tier 1 banks remain dominant in the industry as their customer deposits are in trillions compared with Tier 2 banks that are yet to hit that mark. For instance, Tier 1 lender, Zenith Bank led the pack, as it reported that its customer deposits increased by 7.34 per cent to N3.69 trillion last year compared with N3.44 trillion it recorded in the same period of 2017. It was followed by UBA, which garnered customer deposits of N3.52 trillion last year, indicating an increase of 22.89 per cent over the N2.87 trillion the Tier 1 lender reported for the same period in the previous year. Similarly, Access Bank posted customer deposits of N2.56 trillion in 2018, showing an increase of 14.26 per cent over the N2.24 trillion recorded by the lender in the previous year. Another Tier 1 lender, GTB, also reported customer deposits of N2.27 trillion for last year, which was an increase of 10.27 per cent over the N2.06 trillion it recorded for 2017. Leading Tier 2 lender, Fidelity Bank came close to the trillion naira mark, as it reported customer deposits of N979 billion last year, an increase of 26.33 per cent over the N775 billion, it posted for 2017. It was trailed by FCMB, which reported customer deposits of N821.7 billion in 2018, an increase of 19 per cent over the N689.9 billion, the Tier 2 lender recorded in the previous year. Stanbic IBTC posted a 7 per cent increase in customer deposits last year to N807.7 billion from the N753.6 billion, which it reported for 2017. Sterling Bank equally reported an increase (about 11 per cent) in customer deposits to N760.61 billion in 2018 from the N684.83 billion the Tier 2 lender posted for the same period of the previous year. In its Financial Stability Report as at the end of June 2017, released last year, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had disclosed that six of the largest banks in the country accounted for 57.05 per cent of the total deposits in the industry as at June 2017, compared with the 53.70 per cent recorded at the end of December 2016. The report stated that the six banks also accounted for 60.11 per cent of total industry assets, as against the 53.68 per cent recorded at end-December 2016. This, according to the report, highlighted the oligopolistic market structure of the banking industry, with few banks controlling more than 50 per cent of the industry deposits and assets. However, the study stated that the low concentration ratios in the industry showed a trend towards more competition across the banks. “The market share of the largest bank with respect to deposits and assets stood at 12.93 and 14.79 per cent, respectively, while that of the second largest bank stood at 12.88 and 11.72 per cent,” said the study. “Twenty-three other banks had market shares ranging from 0.02 to 9.01 per cent in deposits and 0.08 to 9.96 per cent in assets.” Speculation had been rife in industry circles that lenders would struggle to mobilise deposits from individuals, as a lot of depositors were increasingly shunning banks’ low interest savings accounts for more attractive treasury bills’ yields.Analysts point out that FY 2018 financial results so far released by banks indicate that most lenders have been able to devise effective deposit mobilisation strategies, which enabled them to sustain deposit growth last year despite the challenges they faced. Indeed, the competition for customer deposits pushed many banks into launching new saving deposits mobilisation campaigns or refreshing their retail products to make them attractive to customers. In a recent report, Afrinvest Securities Limited had stated that with the increased focus on the retail segment: “The future of banking is set to take a dramatic turn. “We believe banks will begin to specialise in specific areas of business to ensure they compete effectively in the new banking landscape. While most banks are hinged on product differentiation strategies using innovation to remain afloat, we keep a keen watch on the industry’s competitiveness as events unfold.” The impending combination of the operations of Access and Diamond banks is set to sharpen competition for customer deposits especially among Tier 1 lenders.
