Rangers forward, Ifeanyi Egwin, was in cloud nine as he finally returned to action after fracturing his leg on the final day of the 2016 Nigeria Professional Football League season where the club ended a 32-year wait for the league title.
Egwin came in as a late substitute in the 2-1 win on the road for the Enugu side over Kwara United in Ilorin and was full of thanks to the management of the club and government of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, who stood by him in the period the injury lasted.
“Sincerely, I am a very happy person as I started playing competitive football again for my club Rangers and capping the appearance with our first away win of the season,” he said.
“I really thank God who made it all possible just as I won’t fail to express my thanks to the governor of Enugu State, for his show of love and care since I broke my leg.
“I can’t forget to thank Nigeria football followers for their prayers and show of love during my trial period. It can only get better as I hope to contribute my quota towards achieving the target of the team this season.”
The former Rivers United attacking sensation broke his leg in the final match of the 2016 NPFL season against El-Kanemi Warriors in a 4-0 rout at ‘The Cathedral’, Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, Enugu, with the executive governor of Enugu state present at the VVIP stand on October 2, 2016 when Rangers broke a 32-year wait for the league diadem.
