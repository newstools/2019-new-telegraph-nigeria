A Civil Society Organization, African Initiative Against Corruption and Examination Malpractice (AFICEM) yesterday staged a protest at the National Youth Service Corps’ (NYSC) state secretariat, demanding immediate review of nominees from Imo for the NYSC presidential merit award list slated for Friday. The group, which threatened showdown with NYSC, faulted the list from Imo and accused the commission of compromise. Also, the CSO argued that the duo shortlisted had no meaningful CDS projects that would be attributed to their name, while also saying that the commission omitted names of those who emerged overall best in 2015 and 2016.  The Presidential merit award for NYSC corps members who served between 2015 and 2017 had been slated for Friday. However, addressing top officials of NYSC during the protest, Dr. Francis Abiaye, national coordinator of the AFICEM faulted the nomination and challenged NYSC to show the CDS projects executed by the duo.  He argued that Mr. Matthew Ajibola, who emerged overall best corps’ member of Batch A in 2015 after constructing eight rooms ultramodern tourism toilet and biogas digester facility at the Imo state zoological garden should have made the list on merit. He said the overall best corps’ member in Batch A 2016, Mr. Ademola Sunday who constructed a modern fish pond and carried out major rehabilitation work during his service year should have also made the list.  “The list of proposed Community Development Project awardees whose selection process was expected to be purely on merit has allegedly been spiced with bias and corruption.  “The integrity of the list has left many questions for the nominating committee to answer and we are here to demand to see the projects executed by the two nominees from Imo and also call for urgent review of the list”, he said.
