Asked to comment on the efforts of the present administration in tackling security challenges in the country, Mutallab said: “Well, I think they are trying their best. “We need the corporation of all of us to solve security challenges. We have to give information to the security agencies so that they can nip the security threats in the bud before they occur. I believe that is what the citizens should do.” He also spoke on the security challenges facing in Katsina State, as he said it was a phase that would soon pass away. Speaking on it, he said: “We hope that the security situation in Katsina is a short time thing, the government is doing everything to attend to it.
