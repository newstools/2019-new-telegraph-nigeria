Police have arrested a teacher, simply identified as Gbadebo, for allegedly defiling two minors at a popular private school at Akute area of Ogun State. It was learnt that when the incident occurred, the management of the school allegedly sacked the teacher instead of reporting the matter to the police.  But Gbadebo was arrested when the victims’ parents reported the matter to Ajuwon Police Station. The suspect was said to have defiled two girls aged six and nine. He was accused by one of the pupils of molesting her for over three years. When the matter was brought to the notice of the head teacher, she allegedly threatened to deal with them if they informed anyone about the incident.   It was learnt that when the pupils were taken to hospital for medical examination, one of the pupils was diagnosed with severe condition as her anal nerve was said to have been damaged.  The pupil was said to be urinating and defecating uncontrollably as a result of the damage from the defilement.  When our correspondent visited the school yesterday, the teachers refused to comment on the matter. When contacted on the phone, two of the parents said they were at the police station and couldn’t comment on the matter, especially since it was already under investigation. However, the state Police Public Relations Officer, (PPRO), SP Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed Gbadebo’s arrest. Oyeyemi said when the incident occurred the management of the school didn’t report the matter to the police.   He said: “What the school management did was to sack the teacher. It was when the parents of the pupils reported the matter to the police that the teacher was arrested. “The state Commissioner of Police, Bashir Makama, has directed that the matter be transferred to the State Criminal Investigations and Intelligence Department (SCIID) for proper investigation and prosecution.”
