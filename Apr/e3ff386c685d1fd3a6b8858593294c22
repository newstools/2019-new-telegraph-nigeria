Super Eagles midfielder, Oghenekaro Etebo, has been nominated for Stoke City Player of the Season award following his superb displays on his debut season with the Potters. Etebo who moved to Stoke from Portuguese outfit CD Feirense last season has been one of the standout performers for the club this season despite scoring just two goals in his 32 Championship appearances for club this season. The 24 year old Nigeria international scored his first goal for Stoke in their 2-0 home win against Nothingham Forest in March and his second early this month in the 1-0 away victory at Blackburn Rovers and has also scooped two man of the match awards this season.
