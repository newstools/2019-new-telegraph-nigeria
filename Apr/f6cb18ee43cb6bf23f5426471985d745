Gboyega Oyetola, the Governor of the State of Osun, has promised to complete the ongoing construction of the small hydroelectric power project initiated by his predecessor, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola located at Ikeji Ile in no distance time for the use of the two major towns (Ikeji Ile & Ipetu Ijesa) in Oriade local government. This was made known by the leader of the government delegation to the project site, the secretary to the state government, Prince Wole Oyebamiji, in his words, “One of the essence of continuity is what’s about unfolding, government is in continuum; and primarily the essence of every responsible government the world over is to bring security, peace and development to the people” And the present day government under the leadership of our amiable Governor, Gboyega Oyetola has promised to make life meaningful for all the citizens as the completion of this project, which is masses driven will bring development and more comfort to the people of this community, he added. The Supervisor for Works in the state, Engr. Remi Omowaiye showered encomium on the United Nations  Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) for their support and technical assistance thus far on the project, as he revealed that Governor Oyetola has gave a marching order for the completion of the Ikeji Ile Hydroelectric power project without delay, which in itself is a pilot scheme, to give birth to other dams which have the potential of generating more utilizable power for the use of the state such as the Owalla, Kajola dam. The primary initiative of this scheme is to support the generating capacity of the Buhari led Federal government to ensure steady and stable power supply, as the Owalla hydroelectric project in Egbedore LG when completed can be used to provide electricity for the entire complex of the government secretariat at Abeere which will enhance productivity of the workers for optimal performance. Omowaiye attested that this scheme is borne out of creativity and ingenuity on the part of the leadership of the state to make the little resources available deliver true governance to the nooks and crannies of Osun. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/0f1278cf-2af9-433a-a23c-2a8febc8d54a.jpg?resize=740%2C493&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="740" height="493" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-207275" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/0f1278cf-2af9-433a-a23c-2a8febc8d54a.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/0f1278cf-2af9-433a-a23c-2a8febc8d54a.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/0f1278cf-2af9-433a-a23c-2a8febc8d54a.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" data-recalc-dims="1"> Speaking further on the project, the coordinating director of the state ministry of works and transport, Engr.
