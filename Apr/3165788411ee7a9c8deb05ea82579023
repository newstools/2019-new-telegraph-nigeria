The fight to preserve and promote green environment has been on for years, with the impact of climate change driving home the need for people of the world to change their belief and use of the environment so as to avert the negative impact. Nowhere else is this more visible and pushed with vigour than in the travel industry where adherence to the green environment is promoted in different ways, especially in hospitality.
Travellers are consistently seeking accommodation that supports eco-friendly initiatives and here in Nigeria, Eko Hotels and Suites is taking the lead as the largest indigenous hotel brand to drive this cause by introducing environmentally conscious elements/attitude to running its operations.
According to the hotels’ management, “we see great opportunity in building capacity in an area that improves the personal welfare of guests, their families and our society more broadly. As part of the programmes and activities planned around the Eco-Friendly campaign, EKo Hotels and Suites will be hosting a painting contest.
The eco – friendly Children Painting Contest is a visual art contest that encourages students to create a piece of art inspired by nature that surrounds us, reflecting a society that encourages innovative and sustainable waste management, energy and Water conservation.
The main objectives of the art competition are: To help children develop a sense of respect and care for the natural environment and to express their thoughts and ideas about their environment; To raise awareness in schools about the importance of the natural environment and ways of preserving it; To demonstrate student’s knowledge about recycling and natural greenery of their communities; and To help students realise that each individual has a social responsibility to contribute to the protection and preservation of the environment
The visual arts challenge is open to selected secondary schools in Eti-Osa Local government in Lagos State between ages 12 and 15 of public and private schools.
Of the selected 20 participating schools, 10 will be shortlisted to partake in the grand finale. Shortlisted artists and their guardians will be treated to a two day all-expense paid, activity filled weekend at the hotel leading up to the contest date which falls on April 22 (Earth Day 2019).
