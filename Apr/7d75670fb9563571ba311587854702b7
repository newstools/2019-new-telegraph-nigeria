Ex-international, Segun Odegbami, has tipped the Super Eagles to play in the final match of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. The former Shooting Stars forward said Eagles should have nothing to worry about insisting the 2019 AFCON draws could favour them. Odegbami said the expectation of Nigerians on the team’s possible chances of going all the way to winning the 2019 AFCON was not misplaced at all, believing the team has enough fighting spirit and few individual qualities needed to emerge victorious or at least play in the final game. “The current crop of players in the team may not be playing in the European Champions League like Mohammed Salah and Sadio Mane they can spring surprise like the team that won it in South Africa in 2013,” he said.
“What is required of the team is to play more Grade A friendly matches before the AFCON final in June.” He advised the Super Eagles Manager, Gernot Rohr to base his selection on merit if he wants to succeed in Morocco.
