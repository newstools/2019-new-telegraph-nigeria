With a view to curbing undue influence or interference with match officials, the Nigeria National League, has warned clubs and their officials to keep their distance from the game’s arbiters.
Clubs and their officials are not to have any dealings with match officials before, during and after matches.
Such clubs or officials contravening the directive shall pay a fine of N1m and any other sanction.
The NNL noted that the appointment of match officials is the statutory function of the Nigeria Football Federation and its relevant committees.
The Football Associations in each state who represent the NFF are mandated to receive the umpires on arrival, accommodate them and ensure their safety before, during and after the games.
Chief Operating Officer, Lawrence Katken, said the League body has put adequate logistics in place for the duration of the matches and as such, state FAs are empowered to handle matches on behalf of the NFF/NNL.
