The General Overseer of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries worldwide (MFM), Dr. Daniel Kolawole Olukoya, has lost his mother, Madam Janet Olukoya at 95 years old. Mama Olukoya died peacefully in her sleep in the wee hours of 31th of March, 2019, which was exactly 25 years after she lost her husband.    Dr. Olukoya, who officially announced the demise of his nonagenarian mother while rounding off the monthly Power Must Change Hands prayer programme of the church last Saturday, directed the congregation to shout seven halleluiah first, and afterwards, simply said that he was announcing that his mother has gone to be with the Lord.   Mama was said to have been a fervent worshipper at the MFM International Headquarters, Onike-Yaba, Lagos, where she was a prayer warrior and a member of the Elders Group.   The burial programme of Mama Olukoya will be announced later. She is survived by Dr. Daniel Olukoya and Mrs. Funmilayo Olowoake, also a member of the MFM, grandchildren and other family members.
