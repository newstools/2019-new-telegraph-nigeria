The Golden Eaglets started their quest for a third continental title at the 2019 U-17 Africa Cup of Nations on a scintillating note on Sunday as they beat hosts Tanzania 5-4 in a thrilling encounter. Manu Garba’s lads displayed occasional brilliance all through the edgeof- the-seat encounter despite the huge support for their opponents. The early exchanges saw both sides missed half-chances but it was Olatomi Olaniyan that got the goals floodgate open with a low shot in the 21st minute. The vociferous home crowd kept cheering their team and they were boosted as they responded almost immediately as Edmund John levelled the tie. The Eaglets soon pulled away scoring two quick-fire goals in the 31st and 37th minute through Wisdom Ubani and then Akinkunmi Amoo respectively to head to the break with a comfortable lead. Eaglets could have pulled away further but for poor marksmanship and they were almost forced to pay for that as Kelvin John reduced the deficit to 3-2. And to make matters worse for Nigeria, two debatable penalties were awarded to the hosts which they converted to take control of the match. Not deterred by the unfavourable calls by the officials, The Eaglets, who are fivetime champions of the world, mounted relentless pressure on the hosts and their efforts paid off as Ubani scored his second goal of the game to make it 4-4 before Ibraheem Jabaar scored the winning goal in the 79th minute. Next up for the Eaglets is Angola and they are billed to wrap up their final group match against Uganda. The Eaglets are semi-finalists at the last edition and after winning the regional qualifier in Nigeria last year by beating Ghana they are one of the favoutires for the title.
