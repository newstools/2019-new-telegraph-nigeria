Two of the Nollywood stars featured on “Do Good”, the Africa Magic TV series that made recently-deceased actor, Duke Oliver, popular, Kate Henshaw and Uzor Osimkpa, have reacted to the death of the man widely known as LinChung.
Oliver, who passed away in a car crash while heading back to Lagos days after the burial of his late mum, is the latest Nollywood star to have lost his life in recent times.
A heartbroken Henshaw wrote: “Goodbye “Sylvanus” May the Lord receive your soul…Your role in “DO GOOD” brought smiles to many. You were a lively person, full of humour despite the obstacles life threw your way. RIP bro… Please help me say a prayer for his soul. God bless you all my dears.” On her own, Osimkpa, apparently too shocked about the unpleasant news, wrote: “This one enter me o! My Oga Sylva!!! Not sure of what else to say… What a painful loss. REST!”
