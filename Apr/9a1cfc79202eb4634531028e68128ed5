Tony Tetuila, one of the three who made up Remedies, widely regarded as Nigeria’s pioneer music group, has lost his mother. The singer, who achieved fame in his solo career following the release of popular song, “Omode Meta” made the announcement of the passing of his mother in an Instagram post on Wednesday. While describing his mother as a “beautiful angel,” Tetuila said she will always remain in his mind. “Maami, God took you to a better place yesterday, heaven gained a beautiful angel……Rest in peace in Jesus name amen. You will always be on my mind…there is no one like you maami. Oh my God,” he wrote. Tetuila, who joined Eedris Abdulkareem and Eddy Montana (later Eddy Remedy) to form Remedies, left after the release of their iconic debut album which has the songs, “Shakomo” and “Judile”. The two remaining members of the group also went their ways not long after, with Eedris going on to enjoy a stellar solo career with Kennis Music. On his own, Tetuila also enjoy some fame, with songs like “Omo Pupa,” “Morning Time,” “Your Kind of Woman” among others. In his first album, Morning Time which was released in 1999, Tetuila dedicated the song titled “Mother” to his now deceased mother. Having been inactive on the music scene more than half of the last decade, he declared to run for the House of Assembly in his native Kwara State in the last general election back in 2015. However, he made no headway in his quest and many observers feel he is gearing up for another run come 2019.
