Former Monaco and Super Eagles striker, Victor Ikpeba, has declared that Nigeria’s Super Eagles are not favourites for the fast approaching 2019 Africa Cup of Nations finals taking place in Egypt despite being drawn in a decent group. Ikpeba speaking with journalists called on Nigerians to simply support the players and rally round them ahead of hostilities in Egypt. He said Nigerians should not expect the team to perform any miracle thinking that they are favourites for the title. He mentioned that host nation Egypt, Senegal, and Morocco as teams ahead of Nigeria in terms of chances but back the Eagles for a last four finish. “We are not favourites because I know people always think Super Eagles are favourites. We are not favourites in this tournament. I think the host nation Egypt that have hosted and won it before has a chance. So there are other favourites like Morocco and Senegal. “But the Eagles have what it takes to get to the last four and if we get to the last four, it will be an achievement.” Nigeria’s Super Eagles are back once again on the continent after missing out of the last two editions of the AFCON and are expected to scale through the group hurdle where they are drawn alongside Guinea, Madagascar and Burundi.
