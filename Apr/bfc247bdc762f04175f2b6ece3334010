Rising operational challenges have dwarfed earnings of Okomu Oil Palm Company Plc. Chris Ugwu writes  According to reports, as of early 1900, Nigeria palm oil was considered a dominant source of foreign exchange earnings.
Until the 1960s, Nigeria was the world’s largest producer of palm oil accounting for 43 per cent of global palm oil production.
However, over-reliance on traditional production methods, excessive tapping of palm trees for palm wine and the civil war between 1967-1970, and above all, over dependent to oil and gas as major source of revenue are factors that contributed to Nigeria’s inability to meet up with the global rise in demand for palm oil.
Notwithstanding, the likes of Okomu Oil Plc and Presco Oil Plc, two big commercial operators in the Nigerian palm oil sector have shown commitment in improving Nigerian economic outlook in the International community and bringing it out of the doldrums that has plagued it for over three decades, though, without challenges in financials of the companies.
While it was accepted generally that the overall economic and business climate was a mixed fortune due to mounting economic challenges, Okomu Oil was not insulated, as its full year profits dropped 9 per cent and share price movements have also declined, the company like others have remained susceptible to the challenges facing the manufacturing businesses in Nigeria.
In spite that market sentiments for the company has remained firm not only on the back of demand for palm oil, which outstrips local supply by almost 50 per cent but also beyond palm oil as rubber, which it also produce offers diversification opportunities, the share price stood flat at N80 per share year to date. Financials
Okomu Oil began the year 2018 impressive as Q1 sales, PBT and PAT posted double-digit growth.
It’s Q1 2018 results showed that sales grew by 25 per cent y/y to N7.3 billion. However, PBT slowed by 17 per cent y/y to N4.0 billion.
According to analysts at FBNQuest, although operating expenses grew by 116 per cent y/y and weighed on earnings, it was not strong enough to completely offset the y/y sales growth and a 1,251bp y/y gross margin expansion to 91 per cent. Owing to a 319bp y/y expansion in the tax rate to 12.7 per cent, PAT advanced by 13 per cent y/y to N3.5billion. On a sequential basis, sales and PBT doubled q/q. We attribute the q/q sales growth to seasonality trends – Q1 is usually among the strongest quarters for the palm oil companies.
“The palm oil segment remains the driver of growth for Okomu, accounting for 87 per cent of sales in Q1,” the experts said. “A breakdown of the revenue figure reveals that palm oil sales grew by 136 per cent q/q and 24 per cent y/y in Q1 versus flattish q/q and 27 per cent y/y growth for the rubber business.
“We attribute the topline growth seen in the palm oil segment more to volume than pricing. Despite our positive view on the segment, we continue to believe that the company’s pricing power could be at risk in the near term because of the return of importers/smugglers of palm oil who were crowded out when FX was not readily accessible and rates were not favorable. For 2018E, we see sales and PBT growth of 22 per cent y/y and 17 per cent y/y respectively.”
However, contrary to first quarter upbeat, the second quarter saw a drop in earnings as Okomu Oil Palm Plc Q2 2018 result showed that wherein earnings dipped 22 per cent YoY to N2.47 billion, translating to an EPS of N2.59. The dull Q2 performance eroded volumes-led gains in Q1 2018 as cumulative earnings in H1 2018 plunged 4.7 per cent YoY to N5.94 billion.
According to ARM Research analysts, in terms of driver, the company recorded revenue contraction of 14.9 per cent to N5.6 billion underpinned by weaker sales volume and in part falling local CPO prices (-2.5 per cent YoY) in Q2 2018. Okomu faced volumes pressures owing to lower than expected Yield Ton FFB/ ha in Q2 2018 (-33 per cent YoY to 2.51), which translated to a 10 per cent YoY contraction in volumes by our estimates (Q2 18: 12,000 MT).
They noted that despite sizeable fall in operating expenses (-25.9 per cent YoY to N1.51 billion), EBIT for the quarter dipped 34.8 per cent YoY to N2.95 billion, tailing weaker top line earnings, while related margin declined 16ppts to 52.7 per cent. However, having paid down its FCY owed to its parent company (Socfinal Group), finance expense slipped 50.5 per cent YoY to N125.63 billion.
“This in addition to tamer slump in finance income (Q2 18 -4.7 per cent YoY to N141 million), translated to a net finance income of N15.39 billion over the review period in relation to an expense of N106 billion in Q2 2017,” they added.
“Overall, the combination of dwindling revenues (Q2 2018: -14.9 per cent YoY) and cost pressures led the company to report weaker PAT which plunged 22 per cent to N2.47 billion in Q2 2018.”
Okomu’s Q3-18 result showed revenue dropped 9 per cent y/y to N3.74 billion, while post tax profit surged 7.2x y/y to N1.3 billion, translating to an EPS N1.36 (Q3-17: N0.17).
According to analysts at Cordros Capital,” whilst revenue came in short of our expectation, we highlight that the sharp jump in PAT was on the back of extremely low base in the corresponding period of last year, faster decline in COGS (-58 per cent y/y to N504 million) relative to revenue, and and lower effective tax rate.
“We highlight that the weaker than expected revenue was, to a large extent, caused by dwindling global CPO prices (-10.2 per cent q/q), which translated to pressured local CPO prices. In our view, sustained FX stability is likely to have aided smuggling of crude palm oil, thereby putting further pressure on domestic prices.
“Following the jump in gross profit, as well as the decline in OPEX (-10 per cent y/y to N1.46 billion), operating profit expanded for the period, with the corresponding margin rising by 16pps to 47.4 per cent.
“Okomu’s disappointing performance is not unexpected, as H2 performance has historically been weaker compared to H1, no thanks to seasonality factor between Apr-Jun and traditionally being an off-peak period for Crude Palm Oil (CPO) production.”
Contrary to expectation of analysts that 2018E will record growth, Okomu Oil Palm posted a 8.73 per cent drop in profit after tax for the financial year ended December 31, 2018.
According to the audited report obtained from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), the company recorded a profit after tax of N8.501 billion in 2018 as against N9.314 billion posted in 2017, representing a drop of 8.73 per cent.
Profit before tax declined by 7.21 per cent to N10.337 billion during the period under review from N11.140 billion a year earlier.
Revenue equally declined marginally by 0.019 per cent from N20.261 billion in 2017 to N20.251 billion in 2018. Analyst opinion/outlook
According to analysts at Cordros Capital, “following the 2018FY results and our recent discussion with management. After the unimpressive performance in 2018FY, we forecast EPS to grow by 2.3 per cent in 2019 and 24.6 per cent average over 2020-2021E, with a TP of N93.62/s (previously N91.57/s).
“Our revised estimate is driven by both the resurgent price of CPO and the expected boost to volume from additional mature plantations coming on stream both in 2020 and 2021, which should offset persisting energy cost challenges.
“The net impact of our adjustment translates to growth in PBT and PAT of 5.2 per cent y/y and 2.3 per cent y/y respectively in 2019, and average EPS growth of 24.6% in 2020-2021E. Our new TP of NGN93.6/s implies total upside of 21 per cent after incorporating expected dividend yield of 4.0 per cent.
Analysts at Afrinvest (West Africa) in a special report noted that in Nigeria, oil palm production and export historically contributed substantially to the country’s external reserves and agricultural gross domestic product (GDP), as palm oil and palm kernels exports were between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the country’s total exports.
It added that oil palm prices in Nigeria are relatively higher than international prices primarily due to import restrictions on the commodity following the introduction of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)’s list of 42 foreign exchange (FX) excluded items.
This policy, when introduced in 2015, according to report, led to a surge in oil palm prices as local demand for crude palm oil (CPO) soared while importation and total industry supply tapered.
It further noted that based on this, listed companies Okomu Oil Palm Plc and Presco Plc witnessed notable and faster pace of improvements in revenues and profitability even as growth in production expansion has been slower.
“Also, we highlight that listed companies have focused on expanding production, especially over the last three years by investing in increasing total land area under cultivation, expanding milling and refining facilities to meet up with expected additional output,” the report noted.
“We hence expect both companies to record continuous revenue and profitability growth over our forecast period.”
According to Afrinvest, based on their understanding of the sector, it was their view that the oil palm industry is keenly positioned to soar further over the coming years, as investments in expanding milling and refining capacity of listed sector players crystallise. Last line
Downgrading palm oil as a result of crude oil discovery was a big blunder that will continue to haunt Nigeria. The authorities have to come up with an innovative policy to encourage palm oil production firms. Okomu Oil Plc has recorded a 73.44 per cent increase in profit after tax for the half year ended June 30, 2017.
