Traders at the popular Watt Market in Calabar, Cross River State, yesterday watched helplessly as fire consumed property believed to worth millions of naira. The fire outbreak, which gutted over six houses and four shops, occurred at Eyo Edem Street, in Calabar South Local Government Area of the state.  A witness, Elizabeth Okon, said the incident occurred about 2.30a.m., and destroyed goods worth millions of naira. She said: “I want to believe that one of the shop owners may have left electrical appliances on and went home which ignited the fire when the light was later restored in the early hours of today (yesterday).”  Okon, however, commended the State Fire Service for responding in time. She said: “I commend the prompt response of the State Fire Service.”  Although no casualty or injury was recorded, none of the shop owners was able to salvage anything from the building which was completely razed down. The Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the State Fire Service, Mr. Cletus Makpere, said the officials responded to fire outbreak on time
