Alex Iwobi is always proud to wear the Arsenal jersey and hopes the club can make the Top Four at the end of the season. The Nigeria international started his 20th Premier League game of the season in Wednesday’s shocking 3-1 loss to Wolverhampton Wanderers at the Molineux. Iwobi reflected on his career at the Emirates Stadium outfit and is confident they can achieve their difficult objective of finishing in the Champions League positions despite the loss to Wolves. “I have been there since the age of six, so for me to be here and still playing for the team is like dream come true. Long may it continue, I am proud to wear the Arse-nal colours and the Arsenal shirt. We have been doing well this season and hopefully we can achieve the goals we set at the start of the season.” Iwobi is one of the players Nigeria depends on to perform well at the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.
