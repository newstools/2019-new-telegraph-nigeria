The Federal Government has said it was adopting new strategies to further improve and meet the sexual reproductive health needs of adolescents and women especially Persons Living with Disabilities (PWDs) in the country. Minister of Health, Prof. Isaac Adewole, who made this known at the launch of Reproductive Health (RH) and Gender, Adolescent School Health and Care for the Elderly (GASHE) documents, in Abuja, explained that it would provide policy direction for all actors and stakeholders on reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health service delivery, as well as address pertinent issues relating to gender and rights of persons living with disability. According to him, the document was aimed at achieving 11 set targets including the National Policy on the Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights of Persons with Disability with emphasis on Women and Girls, which was aimed at “repositioning all sexual and reproductive health programmes to reach and serve persons with disabilities, especially the Sexual and Reproductive Health needs of Women and Girls with Disabilities (WGWD) who are disproportionately affected.  “This policy will also serve as an advocacy and resource mobilization tool to stimulate government and community actions at all levels of our health care delivery system. “The documents that we are launching today have been designed to address emerging issues and to adopt evidence-based practices that have been implemented at scale to address the sexual and reproductive health challenges of adolescents and women including persons living with disabilities in Nigeria,” he said. Adewole who commended Federal Government’s efforts in recording some significant progress over the years in the scale up of critical interventions to improve the sexual and reproductive health outcomes of adolescents and women in the country, however maintained that a lot still needs to be done to achieve its set goals by 2020.  He gave assurances of government’s commitment towards an improved, comprehensive and integrated sexual reproductive health service delivery for the citizenry. “While we are proud of the progress that we have made over the years, we need to do more work to achieve our set goals and also look beyond 2020 to build on our successes and address the bottlenecks that pose the challenge of access to quality family planning choices that our women need to actualisation their reproductive health decisions,” he added.
