The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described the Federal High Court decision on the collation of Rivers State governorship election as a triumph for democracy.  The party in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the ruling has rekindled the hope of Nigerians on the capacity of the judiciary to uphold the will of the people, particularly the quest to reclaim the presidential mandate.  The PDP further described the ruling as well as the on-going collation as the triumph of the will of the people of Rivers State, who freely gave their mandate to the partyâ€™s candidate, Governor Nyesom Wike. The party expressed confidence in the collation of the result, noting that the sweeping victory being recorded by Wike even in areas hitherto considered as opposition fortresses, clearly exposes the reason behind All progressives Congress (APC) desperation to scuttle the collation process.  It called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure that nothing encumbers the conclusion of the collation process and rightful winner of the election announced.  The party also directed its members and supporters in Rivers State to continue to be at alert to forestall any attempt by anti-democratic forces, working for the APC, to disrupt the exercise.
