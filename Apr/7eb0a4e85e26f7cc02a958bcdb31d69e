The state chairman of NUJ, Comrade Victoria Asher, said they were in his palace to condole with the Ter Tyoshin over the frequent attacks on his people by suspected Fulani herdsmen. Comrade Asher who prayed God to give the traditional ruler the wisdom of King Solomon to rule over his people encouraged him not to relent in his efforts at resisting the invasion and take over of the peopleâ€™s ancestral land by the herders. The NUJ chairman assured him that the union will continue to partner with his palace in the area of publicity to attract attention to the plight of his people.
