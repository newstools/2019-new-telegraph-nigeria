 Grand Cereals Limited (GCL), Jos, a subsidiary of UAC of Nigeria, has donated 2,000 bags of maize flour to internally displaced persons (IDPs) camp and other vulnerable groups in Gubio, Maiduguri, Borno state.
Speaking at the presentation ceremony in Gubio, recently, the General Manager, Supply Chain of the company, Abdulrasheed Bello, explained that the donation was part of the company’s corporate social responsibility to displaced persons in Borno state in particular and the North East in general.
“This event to us is very important because it is part of our corporate social responsibility, to support the Federal Government, state governments, National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) and all that have been contributing towards alleviating the sufferings of the IDPs.
“UACN as a company supports every community where it operates and we in the company share with what Borno state is facing, with regards to the issue of insurgency,” Bello added.
Bello, who was in company of National Sales Manager, Edibles, GCL, explained that the company was committed to making more impact in the state’s IDPs.
In her speech at the occasion, the Chairperson, SEMA, Hajiya Yabawa Kolo, expressed the agency’s immense appreciation to GCL for the commendable gesture to the IDPs.
She also used the opportunity to call on well-meaning Nigerians as well as donor agencies to lend a helping hand to the IDPs as government and non-governmental organisations cannot do it all alone.
The Director, Relief and Disaster Management, SEMA, Alhaji Isa Yawuba, who represented the SEMA chairman, appealed to the IDPs not to feel neglected, adding that awareness was still on to enlighten the public about their pitiable plight. He also assured them that more help was on the way.
“Hopefully, this GCL’s exemplary and timely intervention should serve as a clarion call on other companies to assist in ameliorating the sufferings of IDPs,” he said.
