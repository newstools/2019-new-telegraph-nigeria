The Managing Director of New Telegraph Newspapers, Mrs. Funke Egbemode, yesterday called for increased working relationship between the Nigeria Guild of Editors (NGE) and the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), saying that such synergy would be beneficial to the wellbeing of journalism in the country.  She said there should be synergy between the NGE and the NUJ; so that the fraternity that existed between the two would be of mutual importance for the Nigeria state.  Speaking while visiting Kano State, the managing director said in the last few years that she had been president of the Nigeria Guild of Editors, she had tried to build a formidable relationship between editors and their working colleagues.  Funke commended Kano Council of the NUJ for conducting themselves in a more matured and professional manner, which she said made them exemplary in the federation.   “The only place we saw this kind of maturity and excellent relationship between the Guild and the NUJ was in faraway China, not knowing it’s highly workable in our country.”  NUJ Kano Council Chairman, Abbas Ibrahim, said the council was proud of the excellent achievements of the President of the Guild of Editors in the last few years she had been there.  Ibrahim said: “Today in the world of journalism, Funke Egbemode is a success story and also a source of inspiration, whose qualities should be imbibe for better journalism practices.”  Sule Yau Sule, who was a former Director of Press in Kano and a veteran journalist, said today; “What is actually missing is that sound relationship between working journalists on ground and their editors and if that is achieved, the practice would tremendously improve for the better.”
