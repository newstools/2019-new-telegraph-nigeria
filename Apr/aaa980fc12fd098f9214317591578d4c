The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr Ibe Kachikwu, has tasked indigenous operators to step up their investments and take over major operations from international oil companies. Kachikwu made the assertion at the opening ceremony of the 2019 Nigeria Oil and Gas Opportunities Fair (NOGOF) in Yenagoa, Bayelsa. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the 2019 NOGOF conference with about 1,500 participants was tagged: “Maximising Oil and Gas Industry for Benefit of Nigerian People”. The minister said that it became important, especially as many were considering divesting and charting new paths. According to him, changes in the global oil and gas industry were presently challenging the present exploration and investment strategies.This, he said, was because, oil is fast becoming a degenerating asset with alternative sources of energy taking over and attracting new investments. Kachikwu said, while the world was moving on from fossil fuels, Nigeria has yet to take advantage of the opportunities in the sector and design strategies to harness advantages of renewables. The minister urged indigenous firms to take over and stop playing safe if they would benefit from the opportunities availed through new trends in the industry. Kachikwu said that the Federal Government had reduced the cost of crude production to $23 per barrel from about $32. He said that some companies in the Joint Venture with NNPC had already driven the cost down to $15. The minister said henceforth, approval for projects in the petroleum industry would be based on the cost of producing oil and gas. “The ministry is going to come up with a benchmark to analyse and compare companies who do business in Nigeria and what cost of production they are running. “This is because any unbelievable cost of production, basically impacts on the revenue stream of the country. “We need to start finding out how companies awarded recognition are doing, and why are the others not going in that direction.
