A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Ken Imansuangbon, yesterday said he shed tears of joy over the declaration of Sokoto State Governor, Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal and Imo State Governor-elect, Hon. Emeke Ihedioha, as winners of the just concluded governorship elections in their states. Imansuangbon, who is a former governorship aspirant in Edo State, said the declaration of the two PDP governors by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), had rekindled hope for other states in the country to brace-up for similar victories. The PDP chieftain, who commended residents of Edo State for keeping fate with the party, despite all odds, also applauded the security agencies for the protection of lives and properties in Edo State during and after the elections. He said: “The re-election of the Sokoto State Governor, Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal, and the emergence of Emeka Ihedioha of Imo State as governor elect is a sign that Nigerian electorate are getting more conscious of their immediate environment. Our people are more interested in personalities not political parties.”
