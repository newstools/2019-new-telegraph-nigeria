All seems not to be well within the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos State, considering development within the party in the last few months. In the last 20 years, PDP has always been losing many of its leaders to the ruling party during election periods and the last election was not an exception. The Lagos PDP lost its chairman, Hon. Mashood Salvador to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Following PDP’s poor performance at the just concluded polls, the centre couldn’t hold again and this has led to a chieftain of the party, Otunba Segun Adewale, taking over the leadership of the opposition party in Lagos. This is not the first time Aeroland, as Adewale is fondly called would be coming to the rescue of the PDP. He was at the helm of affairs during the last local government election in the state. Adewale seems to be on another rescue mission, but the question begging for answer is, how far can he go?
