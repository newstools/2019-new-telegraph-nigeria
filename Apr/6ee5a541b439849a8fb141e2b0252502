Olympic long jump gold medallist, Chioma Ajunwa, has said that Nigeria is not working towards having a good impact at the next Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan next year.
The 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games champion said in a Radio programme monitored in Abuja that with the dearth of activities in the country on the selection of athletes and camping, Nigeria was not ready for next year’s summer Olympics.
The Imo State-born Police officer believes the time is too short and that Nigeria cannot perform any magic in Tokyo because other countries that are serious with their participation are currently organising training and camp activities for the athletes.
Ajunwa said: “It is a pity that in this country, we like to fail all the time. I believe as an individual, we should learn from other people’s mistakes.
“But we refuse to learn. Olympic 2020 is barely a year from now and this is where we are. I don’t know the kind of athletes we are going to take to Tokyo 2020 that up till now we are not hearing anything.
“People have not started going out for exposure and training. Even if you cannot take them out, why not camp them here in the country? We are talking about Olympics; what kind of Olympics are we talking about?
“It is clear to those of us with deep knowledge of sports that Nigeria is not ready to keenly compete at 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Other countries that really want to perform in the Olympics are currently training and doing their competitions, taking them out to compete. But here, we start our training within two to three months, it is not good that way.
“I don’t think we are going to Tokyo to compete and win but I believe if we really want to do that, we should know what to do.”
The 1990 Commonwealth bronze medallist advised ministry of sports and those saddled with the responsibility of preparing Nigeria athletes to buckle up and stop wasting the collective resources if they knew Team Nigeria will make impactful participation.
