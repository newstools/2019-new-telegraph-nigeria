have emerged in Asaba, Delta State capital, that the internal wrangling rocking the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) prevented those who lost in the just-concluded general elections to file their petitions at the state’s Election Petition Tribunal.  A chieftain of the party told New Telegraph in Asaba yesterday that for fear of the unknown, candidates of the party who lost in the election were scared of wasting more money at the tribunal, owing to the nullification of their candidature.  He said the governorship candidate of the party, Chief Great Ogboru, had been battling to authenticate his candidature and those of other candidates of the party, which was nullified two weeks ago, but upheld by the Court of Appeal five days ago respectively.  The Federal High Court in Asaba in suit No. FA/ ASA/CS/76/2018, presided  over by Justice Toyin Adegoke, had sacked the current executive of the APC led by Prophet Jones Erue that was inaugurated by the National Chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomole and declared all its actions since inauguration null and void.  The court restored the factional primary election which produced Chief Cyril Ogodo-led executive that was initially inaugurated by Chief Odigie Oyegun-led National Working Committee (NWC) of the party.
