 Golden Eaglets coach, Manu Garba, is keen to see his side triumph against Guinea in the semifinal clash of the U-17 AFCON in Tanzania.  The Nigerian cadet players topped their group which also saw them clinch their place at the World Cup in Brazil and Garba declared he has put behind him his team’s group phase form at the eight-nation championship.  On his boys’ chances against Guinea on Wednesday, Garba said: “I had five first-team players who had their first international match when we played Tanzania, so they are just trying to get their confidence in the tournament.  “I must say the semi-final is going to be a different ball game entirely because it is going to be highly tactical.  “We intend to see whoever we are playing so that we can map out the strategies to make sure we get into the final.”  Garba, who coached Nigeria to win the World Cup in 2013, reiterated that the biggest hurdle he is facing at the championship is inexperience on the part of his players, but reckoned that they are already overcoming their naivety.  Following a 5-4 opening day shaky victory against the hosts, Tanzania, Gabra’s wards got a narrow 1-0 win against Angola in their second match and wrapped up the group stage with a come-from-behind 1-1 draw with Uganda on Saturday.  The 53-year-old coach admitted that his team had a shaky progression, but would rather take possitives from his belief that the lads have improved with each passing match, and will step up even further against Guinea on Wednesday.  He, however, acknowledged that the semi-final is bound to be a different ball game, considering that all remaining teams at this stage have already qualified for the FIFA U-17 World Cup in Brazil, and will aim to justify their new found statuses.
