Adeosun alleged that the accused collected N785,000 from five LASU students namely Mr Daniel Emmanuel, Mr Felix Okunbor, Mr Abraham Odamah, Mrs Glory Emmanuel and Mr Emmanuel Izuagie on the pretence of helping them to register for foreign exchange trading. “The accused stole the sum of N785,000 which belonged to these five students of the institution as the accused failed to fulfill his part of the agreements he reached with the complainants,” the prosecutor said. Adeosun said that the offences contravened Sections 314 and 287 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 as amended. The Magistrate, Mr Lazarus Hotepo, granted the accused bail in the sum of N200, 000  with two sureties in like sum and adjourned the case until April 24 for mention. (NAN)
