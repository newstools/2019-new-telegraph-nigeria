United Kingdom (UK) government has called on Nigerian ladies to find jobs at home instead of “risking a life of modern slavery” in Britain. According to the Independent, posters are to be placed in schools, churches and marketplaces in an attempt to reduce human trafficking, sexual exploitation and forced labour. The advice is part of a campaign which focuses on “aspirational stories of women who have established successful careers in Nigeria,” according to the Department for International Development. The ‘Not for Sale’ campaign is supported by UK aid and involves the National Crime Agency and the UK’s Joint Border Task Force as well as Nigerian law enforcement. One of the stories featured in the posters, TV and radio adverts relates to Gift Jonathan, a single mother who was raped and tortured while attempting to get to Europe but has since returned to Nigeria and found work as a pastry chef. The woman said three years ago, she was a single mother with two children living with her widowed mother. But things were so hard that when a friend told her about travelling to Germany, she grabbed the opportunity with both hands. She said: “We only made it to Libya. I was sold, raped and tortured. I saw many Nigerians die, including my friend, Iniobong. “When I made it to Nigeria, I met with people who registered me in a vocational centre and encouraged me. Today I’m a baker in Benin, making enough money to take care of my family. My boys will not grow up to be ashamed of their mother. My name is Gift Jonathan and I am not for sale.” Nigeria has one of the highest figures for modern slavery in Africa and is one of the top five countries of origin for modern slavery victims reaching Europe and the UK. In 2018 alone, 208 Nigerian nationals were identified as potential victims of trafficking in the UK. The International Development Secretary, Penny Mordaunt, said: “Modern slavery is one of the greatest human rights abuses of our time.
