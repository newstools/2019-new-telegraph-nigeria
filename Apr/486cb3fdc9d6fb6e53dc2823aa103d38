The entrance of missionaries into eastern part of Nigeria cannot be complete without mentioning St. Christopher’s Anglican Church and the significant role it played in the growth of the Anglican Communion in Igbo land. The history of St. Christopher’s Church is as old as the inception of Christianity in Igbo land as far back as 1857. Today, the church has grown to be one of the most revered Anglican churches in the eastern region. As they dedicate a new church edifice, it becomes worthy to recount its history that dates back almost 200 years and how far God has brought this ‘Hallowed Ground’ tucked nicely away in the east of the Niger…   CHRISTIANITY IN IGBOLAND The journey of a thousand mile they say starts with a step, and this strictly applies to the historical origin of St Christopher’s Anglican Church, Onitsha in Anambra State. The European benevolence and their attending mission evangelical passion for lost souls brought them to the Niger River bank in 1857 for missionary enterprise. Thus, the history of St Christopher’s Church Odoakpu, Onitsha is to a reasonable extent as old as the inception of Christianity in Igbo geographical milieu. A brief survey and rundown of the activities of the missionaries in the early days of their arrival in Igbo land will make a solid historical foundation vis-à-vis the origin of St Christopher’s Anglican Church, Onitsha. It was reliably gathered that the missionaries landed in Onitsha on the 25th day of July, 1857 at about 4pm. The following day, precisely on a Sunday, they held a church service on board the steamer that brought them and they read from Luke 19:10 “For the Son of Man came to seek and save those who are lost”. At about 2pm the same day, Dr. Baikie, Davis, Rev Crowther, Rev J.C. Taylor, Mr. May, Barter Dalton and Captain Grant went to meet Obi Akazua – the King of Onitsha at that time and there they promised to pay him another visit the next day. <img class="size-medium wp-image-203457 alignleft" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/History-of-St.-Christopher%E2%80%99s-Anglican-Church-Parish-Onitsha-300x156.png?resize=300%2C156&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="156" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/History-of-St.-Christopher’s-Anglican-Church-Parish-Onitsha.png?resize=300%2C156&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/History-of-St.-Christopher’s-Anglican-Church-Parish-Onitsha.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1">On Monday, July 27, 1857, they returned to Obi Akazua as promised and explained their mission in Igbo land.  THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MISSION HOUSE To put the records straight and to lend a voice of inquisition, one may need to ask certain questions like: from where did the missionaries operate i.e. where they did reside? In whose house were they living when they arrived Igbo land? One may not successfully answer these questions neither can one confidently write the history of St Christopher’s Church without bringing into question the situation of the first mission compound of the missionaries. The missionaries were well received by the king and his people and upon request were offered a place of lodging. However, considering the primitiveness and the bushy nature of the available surroundings and structures offered, and considering the risk of exposing oneself to wild beasts and animals, chose to move to Chief Menyua’s house situated within the old cemetery axis as a temporal residence. It was from Chief Menyua’s house they found a piece of land on which the mission house was to be built. On August 2 which was Revd. J.C Taylor’s first Sunday in his new station; he wrote this in his journal: “Where am I this day? Where is my stated congregation who want me in hearty response of our beautiful liturgy? Where is the pulpit to deliver the message of the Sovereign God, the universal king? I am now plainly in a strange country.” At 10.30am, he conducted a divine service for the first time in Igbo land. He began with the beautiful hymn “Jesus shall reign where’re the sun”, and many of the traders joined him in singing the song. He preached in the open air from 2 Corinthians 10:14, and about 260 to 400 half-dressed men and women and naked boys and girls were in attendance. In the afternoon of the same day, at about 4:30pm, he had another service in the king’s palace “Okwu Eze” using the same text he had used in the morning to a congregation of about 500-600 souls. Simon Jonas was his interpreter. That week, 12 children were brought to them for education and J.C. Taylor wrote “I looked up on them as the commencement of our direct missionary work.” After spending barely three months in Igbo land, on October 25, 1857 to be precise, Taylor wrote: “If there is any portion of the heathen world which would be born to God a day, this (Onitsha) is the place.”  At this time, the missionaries moved from Chief Menyua’s house to Okagbue Agba’s compound, situated somewhere within Venn Road and Christ Church axis. It was from there they started the foundation of the mission house that is today known as St Christopher’s Church Old Compound.  On December 11, 1857 Revd. J.C. Taylor laid the foundation of the mission house and on March 18, 1858, the house was completed and at about 4pm of the same day, the missionaries moved into it as their official residence. On March 21, 1858, the first church service in St Christopher’s Anglican Church Onitsha was held and Revd. Taylor preached the sermon from Ezra 5:1 with the beautiful hymn: “Great God! The nations of the earth “Are by creation thine “And in thy works, by all beheld “They radiant glories shine”.  PLANTING OF NEW CHURCHES It must be noted that at this time in history, St Christopher’s Church, Onitsha was the only official worship place for the early missionaries and consequently the “Diocesan Church Centre”. The Lord kept adding to the church those who were being saved. When the congregation started increasing, the missionaries saw it as an answered prayer and a great opportunity to win the whole of Igbo land to Christ. Consequently, the missionaries moved to ‘Taylor’s land’ towards the Niger riverbank to establish a worship place that is today known as Christ Church, Onitsha (Ebube Niger). Thus, Christ Church was the offshoot of St Christopher’s Church consequent of overflow in the numerical strength of the converted congregation. With further increase in the number of the new converts, there was need to expand the missionary base at the old compound. With respect to this and for the expansion of Christ’s kingdom in Igbo land, in 1864 and 1868, Immanuel Church and St Stephen’s Church Onitsha both in inland town were founded respectively. The early missionaries to have planted up to four church within the space of 10 years was a great achievement considering the religious-cultural terrain of Igbo land at that time and the herculean nature of missions.  ST CHRISTOPHER CHURCH AS CHILDREN’S CHURCH Every Church is peculiar and unique and has something for which it is known. St Christopher’s Anglican Church from the outset has a peculiar nature and feature for which it is known in the missionary days. The church cared very much for children’s welfare. Thus, the presence of children is one important feature in the old mission compound. At that time, St Christopher’s Church was referred to as Uka Umuaka (Children’s Church). Before the arrival of the missionaries,        the Igbo killed twins often throwing them away in the forest to die.  They saw the birth of twins as an abomination/taboo (“Alu/Nso ala”) in the land. Thus, the missionaries that were residing in the mission house (St Christopher’s Church) engaged on a campaign against the killing of twins. In 1863, the missionaries started collecting and nurturing twin children abandoned at the Ozalla evil forest. Ozalla evil forest is the piece of land that today houses the All Saints’ Cathedral through bishop’s court. All the children that were thrown away in the forest were thus brought to the mission house to be nurtured and nursed. Indeed, St Christopher’s Church wasn’t only meeting the spiritual needs of the people, it was also meeting their health needs as their concern to save the children’s lives brought about the establishment of a dispensary for easy administration of drugs which in turn gave birth to Iyi Enu Mission Hospital Ogidi and it was admirably managed by Edith Warner Maxwell by 1897. The gong of the spiritual vibrancy of the church and the establishment of health facilities was noised in Onitsha and environs and as a testimony to this, the first Obosi converts who were 57 in number comprising of 22 children, 18 men and 17 women were baptized at St Christopher in 1884.  THE FOUNDATION STONE LAYING OF THE OLD CHURCH BUILDING St Christopher’s Anglican Church continued growing under the pastorate and leadership of the early missionaries. Many people gave their lives to Christ but since St Christopher’s Church was not an adult church, the new converts were attending other CMS churches within the Onitsha metropolis and this consequently affected the numerical strength of the church. However, the few people in their little numerical strength who have been taught to love the Lord grew in faith and in due course decided to erect a new structure for the service of the Lord. This was welcomed with jubilation and excitement as many of the members whose lives had been touched were willing to join in this divine project. To the glory of God, the old church building was started, and on October 23, 1953, St Christopher’s old church building’s Foundation Stone laying ceremony was done and presided over by the Rt. Rev. C.J. Patterson, the then Bishop on the Niger.
As a typical children’s church, the church was dedicated to children considering the inscription on the plaque of the foundation stone “Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God”.   INAUGURATION OF ST CHRISTOPHER’S CHURCH AS A PARISH  The fact that St Christopher’s Church was known as “Uka Umuaka” affected her and brought about delay in some of the statuses she was supposed to have attained. For a very long time, all children in Onitsha worshipped at St Christopher’s Church while the adults worshipped at Christ Church, Immanuel Church, St Stephen’s Church and later St Andrews’ Church. The church ab initio was meant to be for ‘Uka Umuaka’ alone but this long standing idea was thwarted in 2000 by the late Archbishop Jonathan Onyemelukwe when he was set to declare the church a parish ‘adult’ church. The church was formally on February 20, 2000 inaugurated as a full-fledged parish by the late Most Revd. Jonathan Onyemelukwe. The late Archbishop was overwhelmed both by what he saw on that day and by his prior knowledge of the spiritual status of the church. He indeed felt the presence of God in the Church, most glaringly the spiritual sensitivity and sanity of the church compound. Thus, as a prophet, who knows the history of the church, he decided to name St Christopher’s Church “The Hallowed Ground”. On that day of inauguration, the Archbishop declared that St Christopher’s Church was hereby converted into both an adult and children’s church and would no longer be referred to as only a children’s church (Uka Umuaka).  ST CHRISTOPHER’S CHURCH AS “EFAC CHURCH” St. Christopher’s Anglican Church is known in Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion) as “EFAC Church”. This does not mean it is owned/built by EFAC neither does it mean it is only EFAC that worship there, it simply implies that it is the place of nurture of EFAC in eastern Nigeria. Thus, St. Christopher’s Church is the spiritual headquarter of EFAC in Nigeria. In 1986, EFAC officially commenced their fellowship and activities at St Christopher’s Church. In the year 2011, Bro Onyebuchi Ugwuanyi was elected as St Christopher’s EFAC leader and this turned another new page for the group as he served for two tenures. During his tenure, the group broke another record which cannot easily be forgotten no matter what. They erected an office complex of four storey building that was near 90% completion before its collapse one fateful Monday. The testimony is that the building did not collapse the previous day being Sunday when brethren were in the building holding one meeting or the other in the different rooms of the building. In 2017, Bro Nnamdi Igwegbe, who is the current leader, was elected the 7th head of the group. This new and present leadership has ensured that all the activities they inherited from their predecessors continued. They are trying their best under the present leadership of Revd. Canon Chibueze Abone. The current EFAC leadership created what they called the “Elders’ Council” that cuts across all the past leaders and some renowned elders so as to help provide counsel, supervision and direction in the leadership of the fellowship. Under this leadership as well, the group donated a beautiful pulpit for the new church edifice as well as other numerous things they have achieved and in view.  ST CHRISTOPHER’S CHURCH AS PACESETTERS It is common for people to enjoy things they don’t know how it started as some of the practices we have in the church now were not obtainable before the arrival of EFAC.
Many people who do not understand the move thought that EFAC had come to ridicule and mock the doctrines of the church. Luckily, the reverse was the case. Through scriptural backups and logical reasoning, they were able to stop some of the practices that were not helping the church and also started up the ones that are of great benefit to the church. Most significantly of all was the issue of bazaar sales that was practiced all over the Anglican Church. St. Christopher’s Church reasoned thoughtfully about bazaar sales and found out the church loses a lot of money through that, as many people may buy things worth hundreds of thousands of naira and take them home without paying. They saw that a bird at hand is worth two in the bush. This made them to abolish the idea of holding bazaars in their church and for the first time in the history of Anglican Church in the eastern part of Nigeria, cash harvest was introduced in 1998 to be precise.
The cash harvest notion was initially met with criticism and backlash all through the diocese. Many people kicked against it and called St Christopher’s Church all sorts of names. This in part was because some people thought our church was ‘over spiritual’, while the economy minded group criticized it because of the huge sums of “unpayable” money generated during Harvest Bazaar sales. It was an all-against one fight in the Diocese on the Niger. Albeit nothing stands in the way of the Most High. This was evident as not long after, many churches succumbed to the cash harvest notion and like wildfire it spread throughout the diocese and beyond. Apart from the abolition of bazaar sales, when many churches were worshipping in vernacular, the church considered that there are foreigners who live and worship with us in our services and that these people needed to be considered for effective propagation of the gospel. This mind-set made the church to opt for alternative language that will carry even foreigners along in our services. The year 1996 nevertheless heralded St Christopher’s Church’s first English service in the diocese. This development was welcomed by many people within the vicinity although not without criticism. Today virtually every church in the diocese worships in English language as well as in vernacular. St Christopher’s Church indeed are pacesetters when it comes to innovations and showing others the right way for them to follow.  POSTING OF CHURCH WORKERS TO ST. CHRISTOPHER’S CHURCH All the church workers that have served in St Christopher’s from 1996-2014 have done marvellously well in moving the church from one stage to another.

This made the then Bishop on the Niger, late Archbishop Onyemelukwe deem it necessary to send clergymen to the church.  ACQUISITION OF LAND FOR THE NEW CHURCH BUILDING  Revd. Rufus Ezenwaka was replaced     with Ven. Chidi Nwadike from Ideani in Anambra State. His arrival to St Christopher’s Church heralded a new season for the church. His visionary and evangelical mind-set alongside his selfless personality made it clear that St Christopher’s Church members are not only adherents of the great commission mandate but generous givers. As a 21st Century pastor, he understood the essence of worshipping God in a magnificent edifice hence his first vision was how to acquire land for the new church building project. Ven. Nwadike as one who leads by example, gave a substantial amount of his annual stipend to ensure that the new church building site was acquired (the site has always been the property of the church. It was the burial ground of many early missionaries. The church only sought to reclaim that which is hers). It is worthy of note that the acquisition of the site was a herculean task for the church. We express our gratitude to our Bishop Rt. Revd. Dr Owen Nwokolo who mandated the church to go and acquire the site of the new church building when we have already drawn the plan to start the new church building in the old church compound.  Your lordship, retrospective analysis has shown us that what an elder sees sitting down, a child cannot see it even if he climbs the palm tree. We thank God for making you our backbone in that quest. Indeed, the process the church went through in the acquisition of the new church building site is better imagined than experienced. This is because of the countless legal actions and enormous resistances we met in the hands of some unscrupulous individuals. We will not completely enumerate all that they did to stall the work of God and how God saw us through. When the church met the resistance during the acquisition of the new church building site, the following were summoned and commissioned to make sure what is ours was not lost: Elder Sam Onwuasonaya Elder Nnamdi Igwegbe Elder Joseph Ilechukwu Evang. Nat Okafor Evang. Nchedo Mmadu Mr. Ogoo Ezeaghabalu These men fought gallantly and as God would have it, the land in contention was restored and secured. Verily, we saw that if God be for us, no one can be against us (Rom 8:31). May His name be praised. Ven. Nwadike has all the unknown, known and inexplicable good qualities a leader can have. Having acquired the land and without hesitation, he constituted a committee for the building project and inaugurated them. The new church building committee comprises of the following:
Evang. Nat Okafor – Chairman Mrs Uche Okpala – Secretary Sir Nonso Mbaekwe Sir Innocent Umealajekwu Sir Okey Unogu Sir Tobenna Udeagu Mr Okey Akudu Mr. Sunday Egboluche It is worthy to note that the foundation of the new church building was started in September 2013 under Ven. Chidi Nwadike. At the end of 2013, we received the news of his transfer to St Paul’s Church Oba as the Archdeacon of Oba Archdeaconry. The news indeed came with a mixed feeling of joy and sadness as the church was thrown into pandemonium and tears of joy. Consequently, he left the new church building project underway at the initial stage for the new vicar that will take over from him. Ven. Nwadike spent one year that cannot be forgotten in a hurry in the history of the church.  THE FOUNDATION STONE LAYING OF THE NEW CHURCH BUILDING In January 2014, a new, young and vibrant priest in the person of Revd. Chibueze Abone (now Revd. Canon) from Nnokwa, Anambra State was posted to St Christopher’s Church to take over from Ven. Nwadike. On Saturday, September 13, 2014, the foundation stone of the St. Christopher’s new church building was laid by Rt. Rev Dr Owen Nwokolo through the efforts of Revd. Canon Abone as the new Vicar of St Christopher’s Church. On the day of the foundation stone laying, the Bishop observed that the new St Christopher’s Church building was not built to the expected size and standard befitting of St Christopher’s congregation and suggestively appealed to the Vicar and the Building Committee to see what they can do to increase the building capacity. This Episcopal suggestion was indeed tasking and posed serious challenge both to the Vicar and the Building Committee because the building was up to the roofing level at the time of the foundation stone laying ceremony. The obvious truth is that the new church building project almost started from the scratch in other to effect the expansion work suggested by the Lord Bishop. Consequently, Revd. Canon Abone, the Vicar and the Building Committee girded their loins and started the expansion work that nearly cost them double amount of money spent in erecting the first structure. He was consumed with the work of God thus giving him sleepless nights and headaches. His youthful age was a great asset to the church as he exemplified what the Bible says in Joel 2v28 “…that young men shall see vision’’. His visionary spirit led to the modification of the church structure. He is also instrumental to the many beautiful adornments in the church building. For this and many others which we lack space to profess, we say may the Lord set you above your contemporaries always in Jesus name, Amen. Thus, by God’s divine help, the new church building was started and completed to the glory of God. Furthermore, as an entrepreneurial priest, Revd. Canon Abone upon arrival surveyed the environment and saw that the church needs to have a secondary school that will address the moral and academic life of children living within the vicinity and beyond, he therefore made a bold step to establish a secondary school for the church. This secondary school today has a numerical strength of above 300 students and is still growing. God is still using him in so many ways to achieve his purpose in this church. May God reward you beautifully and sumptuously as you pilot the affairs of the church.  ST CHRISTOPHER’S CHURCH GETS A NEW NAME Many Church workers that served in St Christopher tapped into the anointing of promotion embedded in this Hallowed Ground. As a reward for Revd. Canon Abone’s hard work and selfless services to the lord’s vineyard, the news of his preferment in December 2017 as Canon of All Saint’s Cathedral was welcomed by St Christopher’s congregation with great pleasure and a deserving honour. Thus, it pleased the Lord to uplift our Vicar to be a Canon. On April 22, 2018, his institution and induction took place and on that day, God decided to give the church a new name through the instrumentality of the Bishop on the Niger, Rt. Rev. Dr. Owen Nwokolo who after seeing the eloquent spiritual vibrancy of the church, christened it “The Living Church”.  OTHER FACTS ABOUT ST CHRISTOPHER St Christopher’s Church is a centre of attraction when it comes to spiritual matters. They have so many illustrious sons and daughters whom the Lord is using in various ways to build his church. There are about 10 knights and ladies of St Christopher, many Gideonites on the Niger (GON) and Diocesan Merit Awardees (DMA) who use their time, life and resources to serve the Lord. St. Christopher’s Church has about six women and men’s groups. They also have Young Wives; they have vibrant organisations in the church viz: Anglican Youth Fellowship (AYF) who have gone for diocesan competitions severally and came back victoriously, Anglican Boys’ Fellowship (ABF) whose services were felt significantly, Anglican Students’ Ministry, Anglican Children’s Ministry, Girls’ Guild. St Christopher’s Church has a formidable choir and members of Boys’ and Girls’ Brigade, the Hallowed Youth Assembly, and interestingly, all these organisations and ministries are waxing strong.   APPRECIATION A lot of praise will be given to all the members of St Christopher’s Church whose persistence and doggedness in giving has made it possible that the church will be dedicated today. Their ‘Nnukwu Azu Kpata Nnukwu nku and obele azu kpata obele nku spirit’ is commendable. People thought it impossible for a church like St. Christopher’s to achieve this feat mostly because of our numerical strength and financial status, but with God all things are possible. In the spirit of appreciation and gratitude, we recognise the unfettered giving spirit of Sir Nonso Mbaekwe (GON), Sir Innocent Umealajekwu, Sir Okey Unogu, Sir Chigbo Umealajekwu and Mr Ifeanyi Uche. They are the financial spring of our church during the period of building this wonderful structure. ‘Chukwu gozie unu mmaji kwuru mmaji n’aha Jesus,’ Amen. We appreciate all the people that donated secretly and otherwise, the donors of the marble materials for the inner edification of the church: the altar table, the altar rail, the pulpit, the lectern, the reading desk, the baptismal font and other numerous things donated to ensure that the work of God never stopped, we say thank you all. We also send warm felicitations to the Building Committee. Their fierce drive is what led to the quick completion of this edifice. One unique feature in St. Christopher’s Church is that everyone personalized the work of God thus, making it simpler and easier to accomplish.
We bless God for your lives and pray that God will send embarrassing blessings your way in Jesus name Amen. The engineer that built the church in the person of Engr. Ibekwe of Taa Manual Construction is well appreciated for all his significant efforts and labours to give his best in the building project, God indeed will bless you. Bro Chidubem Olisa, the architect that designed the church and supervised it to the end must be appreciated for his display of expertise in the church building. We cannot afford to forget our brother Evang. Jonas Okezue, our site manager, for his doggedness and time in the supervision of the work. He sacrificed his personal interests and was consumed in the work. We are sincerely grateful to God for you. All other people that contributed in money, prayer and advice are well appreciated. All the people that worked in the kitchen, the security agents, and other artisans are warmly appreciated. Therefore, along with angels and archangels and all the company of heaven, we welcome everyone to the dedication of our new church building to the glory of God. It is the Lord’s doing and it is marvellous in our eyes.  Alleluia!!! Save
