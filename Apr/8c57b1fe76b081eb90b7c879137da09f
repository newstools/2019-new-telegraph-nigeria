The Nigeria Democratic Congress Party (NDCP) has made known its stand about the much talked about plan of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to deregister some political parties, saying the exercise will amount to illegality as it says the body lacks the power to carry out such exercise. In a statement signed by its National Organising Secretary, Ayokunle Oguntoye, the party called on the leadership of INEC not to toy with such idea, that its consequences will not augur well.  “I will advise Professor Mahmood and his team not to think of deregistering any political party and if they are already thinking about it, they should drop it because aside the fact that its consequences won’t be palatable, it will eventually amount to a total waste of time. INEC should rather begin to work on how it will organise credible and better elections for Nigerians in the future.  ‘“INEC will forever be held legally hostage from deregistering any party because of the inability of some governors to conduct local government elections, which is required by the amended constitution before INEC can decide to deregister any party that did not win a local government or a councillorship seat or score some percentage in local government election,” Oguntoye said. Speaking further he added: “Parties that did not win seats cannot be deregistered, going by the provision of the same law INEC wants to rely on.
