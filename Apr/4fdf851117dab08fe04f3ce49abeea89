Rights activist and Executive Director, One Love Foundation, a nongovernmental organisation based in Edo State, Mr. Patrick Eholor, has engaged the services of three senior advocates of Nigeria (SANs) and 24 other lawyers to drag commercial banks across the country to court over unbearable and irreconcilable ‘indiscriminate charges’ on customers.  Eholor told newsmen in Benin, the state capital, that banks ‘excessive and irresponsible’ charges cannot be allowed to continue, given the plight of hapless citizens who were daily deprived of several millions without anyone to their rescue. He said the action of the banks can be compared to that of a failed government or state.  According to him, having observed the failure of banks’ regulatory bodies to address these abnormalities, he took it upon himself to challenge their action in court. “They (banks) have been a problem and have undermined our patience, the same way the governments have abused the mentality of most Nigerians.  They charge excessively and irresponsibly; this does not happen in civilized societies. They introduce all sorts of charges, which they never told us when opening the accounts. “I am not speaking for myself, but for all those who do not have the voice to speak up. They rip us up in the name of charges just the same way they also rip us up with high interest charges if at all it dawns on them to give us loan.  “This is going to be the mother of all litigation; I have engaged the services of three SANs and 24 lawyers to execute this,” Eholor said.
