The increasing rate of operations carried out by armed bandits in Zamfara State, has been said to be affecting the unconditional Cash Transfer Programme (CTP), put in place by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), to encourage enrollment of children especially girls, into school.  Through the programme, UNICEF and the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID), disburse N8, 000 to the children and their caregivers every term, and evidences show that the programme has succeeded in an increased school enrollment and retention of children, especially girls.  The CTP project implementation unit coordinator for Zamfara State, Maryam Shantali, made this known yesterday in Birnin-Kebbi, during a media dialogue on Cash Transfers Empower Families; Improve Girls Empowerment in Schools’ organised by UNICEF.  While noting that the CTP was targetted at 14 rural communities under three local government areas with the highest number of out of school children, she lamented that some of the communities where the CTP was activated has been destroyed by armed bandits, causing the beneficiaries to seek refuge in neighbouring communities, including those not captured in the programme Shantali disclosed that despite the heavy presence of security agents and assurances of protection from the local government authorities and traditional rulers, members of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) have been making disbursements to the few beneficiaries who turn up to collect their money in fear.
