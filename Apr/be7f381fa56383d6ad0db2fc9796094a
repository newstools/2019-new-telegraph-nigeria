The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has raised an alarm that the All Progressives Congress (APC) wants to implicate Senator Ademola Adeleke for certificate forgery. The party noted that the arrest of the principal, Ede Muslim High School, Ede, Mr. Kadili Adejare Abass and wife of the school’s Registrar, Mrs. Rofiyat Oladepo and her nine months old baby, was orchestrated by APC to unsettle Adeleke from retrieving his governorship mandate at the court. PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, at a press conference yesterday, stated that the Assistant Inspector General (AIG) zone II, Oshogbo, Adeleye Oyebade, disclosed that the force would continue with the criminal aspect of the civil action commenced by the APC, in court. He described as unfortunate that the Nigeria Police would allow certain elements within its ranks to yield themselves as tools in the hands of the “APC in their desperation to thwart the mandate of the people of Osun State, which they freely gave to Senator Ademola Adeleke.” Ologbondiyan stated that there was no way a school principal, who duly signed and issued a school testimonial under his own hand.
