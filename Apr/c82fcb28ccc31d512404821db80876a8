The Court of Appeal, Abuja division, yesterday nullified the conviction of a former Chief of Transformation and Innovation at the Nigerian Army Headquarters, Major General Ibrahim Sani by a Special Military Court Martial. The court, in a unanimous judgment of a three-man panel of Justices led by Justice Abubakar Datti Yahaya, invalidated the courtmartial proceedings that resulted in the conviction of the appellant. The judgement of the Court was sequel to an appeal marked: CA/A/791/2017, which Sani filed to challenge the sentence that demoted him from Major General to Brigadier General. The court held that the totality of evidence that was adduced before it indicated that the appellant was denied fair hearing in the trial process that took place at the Army Headquarters Garrison, Mogadishu Cantonment, Asokoro, Abuja. The Court also held that the entire proceedings of the Special Court were conducted in a manner that breached and denied the appellant his right to a fair hearing. According to the court: “The proceedings and judgment of the special court-martial in respect of charge No: NA/ COAS/GI/39/16 filed before the lower Special Court Martial is hereby set aside. “An order is made for the retrial of the charges against the appellant by another Special Court Martial.” Specifically, the Special Military Court Martial, led by Air Vice Marshal (AVM), Gbum (NAF/1366), delivered the judgment that was set aside by the appellate court on July 20, 2017. The appellant was arraigned on July 4, 2016, on a nine-count charge that followed alleged fraudulent role he played in the management of a large parcel of land allocated to the Nigerian Army in Asokoro, Abuja.
