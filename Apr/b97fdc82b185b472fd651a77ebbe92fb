Super Eagles’ coach, Gernot Rohr, is keeping tabs on his team’s Group B rivals at this year’s Africa Cup of Nations, and the Franco-German gaffer plans to monitor upcoming build-up matches scheduled for two of the first round rivals, Guinea and Burundi. Feelers from Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) indicate that the soccer governing body is privy to Rohr’s plans to ensure the Eagles’ crew have someone to watch Guinea and Burundi in their proposed friendlies with Egypt and Tunisia respectively. Although nothing has been said about also monitoring Madagascar, the third Group B team the Eagles will be up against in June, elaborate plans have already been launched for Rohr or one of his aides to be in the stands when Guinea face Egypt at Borg Al Arab Stadium on June 16. However, Burundi’s date against Tunisia is yet to be fixed, despite the AFCON debutants disclosing that they already have an agreement to face the 2004 winners before Egypt 2019 begins on June 21. Burundi’s match with Tunisia might be of more importance to Rohr, as his team will play the newcomers first in their Group B campaign at Egypt 2019, as they will both lock horns on June 22 in Alexandria. Rohr’s side will then tackle Guinea in their second group match and end the first round assault against Madagascar, who are also newcomers to the continental soccer showpiece. Additional information from the NFF revealed that Rohr is still hoping to secure a friendly with either Burkina Faso or Benin Republic, as part of his preparation for the 2019 AFCON. A fixture for the Eagles against either The Stallions or Squirrels would come in place of Ghana, who declined an earlier invitation for a friendly game, while the NFF has already confirmed that Rohr’s team will face Senegal in Ismailia, Egypt, prior to the start of the 2019 AFCON in June.
