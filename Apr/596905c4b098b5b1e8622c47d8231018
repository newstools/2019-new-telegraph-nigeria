The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) yesterday arraigned a suspected internet fraudster, Eniola Odeneye, over alleged fraud of $3,300. The suspect, brought before Justice Mohammed Abubakar of the Federal High Court, Abeokuta, was arraigned by the EFCC Ibadan Zonal Office on a one-count charge bordering on obtaining money by false pretence. The offence is contrary to Section 1 (1) (a) and punishable under Section 1 (3) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act, 2006. The suspect was said to have defrauded one Chris, an American citizen, of the sum of $3,300, by posing online as a woman. The count read: “That you Odeneye Eniola, sometimes in 2019, at Awa Ijebu within the jurisdiction of this court with intent to defraud, obtain the sum of $ 3300 USD from Chris, an American citizen when you falsely represented to him that you are a woman, which facilitated your collecting money from him through iTunes and play Gift Cards, which representation you knew to be false and thereby committed an offense contrary to section 1(1)(a) and punishable under Section 1 (3) of the Advance Fee Fraud and other Fraud Related Offenses Act 2006.” The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. Due to his ‘not guilty’ plea, the prosecution counsel, Shamsudden Bahir, prayed the court for a trial date and an order to remand him in prison custody pending the determination of his case.
