ASUU: 73 private varsities have less than 5% of total undergraduates  NUC: Setback not enough to stop issuance of licences  Ex-VC: NUC should maintain existing varsities  CAUTION Key players in the nation’s university system have called on policy makers, especially the National Universities Commission (NUC), to suspend approval of private universities in order for the existing ones to consolidate  With the declaration by the National Universities Commission (NUC) that applications of 303 private universities are being processed for approval, critical stakeholders in the education sector for umpteenth times, have called for caution in the way the Federal Government is approving the establishment of private universities in the country.  This is as stakeholders, such as the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and members of the academia within the country and in the Diaspora warned that if cautions were not urgently taken, the proliferation of private universities, especially when many of the existing ones are yet to stand on their feet, might further jeopadise the quality of university education in the nation.  According to the stakeholders, rather than paying attention on the establishment of new universities, concerted efforts should be intensified by the government and the proprietors of the private institutions to consolidate more on improving and repositioning the existing universities through adequate funding and running of relevant courses of study based on the needs of the country in line with the 21st Century challenges.  NUC had last week announced that the agency superintending university education in Nigeria is processing applications for 303 private universities, saying the applications for the proposed universities were from faith-based organisations, group of individuals, foundations and corporation organisations.  The NUC Executive Secretary, Prof. Abubakar Rasheed disclosed this in a paper entitled: “Regulating Private University Education Delivery in Nigeria: The Role of The National Universities Commission,” he delivered at a two-day national sum-   mit on private universities in Abuja.  He said: “Only two out of the 303 applications had attained Step 10 and awaiting licence; 208 applications on Step 3 for having only collected the forms; 63 applications on Step 6 as they had only submitted their completed application forms and awaiting first verification visit, while 30 applications are on Step 8.”  However, Rasheed wondered that majority of the existing private universities were still unable to meet their admission quotas or carrying capacity as all the 73 private universities in the country could barely admit six per cent of the total university admissions per session.  Despite this, he said the setback was not enough to stop the issuance of licences for the establishment of private universities as the country needed more universities to cope with the high demand for university education.   On his part, the Minister of Education, Malam Adamu Adamu, recalled that there was a huge expansion in the Nigerian university system through the application of private resources, rising from 30 universities in 1996 to 170 universities in 2019. As a way forward, the Minister, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Education, Sonny Echono urged the institutions to tackle the various challenges, including improper staffing, excessive proprietor influence and inadequate funding, among others, bedeviling them.  This was even as he asked operators of private universities to adhere to admission requirements, address their inability to fill their admission quota, adhere to NUC’s extant guidelines and regulations, good university governance, as well as adequate and sustainable funding. But, the NUC’s declaration has since continued to attract attention and generate reactions among key players and stakeholders.  While many criticised and condemned what they described as proliferation of private universities, some hailed it as a right step to address the admission gaps in the system and access to university education for the teeming students seeking admission yearly without corresponding space in the over 170 universities (federal, state and private) in the country.   Specifically, over 1.8 million candidates sat for the just-concluded Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), conducted by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), in which last than 500,000 are offered university admission at the end of the day.  But, firing the first salvo, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) expressed dismay over NUC’s push to establish new private universities, when many of the existing ones are failing due to lack of adequate funding and low enrolment subscription.   This was as the union’s National President, Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi condemned any move to establish new private universities, insisting that ASUU had always argued that proliferation of private universities would not solve the twin problems of access and quality of university education in the country.  According to ASUU, “Rather, we are convinced that it will compound the problems. Indeed, we have been proved right by some recent trends in the country.”   ASUU National President, who in an exclusive chat with New Telegraph, regretted that private universities in the country were being run as investments or business ventures, unlike other climes where there are many non-profit universities owned by religious bodies and philanthropic organisations, however, wondered that most of the private universities were established for profit motives.   Meanwhile, Ogunyemi hinted that a statistics from the 2018 survey by the NUC had actually shown that the number of students in the existing 73 private universities is less than five per cent of the total undergraduates in the entire Nigerian university system.   Recalling ASUU’s long-held position that public universities should be the primary focus for increased access and qualitative university education, Ogunyemi noted that more than 70 per cent of the private universities would fissile out and the rat race for establishing private universities would cease if public universities are adequately fixed.   The ASUU President said: “The so-called private sector in Nigeria is parasitic and corrupt. “These private universities operators have continued with their “nofailure” policy, principal dependence on part-time and/or unqualified lecturers, rapid turn-over through short lecturehour contacts and boosting of class of degrees to advertise the marketability of their products.   These and many other unethical practices will surely lower the quality of university education. Ogunyemi, said the only way to address this is for federal and state governments to squarely address the multi-dimensional problems of public universities as ASUU has consistently argued, noting that private universities have kept university education beyond the reach of poor Nigerian children, where over 60 per cent Nigerians live below the poverty line.   Therefore, he said ASUU would    continue to challenge the logic of proliferation of private universities by NUC as the only solution to the access and quality challenges of the Nigerian university system.  Also, worried by the development, a former Vice-Chancellor of Ekiti State University (EKSU), Prof. Dipo Kolawole, said the number of universities (170) in Nigeria currently should be maintained for at least the next decade in order to sustain and improve their standard and quality. While criticising NUC for its thirst to licence new private universities, the don warned that any further licensing of more universities would make a mockery of Nigerian university system.   “In my opinion, some private universities have enhanced the quality of education, while many others, pathetically have lowered standard and compromised the essence of university education,” Kolawole added. Meanwhile, as a way out, he said NUC should wake up to its responsibility as a regulatory mechanism of university education, regretting that for now the commission has failed in that responsibility.   The former Vice-Chancellor noted that “the fact that NUC receives applications does not compel granting of licence, saying: “It is good to democratise education, but over democratisation for political balancing is detrimental to national growth and development.  Similarly, the former Dean, Faculty of Education, University of Lagos (UNILAG), Prof. Duro Ajeyalemi, in his brief comments, said establishment of universities would not necessarily bring down the standard of university education in the country, if the NUC does its screening efficiently. Piqued by the NUC’s position, the Dean of Faculty of Arts, University of Ibadan (UI), Prof. Ademola Dasylva, wondered when the nation’s policy makers would ever get things right in the education sector.  According to him, the argument of the NUC has always been that existing universities in Nigeria could not accommodate thousands of qualified candidates, who seek admission into the Nigerian universities yearly.  But, he expressed worry that with about 60 per cent of the Nigerian universities being privately owned, have far less than 10 per cent of the total students in all the universities in the country put together. Therefore, he insisted that approving more private universities would not be the best solution to the myriad of challenges confronting the system, saying, therefore, that the fire brigade approach which is characteristic of policy makers, could only further compound the challenges.  Dasylva, who called for a well-informed and definite process of managing the university sector, noted that apart from the first generation universities, five or six state universities, and about eight private universities that have a semblance of what a standard university looks like in terms of infrastructure, programmes, quality teaching and administrative personnel, conducive environment for teaching, learning and research, the rest so-called universities in Nigeria are a big joke, and worse still, a big fraud.  While lamenting how every state governor turned the establishment of state university to constituency project to score a political point, regardless of whether or not the state has the financial muscle to run a standard university, described many, if not most of the state universities, as glorified high schools.  The don said: “The second wave of the malady is that having a private university has suddenly become a status symbol, a competition among the politicians many of whom have no clue as to what it means and what it takes to run a truly standard university.  Many of the private universities engage in fraudulent acts, always window- dressing anytime there is NUC visitation and accreditation with false library, rented lecturers and facilities. Fraud and corruption are everywhere, and we insist on maintaining global standard.  It is a joke.” Dasylva, who said the operators charge high school fees, which are justifiably considering the fact that they have to meet NUC benchmarks on programmes, teaching and supporting personnel, infrastructure, research and learning environment, still lamented that many proprietors established universities without knowing the nitty-gritty of what standard entails.  On the quality of some of the university, the Professor of African Literature, wondered that many of the private universities are churning out First Class degrees in order to enjoy increased patronage.   However, on the way out, the don insisted that the solution is not in increasing the number of private universities, rather NUC should ensure improved funding in order to guarantee quality teaching and research, employment of adequate qualified teaching personnel and expand the existing infrastructure, as well as the learning environment in the public universities, in order to accommodate more students.  Besides, he urged the government to pay attention to other tertiary institutions such as polytechnics, monotechnics and colleges of education by making their programmes more attractive, and guarantee quality prospects for their products. “Thatway, thepressureof demand onuniversitieswilldrasticallyreduce, and we all can begin to witness a new dawninourtertiaryeducationsector,” Dasylva added.  Consequently, the former Vice- Chancellor of Adekunle Ajasin University and a lecturer at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Prof. Femi Mimiko, said the country could still admit many universities, given its increasing population.  Mimiko, a Professor of Political Economy at the Department Political Science, said:“Weareacountryof close to200millionpeople, morethanhalf of themareof schoolgoingage. Everyyear, closetotwomillioncandidatessitforthe Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, out of which only a quarter is placed.”  Specifically, he noted that from the point of view of access, the country definitely needs more universities, but reiterated that the newer universities need not, all of them, attempt to run the full range of courses available in the older ones.  But, as part of the way out, the don further suggested: “I would rather Nigeria has more of the new universities specialising on one, or a few courses. Secondly, I think NUC needs to do a little more in forcing out of the new universities a commitment to sponsor trainee-academics for graduate studies in older universities at home and abroad.  “This is necessary so that we do not just set up new universities without regard to how the doctorate degree holders that would teach in them would be produced. There is the need to professionalise university governance in order to improve overall quality of administration.  According to Mimiko, if NUC pays attention to the foregoing, the nation could license new universities; and of course that does not preclude the government from committing more funds to expand the existing federal and state universities to create more access. Ultimately, he argued that opening more universities would not necessarily compromise quality provided all concerned stakeholders do the needful.  But, on his part, a Nigerian don and Professor of African History at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A, Prof. Moses Ebe Ochonu, however, raised the alarm over the proliferation of private universities in Nigeria, describing it as “scandalous.”  “To say I was alarmed when I read the news would be an understatement. It is scandalous. My question, however, is what would be the trajectory or envisaged endpoint of such a fight either to get the NUC to not accept so many applications or approve many,” he said.  However, the don noted the NUC’s logic was that the demand for higher education far outstrips supply and hence private universities are a way to fill the gap, added that although, the logic of demand and supply could also sound on the face of it, with its populist appeal, therefore, the fight should focus more on radically revising the minimum requirements for approval of a private university.   According to Ochonu, the Cornelius Vanderbilt Chair in History since 2017, one would not be able to establish a small community college in the United States with the resources and facilities that the NUC requires of potential private universities in Nigeria. Worried by the NUC’s requirements, the don hinted that establishment of universities requires much higher standards, facilities, and human capital from the outset as the way to go.  Similarly, given the current proliferation of private universities, Dr. Olajumoke Yacob-Haliso, Dean, Faculty of Social Science, Babcock University, Ilishan-Remo, Ogun State, also frowned at the rate at which private universities are springing up in the country, saying that 95 per cent of the existing universities are seriously undersubscribed and could hardly muster a total of 500 students on their campuses.  He said: “90 per cent of the existing university could hardly pay salaries monthly, using the Federal Government scale; 95 per cent of them could not manage a research agenda alongside their existential problems; 95 per cent have serious infrastructural deficits, while 98 per cent have no reputation both internally and externally.
