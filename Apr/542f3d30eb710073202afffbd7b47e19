The Federal Government yesterday launched the Maternal and Perinatal Death and Surveillance Response and Quality Equity Dignify (MPD4QED) to capture the data of mothers and babies around pregnancies and deliveries. Minister of Health, Prof. Isaac Adewole, said the data collection programme was aimed at determining the cause of death involving mothers and babies, to enable the government healthcare facilities take appropriate measure to avoid and prevent such deaths in future. Represented by the Director, Family Planning and Health, Dr. Adebayo Adebiyi, the minister noted that the MPD4QED programme would help harmonise all data collection platforms for adequate and reliable data integration. Defending various policies and programmes launched on yearly basis by the Federal Government, Adewole said there were various emerging health issues that must be addressed. He stressed that Nigeria must wake up to the occasion and begin to develop localised policies that were peculiar to her. Representative of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Mr. Clement Peter, noted that MPD4QED would achieve a data base system that was inter-linked with the existing systems and user friendly to inform decisions in addressing the immediate causes of maternal mortality in the hospitals. “Our hospitals has existing data base, but what we are bringing forth is standardised variables that can be comparable in product that are more linked to other data collection tools simple to use and help those in the hospitals also help to do simple analysis,” he said.
