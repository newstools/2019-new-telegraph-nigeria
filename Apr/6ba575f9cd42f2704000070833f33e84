The Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Major-General Suleiman Kazaure, yesterday described Bayelsa State as one of the volatile states in terms of insecurity in the country.

He urged the military, police and other critical stakeholders in the security architecture to support the NYSC for the safety of the corps members in the state.

Why I am making this request is because you are critical stakeholders when it comes to security. Please, look after our children, there are our national assets; we discovered that Bayelsa State is volatile when it comes to insecurity.”  In his remarks, Major- General Obinna Onubogu, Commander of the 16 Brigade, represented by Lt.-Col.
