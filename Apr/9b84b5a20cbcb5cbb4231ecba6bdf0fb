A mild drama is currently brewing within the premises of an Ikeja High Court,  as operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) have laid siege in the bid to arrest a former Federal High Court Judge,  Justice Rita Ofili Ajumogobia . Justice Hakeem Oshodi had earlier struck out the 30 count charge bordering on corruption and abuse of office by a public officer against Ajumogobia,  describing it as a waste of judicial time. The Judge went on further to blast the EFCC,  pointing out that they out to have asked that the case be struck out based on an appeal court judgement in favour of another judge accused of corruption. Oshodi accused EFCC of leading the court on while going ahead to call more witnesses. Ajumogobia who wore a leg cast on her right leg,  had proceeded out of the court but fled back upstairs into the court when she saw armed operatives of the commission who were waiting to arrest her. The Judge is currently holed up inside the court,  while the operatives are outside the door waiting to arrest her.
