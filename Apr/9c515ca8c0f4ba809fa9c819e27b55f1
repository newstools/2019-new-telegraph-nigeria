Chairman Nigeria Beach Volleyball, Musa Nimrod, says Nigeria is ready to host the 2019 Africa Nations Seniors Beach Volleyball Cup this month.
The tournament is scheduled to take place from April 21 to 28, 2019 at Jabi Lake Park, Abuja, Nigeria. Nimrod who doubles as the President of Nigeria Volleyball Federation told journalists that the nation accepted to host the competition due to its consistency in beach volleyball on the continent. “I want to tell the world that all is set for Nigeria to host the tournament. It is also my joy to see the country host an Africa championship because the nation has been consistent in the game for over a decade,” Nimrod said.
He said the federation was working round the clock in order to ensure the championship is a success. “Last year, the country hosted the U-21 Africa Men’s Championship and we got good commendation from CAVB for it.
