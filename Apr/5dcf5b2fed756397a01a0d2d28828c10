Al-Nassr of Saudi Arabia striker, Ahmed Musa, has admitted he was relieved on Thursday to finally end a run that saw him pass through five months without scoring for his club. In what appeared as a huge slump, after his bright start to life in the oil-rich Middle East country, Musa went on a barren run that dated back to November 2018, when he last scored in the Saudi Professional League. However, all that changed on Thursday, as Musa ended his 13-game goal drought with a brace in Al Nassr’s 5-0 thrashing of Al Fateh; much to the delight of the former Kano Pillars, VV Venlo of Holland, CSKA Moscow of Russia and Leicester City of England star. After enduring a frustrating spell since his last strike against Al Shabab, Musa was glad to help Rui Vitoria’s men bag their 20th victory, as he doubled the lead in the 38th minute at Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium. After providing an assist for Hamdallah’s brace, Musa wrapped up the emphatic win with his second goal in the 78th minute, which took his haul to seven in 22 league outings, and moved Al Nassr top of the topflight table with 64 points from 28 matches. Musa will now turn his focus to the AFC Champions League, with a game against Al Zawra’a of Iraq on Tuesday before the Saudi King’s Cup clash against Al Ittihad on Saturday, April 27.
