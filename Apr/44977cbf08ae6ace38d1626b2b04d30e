Udinese of Italy defender, William Troost-Ekong, says switching allegiance from the Netherlands to Nigeria was his best career decision ever. The 25-year-old, who so far has 30 caps, was born in the Netherlands to a Dutch mother and Nigerian father and has represented the European nation at youth level before switching allegiance to Nigeria. After winning an Olympic football bronze medal in 2016 and playing at the 2018 World Cup, the centreback is looking forward to the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations with the Super Eagles. “I think the decision to play for Nigeria has to be the best ever for me,” Troost-Ekong told BBC Sport. “We have some amazing and talented players in Nigeria and to get a chance to play for a great country like ours is an honour and immense privilege. “You cannot force anyone to choose Nigeria, you must love the country and be committed to it or you don’t brother. “Personally, I will be grateful for the opportunity and everything Nigeria has given to my career. “I’ve fulfilled some dreams by playing at the Olympic Games and on the biggest stage [World Cup] in Russia, now I look forward to living another dream by playing at the Africa Cup of Nations.”
