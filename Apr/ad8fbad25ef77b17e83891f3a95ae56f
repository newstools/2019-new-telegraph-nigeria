Nessa felt very uneasy as she watched Tume stroke himself. Although she pretended to be asleep, her eyes were not fully closed. Her body was also very far from slumberland. Her honeypot twitched with passion which she tried to rein in with difficulty. She felt like stroking herself too, but didn’t because the slightest move would give her away. She watched her hubby work himself to orgasm and played with herself in her mind. Somehow, it worked, for she felt herself floating…   Tume was so engrossed with himself that he was oblivious of his surrounding. His mind travelled years back to his university days. He was in his room with his roommate, TT, a mutual friend, Alani, who went by the nickname, Alarm, and two other friends.  They were engrossed in their favourite game which they tagged, ‘No pocketing’. It was a mind game in which the participants watch adult movies with full concentration. The catch was that their penistuses were expected not to react to the passion-raising moves of the professional actors. Of course, it would take great will power for mere mortal not to stir while watching the film. There was always an umpire who would sit opposite the participants and ensure they didn’t close their eyes to the blue action on the screen.  Also, the volume of the television would be tuned low enough not to draw the attention of students outside the room, but loud enough to mess up with the participants’ minds if they, per chance, stared at the edges of the screen as some were wont to do.  The game got its name from the rule that none of the participants was expected to dip his hands into his pockets for one could cheat by stroking himself inside the pocket. At the end of the film, the participants would stand up and raise their hands above their heads.  The umpire would inspect their Johnnies. Only on rare occasions did a clear winner emerge, for all the unruly penituses, which, by the way, were encased in mandatory loose boxers, would be standing at an attention like policemen on parade, threatening to burst open <img class="size-medium wp-image-201765 alignleft" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sweet-smelling-evil-6.png?resize=300%2C162&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="162" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sweet-smelling-evil-6.png?resize=300%2C162&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sweet-smelling-evil-6.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1">the fabrics inside which they were imprisoned.  “No pocketing,” the umpire would warn as he would move and inspect them. Tume smiled. At the end of the game, after the losers had laughed away their losses, they would stroke themselves and play ‘first to pour’.  Tume smiled again as he worked himself into a frenzy. “Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh,” he moaned as his body twitched and he shot his load into the air and watched the creamy juice rain back on his fingers…  Nessa, eyes wide open now, felt her body vibrate as she watched her hubby shiver. Her mouth opened wide to shout but she was able to restrain herself as passion rocked her own body. She felt herself juicing.  Tume, who seemed to suddenly remember she was there, turned and looked at her. However, she was quick enough to close her eyes and pretend to be sleeping while the slippery juice tickling out of her honeypot tickled her. She remained in that position for a while and somehow slipped into genuine slumber afterwards…  The next morning, Tume took her to her office in the morning to drop her resignation letter. She had taken the pain to explain why she had to stop work without notice. Of course, her boss was very understanding.  “My dear, after marriage, the next thing people expect to see is a protruding tummy. If the tummy doesn’t shoot out after the first few months, tongues will wag. I understand. You need all the rest you can get after nine years of waiting. We will miss you but we will be happy to attend your child’s dedication in a few months time.   Your husband called me yesterday afternoon to explain the situation to me…” her boss told her. That was news to Nessa. “He called you yesterday?” She asked. “Yes, I did, my love. I called her when we left the doctor’s office,” Tume told her. “One other thing Nessa, you remain a member of this family. You always have a job waiting for you in Tradecom when you’re ready to go back to work,” her boss said. “Oh! Thank you ma’am…”  Nessa gushed as she hugged her boss. “Thank you madam. My wife and I appreciate,” Tume said and extended his hand for a handshake. That handshake did something to him. Something akin to an electric current passed through him. He felt his blood rush downward and the snake moved. He held on to the woman’s palm a tad longer and scanned her face briefly, but saw nothing. It was either the woman was naive or a very good actress.  “I am in a serious trouble,” Tume thought to himself. That was in the morning. Tume had gone to work and Nessa had gone to the market to do some shopping. She might not be doing that in a very long while because Tume told her that he’d be taking charge of everything until they were able to get a house help.  “My love, nothing must go wrong this time around. We must do everything right. If needs be, we will get mama to come stay with us to help out,” Tume told her that morning. Nessa was happy, having her mother in-law around would be great, but mama was diabetic and needed to be taken care of also. “No, we can’t have mama stay with us when I cannot take care of her. You know she’ll not give herself a moment’s rest. I can’t have her stress herself out now.  I’ll rather have her come around when I have the baby,” she told her husband. “Hmmmmmmm…, Tume will spoil me silly. That is certain,” Nessa smiled as she recalled what happened that morning. She had read so much about love, but never believed it could be so true and sweet. It was time to get into the kitchen. Tume would soon be back and Tami would be visiting after Bible study. They both would be very hungry. She smiled and walked into the kitchen.   The Egusi soup on the gas was almost ready when she heard, “a knock at the door.” She woke up with a start. She had dozed off on the couch and had prepared the Egusi soup in her dream! Haaa! It was past 5pm. Tume would be back soon and she hadn’t prepared dinner. The knocks were real. Someone was at the door.  She reluctantly sat up. “Kai, I feel so lazy. I really need a help,” she muttered to herself and moved to the door. She peeped, saw Tami and opened the door. “Praise God,” Tami screamed as the two friends embrace.  “Congrats babes. You will have this baby in Jesus name. I prayed for you. I told you it could be pregnancy that made you sick up whatever you ate that day! I called dad and he told me you’ve already spoken with him. I’m so happy for you and Tume…” the words tumbled out as they both walked back to the couch.   “Babe, you’re a doctor o. You said it. Thank God. The doctor confirmed it yesterday. He said I need to take things easy until I have this baby,” Nessa told her friend. “You think I’ll allow you to do anything? I’ve taken over o. Just tell me how I can be of help to you and it is done,” Nessa told her friend, adding, “Meanwhile, I’m hungry”. “I haven’t prepared anything…or rather, I was making a very delicious pot of Egusi soup in my dream before you woke me up now. I feel so lazy and Tume will soon be back,” Nessa answered, trying to keep a straight face and failed. They laughed and Tami moved to the kitchen.   “There’s stew…hmmmmm yummy yummy aroma. I’ll prepare rice,” she said. “For three,” Nessa replied and settled back on the couch. But after a few minutes, she joined her friend in the kitchen. “Babes, something is bothering me,” she told her friend. Tami looked up sharply. She was draining the rice.  “What is it? Spill it,” she urged her friend. “Doctor said I should take things easy. I shouldn’t engage in bedroom games,” she said. “So, will the world end? It’s expected that you don’t overlabour yourself,” Tami told her. “No, you don’t understand. It’s not about me. You know Tume and sex. What if he seeks fun outside? The worrying part is that he’s not even bothered…”  She emptied her mind. Of course, Tami understood. She felt for her friend and was full of encouragement for her. She advised Nessa to concentrate on her pregnancy and not to worry about her husband and she meant it. She had always respected her friend’s husband. Tume was randy, but that was before. A knock on the door and the two friends looked at each other and smiled.  Tume unlocked the door and walked in. “I would have been surprised if you two were not together. Now, what’s cooking?” he asked as he moved towards them in the kitchen. He hugged his wife and planted a kiss on her lips.  He turned to Tami and said, “Tami, how are you? Hope work wasn’t too strenuous today,” and gave her a peck on her cheeks. “Welcome my love. You’re lucky Tami is around. We would have eaten the food I prepared in my dream. She just helped in preparing dinner,” Nessa told her husband. “Lazy bone.  The doctor just gave you a licence to get lazier,” he said laughing and turned to Tami, “Sorry dear, my wife has turned you to a cook. Be ready to add more back-breaking chores to you office work.”  “Tume bad mouth! You want to yab abi? I’ve not eaten, so I don’t have strength to laugh now,” Tami replied. “Don’t mind the clown. He’s looking for a way to dodge the chores he’ll have to take on until the doctor certifies me fit to work again,” Nessa said and they all laughed.  “Me dodge any chore? You know I won’t. You will beg me to stop because I will do everything you want me to do…,” he said aloud, and muttered, “and more.” He remembered that awkward moment with Nessa’s boss.  “That woman would lead many men to the lake of fire. Kai! A provoked trousers snake has no conscience!”  Food was ready and they moved to the dinette. After dinner, they watched a film. A few minutes later, Tami was ready to go home. “Babes, I have to leave. I have to attend Laide’s wedding tomorrow. Will see you after.  Tume, take care of my sister,” Tami said, standing up. “Thanks sis. Get me ‘gist’ from the wedding. I’m in detention now,” Nessa replied, and they all laughed.  They walked Tami to the bus stop and watched her board a cab. Some days later, Tami saw Tume driving into an exclusive guesthouse with a lady.  She never said a word of it to her friend, though. After some time, it became regular a thing to see her friend’s husband with girls.  Alarmed, she wondered, “What if one of these girls eats deep into his heart?  ***  Did Tami squeal on him? Let’s continue this journey on Sunday!  ######   •Send your observations to: julietbumah@gmail.com      Tami felt like a woman once again. She moaned loudly as he dived in and out of her pot with his tongue. The sound of the rain on the roof became a sweet, relaxing rhythm on her mind. She didn’t want him to stop. She also didn’t want the rain… In “Body & Soul” Before this pregnancy, Nessa had four miscarriages, which came in quick successions. After the last miscarriage five years ago, she went from one pastor to another for prayers. She spent a fortune on many merchants of prayers. One day, she went to see a man of the gods who… In “Intellectual Masturbation” Tume raised his eyebrows and squinted at Tami, willing her to communicate with him in sign language. But Tami stared at him, eyes misty with tears. He could read nothing from her blank stare. His heart fluttered and he had a sudden headache and swayed. He wanted to bolt,… In “Body & Soul”
