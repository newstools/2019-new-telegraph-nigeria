 Police yesterday arrested two men in connection with the abduction of the Director of the Lagos State Fire Service, Rasaki Musibau. Their arrest came after operatives of the Anti-Kidnapping Unit of the Lagos State Police Command reportedly rescued Musibau and six other victims. The arrest followed sustained and well-coordinated operations by the command’s tactical teams, led by the Officer in Charge (OC) of Anti-Kidnapping Unit, a Superintendent of Police (SP), Bulus Musa.
According to the police, the two suspects were members of the kidnapping gang who attacked seven people, including Musibau, on Saturday about 8p.m. In a statement, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Bala Elkana, identified the suspects as identified as Blessing Bayo (29) and Smart Alfred (32), all of Arogbo, Ondo State. He said: “They were arrested about 5.30a.m. at Ibafun on Ikorodu-Ijebu-Ode Expressway, a boundary community with Ogun State. They all confessed to the commission of the crime. Two single-barrelled guns were recovered from them. Investigation is ongoing, while efforts are emplaced to arrest other fleeing members of the gang. ” Elkana said that on Tuesday about 11.45p.m., tactical teams were able to combat the hoodlums and release the victims.
The PPRO said the victims had since been reunited with their families. But, according to him, the command’s tactical teams are still in the creeks and forests, combating the hoodlums.
He said: “Water-tight security measures are emplaced across the state to forestall future occurrence. The command deeply appreciates the support of government and the good people of Lagos State who stood by us and also provided useful information that facilitated the prompt rescue of the victims. Together we will continue to make Lagos State one of the safest states in Nigeria.
“The suspects all confessed to the commission of the crime.”
