An Ekiti State High Court, Ido Ekiti Judicial Division, has declared Iludun community as owner of disputed land which had over the years pitched the community against some individuals who had claimed ownership of the contentious land. The court in a judgement said the territory which was a communal land belonged to the entire Iludun community in Ilejemeje local government area of the state. Delivering judgment in a suit No. HID/8/2017 filed by Rev. David Adeosun and five others on behalf of themselves and their families against the Owa of Iludun Ekiti, Oba Kayode Akinola, and three others over the ownership of Agamo land, Justice Adekunle Adegoriola Adeleye held that right and title to Agamo land was vested in the Iludun community. Justice Adeleye said: “I find as a fact that the claimants are not the first settlers at Agamo and therefore not owners of the land in dispute. Agamo belongs to the Iludun indigenes as a communal land since the land has not been partitioned. This is a fact pleaded, and led in evidence by the counterclaimants, but not disproven by the defendants. “Consequently, a reigning Owa of Iludun is entrusted with the management custody, control and supervision of the Agamo farmland in conjunction with other principal or prominent indigenes of the town for the benefit of the entire community.”
