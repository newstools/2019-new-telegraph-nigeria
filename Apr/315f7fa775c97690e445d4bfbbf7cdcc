The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has denied the allegation that he paid $30,000 to hire a US lobby group to persuade the American Congress to stop the inauguration of President Muhammadu Buhari. Atiku, in a statement yesterday by his media adviser, Paul Ibe, described such allegation from Buhari campaign group as “total fabrication”, and a dirty propaganda against him. He however said he was not surprised by the group’s allegation “because lying has so far become their only bragging rights of competence.  “Lying has become a culture to the APC administration and therefore, we are not surprised by their latest diversionary allegations.”  According to the statement: “Since Atiku resisted pressure not to go to court, the APC has been behaving like a cat on hot bricks because the outcome of the 2019 elections has exposed and shattered the facade of their dubious integrity  Instead of fabricating fake news, Atiku advised the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate to focus on defending themselves in the court.  “For a party that has broken the worst record in election rigging, the APC doesn’t have any iota of integrity to be taken seriously by anybody,” the former vice president added. He noted that the court case has become their biggest burden because it exposed their integrity as “a sham, and instead of defending their stolen mandate in court, they are now using fake news to divert public attention from the historic electoral heist they have committed against Nigerians.”  Atiku stated that no amount of diversionary propaganda and fake news campaign by APC would stop him from continuing the court action he instituted to reclaim his alleged stolen mandate.
