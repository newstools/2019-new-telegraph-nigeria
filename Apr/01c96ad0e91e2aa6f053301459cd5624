Some youths at Gan’um village in Ofada Mokoloki Local Council Development Area of Ogun State have protested the demolition of buildings in the community by the state government. The protesters, numbering over 40, were armed with placards, with different inscriptions. Some of the inscriptions read: “Amosun please stop demolishing our property on our land,” “Federal government should stop Amosun from demolishing our houses in our community.” The buildings were demolished inside Regal Estate at Magboro by the state government. The protesters urged the Federal Government and wellmeaning Nigerians to look into what they termed illegal demolition of buildings, including churches and shops. One of the protesters, Ayeni, described the demolition as display of executive recklessness. He said: “It is a shame that a governor could just wake up one day and with less than two months left in office, descend so heavily on people whose only crime stemmed from buying plots of land in Ogun State and getting all necessary documents from the government of the same state.” Chief Nureni Farounbi, head of the family which owns the land, said the state government’s action was not only prejudicial but smacked contempt of court. He said: “It is shocking because this is not an area where we have the issue of acquired land because there was no time the topic of paying compensation came up. As you can see, there is nothing the state government has done for us; no school, no hospital, no water or electricity or even road. The electricity you see here now was as a result of money families contributed.” Ayodele Agbeleshe, one of the surveyors of the land, said there was no basis for demolishing any building in the area, saying the exercise was unjustifiable.
