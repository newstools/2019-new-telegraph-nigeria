Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Emmanuel Kachikwu, yesterday said that he had rallied the president of Saudi Aramco on talks for multi-million- dollar investment options in the mid and downstream sector of the economy.  Like Kachikwu, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said that it was in talks with different consortiums to revamp its refineries and save billions of dollars on fuel imports. Nigeria’s petroleum ministry, which declared Kachikwu’s talks with Aramco, said in a tweet yesterday that Kachikwu held talks with Saudi Arabia’s energy minister to “cement the budding interest to support Nigeria’s infrastructure development in the oil sector.”  Aramco was expanding downstream operations such as refining and petrochemicals production as part of its drive to become the world’s largest integrated energy firm. Nigeria imported the bulk of its petrol, despite being Africa’s biggest crude oil producer, due to its dilapidated refineries. Kachikwu is on an official visit to Saudi Arabia Nigeria’s petroleum ministry, on its Twitter feed, said Kachikwu and Aramco officials, including its president, discussed “areas of shared investment interests and existing viable investment options in the midstream and downstream sector of the industry.” In another tweet, it said Kachikwu held talks with Saudi Arabia’s energy minister to “cement the budding interest to sup-  port Nigeria’s infrastructure development in the oil sector.”  The talks were the latest between Nigerian and Saudi officials. In February, Nigeria’s President, Muhammadu Buhari, said his country, a member of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was willing to reduce oil output to help secure higher prices after an envoy from Saudi Arabia called for better adherence to a deal on production cuts.
