 About 150,000 barrels per day crude oil were at the weekend shut-in as fire gutted the $1.1 billion Nembs Creek Trunk Line. Operator of the installation, Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company, which confirmed this yesterday, maintained that it had placed a force majeure on the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (NCTL) due to fire outbreak. Force Majeure is a contractual term, which shows that a business commitment may not be met. Head, Corporate Communications of the company, Mr. Ndiana Mathew, who said this in a statement in Lagos, explained that the action followed information of a fire outbreak by a surveillance team composed of the Joint Task Force (JTF) and Department of State Services (DSS) around NCTL RoW near Awoba yesterday. “We are constrained to shut in injection as well as other related operations into the NCTL. “In accordance with standard procedure, we requested the other injectors to do same. The NCTL has, hitherto, enjoyed smooth operations preceding this incident,” Mathew said. The fire might, according to him, have occurred through an illegitimate, third party breach of the functionality of the pipeline, which is a critical national asset. “In the meantime, the relevant investigations are continuing while further information about the remote and direct causes of the fire will be communicated as soon as these became available. “We ask our stakeholders to await further, detailed briefing in due course.” Aiteo Group acquired OML 29 from Royal Dutch Shell and emerged as Nigeria’s leading oil and gas company. This pipeline has a capacity of 150,000 b/d at Nembe Creek; however, up to 600,000 b/d of liquids can be evacuated from the end point at Cawthorne Channel.” The construction of the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (NCTL) began in 2006 and was commissioned in 2010 at the cost of $1.1 billion.
