The main political slogan that worked in favour of former President Goodluck Jonathan in his bid to retain his seat in Aso Rock during the 2011 presidential election was “I had no shoes.” Jonathan, while declaring his intention to contest for the presidential primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on September 18, 2010 disclosed: “In my early days in school, I had no shoes, no school bags…” The statement later became popular and served as source of encouragement to many. However, the slogan “I had no shoes” triggered laughter recently during the Global Education and Summit Forum (GESF) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), when President Julius Maada Bio of Sierra Leone used it. President Bio, who was speaking on his grass to grace story, told delegates that he once had no shoes, while growing up. The slogan was also used by one of the delegates, while asking the Sierra Leonean president a question. He equally said he had no shoes, while growing up.
