Anthony Joshua’s US debut is now in jeopardy after his challenger Jarrell ‘Big Baby’ Miller reportedly failed a drug test. ESPN reported that Miller, 30, failed a doping test for banned ‘muscle growth’ substance GW1516, citing three sources with knowledge of the results. The heavyweights were due to fight on June 1 at New York’s Madison Square Garden, with Brit boxer Joshua defending his WBA, WBO and IBF heavyweight titles. The test results were reportedly from a random Voluntary Anti-Doping Association-conducted urine test Miller submitted to on March 20. Miller’s promotional team issued a short statement saying that Miller will continue to train for the fight with Joshua as they will look into the recent failed test. “We are in the process of obtaining further information about VADA’s finding and will have more to say soon on this developing situation. “In the meantime Jarrell continues to train for his June 1 fight against Anthony Joshua.” Miller, a former kickboxer, is unbeaten in professional boxing, having lost just once in 11 amateur bouts. He had reached the final of the famous Golden Gloves tournament in 2007, losing to Tor Hamer. But the American had to go pro in boxing, due to already being in the paid ranks for kickboxing.
