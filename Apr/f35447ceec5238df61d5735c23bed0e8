Lagos State government yesterday said that its Health Facility Monitoring and Accreditation Agency (HEFAMAA) had sealed 10 facilities for various offences.  The state Commissioner for Health, Dr. Jide Idris, who disclosed this, listed the offences as on unprofessionalism, lack of required and qualified manpower, unavailability of relevant equipment, poor environmental sanitation and other related infractions.  Idris counselled members of the public not to patronise any health facility not bearing the HEFAMAA logo. The commissioner also urged them to channel complaints and petitions in respect of unprofessional conducts by health care providers or health facilities to HEFAMAA office at Room 514, Ministry of Health, Alausa, Ikeja.  He said: “Please note that HEFAMAA is empowered to seal any unregistered health facility. To this end, members of the public, in their own interest, are hereby advised not to patronise any health facility that is not accredited by HEFAMAA.  Registered health facilities can be recognised by the HEFAMAA logo.” The commissioner also urged owners and operators of health facilities to ensure they complete their registration with HEFAMAA, collect the agency’s logo and display them at a visible position in their  facilities, where members of the public could see it. He added: “We’re working on a technological- based platform to ease registration of facilities and conduct other functions and responsibilities of HEFAMAA.  I have no doubt that the e-platform will make the operations of HEFAMAA less cumbersome while also availing facilities and members of the public the opportunity to interface with the agency seamlessly.”
