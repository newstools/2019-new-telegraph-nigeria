The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has accused the Attorney- General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), of involving in a plot to scuttle the collation of the results of Rivers State governorship election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). INEC had said that the collation of the results of the March 9 governorship election would begin tomorrow, April 2. But PDP in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, alleged that the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, had been boasting that the AGF would write to the Chairman of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, to stop the collation. “Our party urges the AGF to note that there is no provision of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) or any part of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended) that, in anyway, empowers the AGF to interfere or stop the process of election, until declaration of result is made,” the party said. The state also warned Malami to restrain himself from being used to commit unconstitutional acts, noting that Amaechi, in his desperation, would want to rope him in and use him to cause a constitutional crisis that had the capacity to derail the nation’s democracy. “The constitution and laws of our nation are clear on the powers and statutory functions of the Attorney- General, and that he has no powers to interfere in the conduct of elections or direct the stoppage of an electoral process. “The AGF should therefore distance himself from the ignoble scheme by Rotimi Amaechi to cause trouble in Rivers State by attempting to scuttle the collation of results in the Rivers governorship election,” PDP further warned. The party also called on INEC to save the nation a serious crisis by asserting its independence.
