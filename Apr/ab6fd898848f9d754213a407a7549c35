 As part of efforts to build future model citizens, I6 talented teenagers will be selected from different parts of the country to participate in a new TV reality show where they will undertake diverse tasks capable of leading to a successful life.
Star Scholar Naija (SSN), children’s reality TV show, is aimed at ensuring that the 16 talented teenagers are immersed in a learning experience as well as broaden their knowledge and experience of the world around them through creative, scientific exploration and problem solving strategies, thereby mastering coping skills for a successful life.
Speaking recently in Lagos, West African Regional Director for the Ford Foundation, Innocent Chukwuma, expressed confidence in the project and promised that they would be giving their support in order to contribute to the realisation of the objectives of the show.
He said that more than ever before, there is the need to create programmes with family appeal that will impart value while still meeting the entertainment cravings of a youthful audience.
Meanwhile, the teenagers, aged 13-16 years will be camped in a safe Nest, a hostel-like accommodation for 21 days, where under the guidance of a show host, facilitators and counsellors, are exposed to games, talent hunts, academic and critical reasoning exercises and sporting activities, while competing as individuals as well as in groups.
Director of Eagles’ Nest Educational Research Limited, an educational research organisation and the brain behind the initiative, Bimbo Fisayo, said it would be a truly engaging TV show that will serve a creative purpose, contain high entertainment value, and be family friendly.
Fisayo said that auditions for the show will begin in April 2019 while the show will be aired on DSTV and GOTV on the Africa Magic Family Channel in August 2019.
She said: “The show is designed to groom and nurture inherent talent, instil discipline and promote friendship, reward academic excellence, teach and encourage teamwork, build problem solving skills, encourage role modelling using mentors to inspire, teach and encourage global awareness and sustainability.”
She added that at the end of the day, the ultimate Star Scholar will emerge based on a points tally in a league format.
