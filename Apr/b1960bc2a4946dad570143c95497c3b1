Tanzanian’s music star, Diamond Platnumz, has accused his fellow artiste, Peter Okoye of P-Square, of sleeping with his former lover Zari Hassan while the two were still dating, which eventually led to the end of their union. According to the musician, his baby mama rolled in the sheets with the likes of P-Square and her personal gym trainer. During an interview with a radio station, the ‘Number One’ crooner claimed he was not the only one with skeletons in his closets and that Zari was also to blame for their failed relationship. He added that no woman dumps him, so his fans should not buy the narrative of him getting booted on Valentine’s Day 2018. “Zari is my fellow parent and I respect her, but I have been quiet for long. She used to cheat on me while we were together,” he said. In retaliation, Zari claimed the allegations were false and baseless as she had never stepped out while they were together. “If you are willing to believe a man who went on radio to deny his child then you must be very stupid,” she said. In a few Instagram videos that have since been deleted, the mother of five claimed Diamond is a liar who is just seeking publicity using her name. She added that she and her kids are doing okay without Diamond and that the musician has never made a point to see their children since October 2018. “You say I did not let you see the kids and I did not want to bring them to Tanzania. My lawyer told your lawyer to make a parental plan but you did not heed to that. I cannot just ship the kids to Tanzania,” Zari stated. She further stated that Diamond does not provide for their kids in any way and should leave them alone since she and her family are contented and done with all the drama.
