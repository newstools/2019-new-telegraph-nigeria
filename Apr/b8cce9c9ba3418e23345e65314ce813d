Tume held his breath as Nessa stared at him and looked away. Tami had been a great and dependable friend. Tami would do anything to make her happy. It was payback time. “So you noticed she’s been keeping to herself lately? It’s okay. She can come home with us. It’s even better. She needs proper care. I’ll ensure she’s well cared for,” she replied. Tume relaxed. He shouldn’t have worried. His wife loved Tami so much and would do anything for her. He felt sad suddenly. He loved her but had failed her. He would look for a way to make up for his unpardonable behaviour towards her. A provoked trousers snake has no conscience! That’s one tool that could destroy even the most powerful king. He pulled his wife into his arms, planted a kiss on her forehead and draped his hand around her shoulders as they walked back into the room where Tami was waiting. “Tami, you are going home with us. We can’t have you falling ill with no one to take care of you. Nessa and I want you to come home with us,” Tume told her while Nessa nodded with a big smile.
“Babe, I’ll nurse you until you are delivered of our baby,” Nessa said with a sincere smile. Tami was confused. How could she reject this offer? She was lonely, especially at nights and the Blood Pressure issue was a big problem. What if no one was around when it started? What would have happened to her? She shuddered at the thought and Nessa asked if she was cold.
“No babe, just thinking what could have happened if I was alone in the house when I had that splitting headache,” she said truthfully, adding, “Thanks for being there for me all the time.”

They had been so good to her. She had not gone on leave in three years. She had thrown herself into her job since she broke up with Dele. Now she had three years accumulated leave plus her three months maternity leave which her office had graciously approved. So she stayed at home while Tume and Nessa went to work. She had dissuaded Tume from sneaking back home after Nessa had left for the office. She’d been bad to her friend, but she wouldn’t defile her home. “Tami, I really can’t understand why you won’t talk about the father of your baby. I never, in my wildest dream, believe you could keep things from me. If you don’t tell me, who will you tell? You begged me to keep the news away from Daddy, which I did. How else do I prove my friendship and loyalty to you?” She sighed. Nessa’s words made her very weak. They were alone in the house. Tume had a business meeting with some clients somewhere in town. She sighed again and began, “My dear sister, keeping this secret from you has caused me sleepless nights. I never believed I could hide anything from you. Am very sorry. We make mistakes and at times, we find ourselves in situations that we cannot help. I found myself in such a situation about eight months ago.” Nessa moved closer and Tami continued, “If a seer had foreseen what happened more than eight months ago, I wouldn’t have believed it. But it happened. I shudder whenever I remember that incident. What is it with passion? Why do we human beings think with our groins when we should think with our heads? Nessa, I cry whenever I think of the betrayal. That a friend could…” Nessa’s phone rang and she answered it. “Sweetheart, really, I deserve 100 strokes of cane on my bare buttocks for my foolishness. Could you believe I left the file for this meeting on the dining table? Please you have to bring it for me. My clients will be here any moment from now. Please my love, I’m in Surulere. Will send the address via text message to you now. I love you.” Nessa smiled and told Tami, “It’s Tume. He forgot the file he would need for his meeting on the dining table. I have to take it to him immediately. Men! I wonder what they think about. Have to rush there dear.”
Tami nodded and muttered under her breath, “Unfortunately, I know what your husband thinks about.” Nessa changed into a pair of Jeans trousers and top, picked up the file from the dining table . “Babe, eat and rest o. Our baby needs all the food and rest you can give it. Will be back shortly,” she told Tami as she dashed out.
Alone in the house, Tami stretched out on the couch. She recalled the past few minutes and gasped. “What did I nearly do now? What was I about to say to Nessa? OMG! Was I about to tell her that I had not only been sleeping with her husband, but expecting his child? Tami, you are totally out of your mind. I’m sure this is how witches feel when they want to confess their evil deeds. Living under this roof with Nessa and Tume is not the best but what choice do I have? Can’t go back home now. My due date is nigh. Moreover, the doctor said it could be earlier,” she said aloud.
She remembered her mother’s favourite saying, “Worry is like a rocking chair, it keeps you busy.” Her spirit felt heavy. Thoughts of her late mother usually left her so.
“Oh mum. I’m sure this wouldn’t have happened if you were alive. I’m sorry I have disappointed you. You loved Nessa as your own child. I’m sorry mum. Please forgive me. How do I get out of this?”
The activities in her womb were increasing. She wasn’t feeling any pain but something strange was happening in there. She tried to sleep. The PHCN did not disappoint, it was holding on to power firmly, so she couldn’t switched on the television which would have kept her company. Turning on the generator was out of it because she didn’t have the strength to do that. She picked up her phone and noticed that the battery was almost drained. “This is one problem with this Android phone,” she said and tried to relax. About 50 minutes later, she woke up with a start. She felt like using the loo. On her way back from the loo, she felt a cramp in her left thigh and stopped immediately. It eased off after a few minutes and she walked back to the couch and tried to sleep again.
One good thing about sleep is that it is akin to death. The sleeper loses consciousness, albeit for a definite time unlike death. She felt uncomfortable thinking about death now. Then the pain returned. She picked her phone, the screen was blank. It was dead. She smiled as she recalled the story of how poverty visited a man in his home. Poverty knocked on a man’s door. “Who is that?” the man asked and got the reply, “It’s me Poverty.”
“Ah Mr. Poverty, I’m sorry I have neither bed nor chair for you to relax in please,” the man shouted from within. Poverty answered, “Don’t bother yourself my friend, I came with my own mat.” Each time she remembered that story, she shuddered. Today, Tami tried to locate herself in that story which she was sure she read in one of Chinua Achebe’s novels. She couldn’t remember which now because the pain was coming at intervals. She remembered all she had learnt at the ante-natal classes. Could this be labour pain? She shuddered as fear gripped her. …..
Meanwhile, Tume’s business meeting had ended. It was a success. Nessa got there at the right time. She was such a dutiful wife. When she walked in, he noticed that the men stared at her. He felt so proud. No doubt, his wife had regained her killer shape after the pregnancy. That shape attracted him to her the first day they met.
“Darling, let us hang out a bit. It’s been long we are out together like this,” Tume told her.
Nessa smiled. This was the man she fell in love with years ago. “Lemme call Tami and know how she’s doing my love,” she said, fiddling with her phone. “Hmmmmmm switched off. Am sure her phone battery is down,” she said.
Tume winced. “Sweetheart, I want to be with you, just you and I,” he whispered into her ears, blowing warm air on her neck. They were in an exclusive bar somewhere in Victoria Island. With light turned down, the ambience was perfect for lovers. The wine made her a bit woozy but she didn’t mind. She was with the man she loved so much. “Why did I get myself into the mess I’m in at home? A little restrain and I wouldn’t be in this mess. Pure irresponsibility on my part led to this. Tami developed cold feet immediately she found out I had no ‘protection’ that first day. Why did I make the move that day? I could have gone for a sheath as she suggested. Tami is almost a sister to me. How do I sort out this problem?” Tume argued within him. He pulled his wife very close to him and gave her a deep kiss. He resolved to do this more often. No one can come between him and his wife. Four and half hours later, they were home. After repeated banging of the door without response, Tume raced down to pick the spare door key he usually have in his car. They stopped dead on their track immediately they stepped into their living room. Tami was lying on the floor… ****
