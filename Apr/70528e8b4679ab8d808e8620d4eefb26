The Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, has charged the media on the need to focus on investigative news reporting, saying that the development will make government more accountable to the public.  Osinbajo, who spoke yesterday at the opening of a two-day conference on Legal and Ethical Issues in Investigative Reporting in Abuja, made a strong case for “self-regulation”, which he argued, remained the best tool of regulating the media.  The event was organised by the Daily Trust Foundation and the Centre for Media Law and Development, with support from McArthur Foundation in Abuja. Speaking through his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mr. Laolu Akande, Osinbajo said: “We are living in the interesting time. The free press has arrived at its best time. Everyone of us can have access to our own media. “This is the age of social and fake news can spread like wild fire.  The press can make government more accountable through investigative journalism. “We should be careful of over regulation of the media. Self-regulation is the best mode of regulating the media. If this is enough, we would have less or no government regulation.  “The media should set for itself an ethical benchmark, by appointing an ombudsman that would be paid by the media organisations and not by the government.  In another development, Osinbajo has advocated for an increase in the remuneration of medical workers, especially Doctors to improve the effectiveness of the health sector. The Vice President said an effective National Health Insurance scheme remained the best panacea for the development of the health sector and an efficient healthcare delivery in the country.
