Golden Eaglets head coach Manu Garba has cited the physical inferiority one of the reasons for his side’s defeat to Guinea in the semifinals of the U-17 AFCON which will end this weekend in Tanzania. The Nigerian lads put up a gallant fight against their fellow West Africans but were eliminated in a marathon penalty shootout which ended 10-9 in favour of the Guineans. And despite missing out of what would have been their third title at the biennial event, Garba, who guided Nigeria to a World Cup title in 2003 praised his players, stating that they played ‘gallantly’ in the face of ‘bigger’ Guinean U-17 boys. “I congratulate my colleague for the victory but I must say that even in defeat we lost gallantly, despite the fact that the Guineans were bigger in size than my boys,” Garba said after the match. “They used their physical presence to intimidate some of the players. “Of course they had the protection of the centre man some certain times. But I must say that we gave a good account of ourselves. “We created more chances than the Guineans. We were just unlucky not to [wrap up the game in regular time]. But the ultimate is to qualify for the World Cup and that’s what we have done. “So I say congratulations to the Guineans.” Garba’s claim about the ‘bigger’ Guinea U-17 side comes after Senegal voiced their displeasure over alleged age-cheating in Camara’s squad.
