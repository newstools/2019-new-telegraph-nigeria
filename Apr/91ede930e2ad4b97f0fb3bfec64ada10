The wife of the Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, Bisi has declared that hands must be on deck to curb the increasing menace of sexual abuse in the state. This, the governor’s wife added that the increasing incidences of sexual and domestic violence against women in the state was becoming worrisome. Mrs. Fayemi hinted that government was saddened that in spite of existing laws prohibiting gender-based violence Ekiti had continued to witness issues of rape, defilement and human trafficking. She disclosed that what accounted for the increase was the non-implementation of the gender-based violence prohibition law, child right law, equal opportunities law and other legislation by the immediate past government earlier put in place by Governor Fayemi. She spoke in Ado Ekiti yesterday during a stakeholders’ meeting held to combat violence against women in Ekiti. She said: “When Fayemi left, some of the laws put in place to safeguard the lives of women and girl child were not implemented,” saying this constituted a serious snag in the fight against the practice. “At a stakeholders’ meeting held recently, we agreed that part of the policy thrust should be that steps must be taken on how to take care of the emotional needs of victims before seeking or get justice through the court of law.”
