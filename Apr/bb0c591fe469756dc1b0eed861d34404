A candidate for the position of speaker in the House of Representatives, Hon. Mohammed Umaru Bago, has denied reports that he has withdrawn from the race to support Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila. Bago, who in a statement by his campaign spokesperson, Hon. Victor Adam Ogene, said “the pursuit of justice is a marathon and not a sprint dash,” insisted that is still in the contest to lead the 9th House of Representatives billed for inauguration in June.  The statement read: “We denounce the scaremongering tactics of some persons who gleefully dish out falsehood to the effect that Hon. Bago has stepped down from the race so as to distract our campaign.  “Such insidious disposition besides being malicious, untrue and unbecoming, has never really assisted anyone ascend an unmerited position. For the avoidance of any doubt, Hon. Bago is in the speakership race not merely driven by personal ambition, but instead propelled by the aspiration and quest of his people of the North Central zone for inclusiveness in governance.  “For us, therefore, the task ahead requires the tenacity of a marathon runner, and any thought of quitting only looms large in the infantile imagination of those who wish Hon. Bago were not in the field.  “Having being clearheaded about the injustice against the North Central, we reiterate that the only redress possible is a Bago victory – a feat which by the grace of God, and the increasing number of converts to our cause, we shall achieve.  “We are not unaware of the alleged endorsement of the party’s position by some lawmakers from Niger state. But, while we cannot deny them their democratic right, we insist that the ultimate decision rest with all 360 members on inauguration day.”
