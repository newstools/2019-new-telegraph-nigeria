A 50-year-old man from Niger Republic has been arrested by the Police in Niger State for allegedly stabbing his neighbour severally over a failed attempt to rape a 14-year-old girl in Minna, Niger state. The suspect, Sani Yusuf, a Security Guard was apprehended by the operatives attached to the Bosso Division in Bosso Local Government Area of the state. Yusuf was said to have stabbed one Asabe  Zagi, 60, of Tudun Fulani area of Minna in Bosso of the same address over an allegation of making advances towards her 14-year-old granddaughter. Findings have it that the suspect used a sharp knife to stab Zagi about ten times with sharp knife insisting that he never made advances towards her granddaughter or bought her sim card. Yusuf, the father of seven children, who narrated to our correspondent what led to the stabbing of his victim, said “Zagi, a staff of Bosso Council invited me to her house and accused me of buying a sim card for her daughter so as to lure her and have sex with her. “I told her I will be the last person to do that and at the heat of an argument, I stabbed her. “For some time now, she has been accusing me of having affairs with her grandchild and I told her I can’t do that because I have her mate at home but she refused to listen to me. The suspect, however, regretted his action but refused to accept what he did not do, adding that he stabbed her out of extreme provocation. Confirming the incident on Tuesday, the Command’s Police Public Relations Officer, Muhammad Abubakar, said the suspect had confessed to the crime and would be arraigned in court soon.
