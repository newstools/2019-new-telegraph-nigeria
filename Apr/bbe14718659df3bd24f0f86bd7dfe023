Thomas Dennerby is untroubled by Nigeria women’s setback following a 2-1 defeat to Canada in a friendly at Pinatar Arena. The 59-year-old insists that they are closer to their best with two months to the Women’s World Cup while appealing for patiencefromfanswithhisteam. “For every game we play, we’re getting closer and closer,” Dennerby told Goal. “We know that we have a couple of players that were not here in Spain but will definitely be fighting for a shirt in the starting eleven. We’ve had great camping so far but it’s still two months to the World Cup and when it’s June, we will have the best players on the field. “It doesn’t matter whether you’re 17 or 35 years old, where you’re from or where you play, it’s just those with the technical stuff that can give the best performance on the pitch that we care about. “There is an improvement but for those that understand the business, it’s a long time of hard work. It’s not about bringing in a new coach and expect they play better because it takes some time to find the right players that would suit the style you want to use. “Same time, you need to give a good chance to the ones that are there when to arrive to see if they are the best and at the same time also begin to search for new ones when you’re not 100 percent sure of some positions.”
