Wilfred Ndidi’s no-nonsense approach in dominating the midfield has been recognised after he was named the top tackler in Europe’s top five leagues by Whoscored.com. The Leicester City midfielder placed first ahead of Idrissa Gueye (Everton) and Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Crystal Palace). According to the stats, Ndidi has put in more tackles than any other player in the English Premier League, Bundesliga, Italian Serie A, French Ligue 1 and La Liga, with 123 tackles. He has dispossessed an opponent two times more than Gueye and eight more than Wan-Bissaka. In other defensive stats, the Nigeria international has made 68 interceptions, 71 clearances, 279 recoveries, won 124 aerial battles and has zero errors leading to a goal. The product of Nath Boys Academy has been yellow carded seven times this season without being suspended for accumulated bookings.
