Stakeholders in the tourism industry have made some moves towards setting an agenda for President Muhammadu Buhari in his second tenure. This was even as they demanded that Buhari should take some corrective steps and immediately separate culture and tourism from the present Ministry, where it is domiciled. President, Federation of Tourism Association of Nigerian (FTAN ), Mr. Rabo Saleh, said such action would contribute immensely to the development of full tourism potential, while making Nigeria a tourism destination of choice, not just in Africa but globally. He made this plea in Abuja during a ” Project Tourism ” launch, which they said was designed to, among other things, highlight the rich tourism assets of Nigeria and run profitable hospitality culture as well as unravel the country’s cultural endowments. Another stakeholder, Prince Ned Nwoko , who conceptualised ” Project Tourism ” and the promoter of a private sector tourism investment organisation, noted that if government should give tourism the required attention, the industry could contribute hugely to Nigeria’s economic development.  Nwoko said that his organisation is collaborating with Nigeria Tourism Development Corporation ( NTDC ) in promoting the project designed as a blueprint that will bring Nigeria’s tourism industry to global relevance. He added:”Project tourism is therefore geared towards encouraging tourists, exchange students and the likes, get firsthand experience of Nigeria’s tourism offering through taking rural residences, among Nigerian communities”. Also, the Director General of NTDC, Folorunsho Coker, said operators in tourism industry must ensure that training and retraining was given adequate attention, so as to be abreast with global best practices. The DG, who was represented by Ahmed Sule, the Head, Public Relations of National Institute for Hospitality and Tourism ( NIHOTOUR ) noted that training was key to effective management of the Tourism industry.
