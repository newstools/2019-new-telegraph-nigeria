The Anambra State Government yesterday said it had arraigned over 150 suspected fake revenue collectors in the state. The state’s Commissioner for Commerce, Trade and Wealth Creation, Dr. Christian Madubuko, who disclosed this to journalists in Awka, said the suspects were arrested in different locations in the state while selling and extorting money from the public despite the ban on collection of Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) in the state. Parading about 13 suspects arrested in Onitsha, at the Jerome Udoji Secretariat, Awka, the commissioner said the state’s Task Force on IGR had in the past two weeks arrested over 75 of them. He noted that this was in addition to those earlier arrested since the enforcement of the ban. He said: “These agents have milked Anambra State dry, adding that the state government is losing millions of naira to the activities of fake revenue collectors. “They parade unauthorised authority papers, claiming that the Anambra State Government gave them the authority to collect the revenue on her behalf. “Anambra State Government has not authorised anybody to collect any revenue on her behalf and the ban on the sale of emblem, or any kind of IGR and street trading is in full force. “These bad elements have also forged my signature, that of the Secretary to the State Government (SSG) and the Chief of Staff. I charge the general public and residents of the state to arrest anybody or group of persons found collecting any forms of revenue in any parts of the state.” He also directed the caretaker Chairman of the Onitsha Main Market, Chief Ikechukwu Ekwesgalu, who deployed same touts as decongestion task force to withdraw them immediately or face the wrath of the government.
