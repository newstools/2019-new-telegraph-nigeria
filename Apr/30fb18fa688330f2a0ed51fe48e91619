Ifu Ennada, Big Brother Naija star, says most men who flaunt pictures of their wives and kids on social media are usually the ones who cheats the most. The Nollywood actress made this claim on her Instastory. She insisted that based on her personal experiences, a man who cheats will most likely post his family pictures on social media. “Most men who always post pictures of their wives and kids are usually the one who cheat the most. The things my eyes have seen. God pls continue to guide me, keep temptation away from me. I only want what you want for me,” Ennada said. Ennada’s assertion on infidelity contradicts popular opinion which holds that most faithful married men show off their family pictures online to ward off unwanted attention from ladies.
