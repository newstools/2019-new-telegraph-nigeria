Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) yesterday expressed concern over the delay by President Muhammadu Buhari in signing the National Minimum Wage (Amendment) Bill into law. NLC General-Secretary, Dr. Peter Ozo-Eson, expressed the feeling in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja. Ozo-Eson said the delay in signing the bill into law by Mr. President had become very worrisome to the labour movement. He said the organised labour was concerned that it had taken long since the transmission of the bill from the National Assembly to the Presidency. HE said: “We had thought that given all processes before arriving at that point, the long delay in setting up a tripartite committee, the long period before the tripartite committee to now finalise the process and all the debates that had gone on, the president would have signed the bill into law. “We thought that this was something Mr. President would assent to very quickly, because as we had earlier indicated, we would want this implementation to be before May. “Our position is to call on Mr. President to, without further delay, assent to the New National Minimum Wage Bill, so that workers can start to enjoy the new minimum wage implementation before May Day.’’
