Herdsmen suspected to be of Fulani extraction have killed five farmers at Mondo village, Ukemberagya Gaambetiev Ward, Logo Local Government Area of Benue State. The gunmen invaded the village about 11p.m. on Tuesday when most people were asleep and killed five people.  A community leader in the local government, Chief Joseph Anawah, gave the names of those killed as Torkaa Gbim, Celina Tavershima, Ayilaga Tavershima, Sonter Tavershima and Terkaa Tavershima. He added that scores of others were still missing. Thousands of inhabitants, including women and children, were also rendered homeless as a result of the attack while many others were taking refuge in Anyiin, the traditional headquarters of Logo Local Government.  A resident of Mondo village, Mbaapasega Mondo, told journalists that one of his brothers, Aondover Iorver, who was also attacked with a machete by the invaders, managed to escape death. He disclosed that another woman, who was shot in the leg, was receiving treatment at the NKST Hospital, Anyiin.  Mondo said the attackers were communicating in both Fulani and Jukun languages as they continued to launch attack on the villages. The Chairman of Logo Local Government Area, Mr. Richard Nyajo, confirmed the killing of five people. Nyajo said he had already reported the matter to the Commander of Operation Whirl Stroke (OPWS), Major General Adeyemi Yekini. Yekini also confirmed the attack but said it was a spill over of the Jukun/Tiv crisis in Kente, Taraba State on Tuesday. Yekini said his troops had already visited the scene of the attack.
