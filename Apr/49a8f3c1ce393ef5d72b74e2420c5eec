The management of Lagos State University yesterday described allegation against Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of Council, Prof. Adebayo Ninalowo and Vice- Chancellor, Prof. Lanre Fagbohun of diverting N198 million staff pension to acquire some luxury cars, as a subterfuge, baseless and unfounded. The university in a statement by the Coordinator, Centre for Information, Press and Public Relations, Mr. Ademola Adekoya and made available to New Telegraph yesterday noted that “the management of Lagos State University wishes to inform the general public that these allegations are false and baseless and hereby set the record straight.” According to the institution, the National Universities Commission (NUC) had recently in its statutory responsibilities informed Nigerian universities that accreditation exercise of programmes would be conducted once in a year between October and November, and any university which failed to participate in the accreditation exercise would not be able to admit students into programmes due for accreditation, but are yet to be accredited by the Commission.
