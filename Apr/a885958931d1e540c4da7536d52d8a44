Former Golden Eaglets coach and Manager of the Tanzania national football team Emmanuel Amuneke has hailed teenage star, Samuel Chukwueze, comparing the Villarreal forward with himself.
The former African Player of the Year said the ex- Golden Eaglets player could become a better player that he was during his active days if he continues his rise.
Amuneke was impressed with Chukwueze fast rise in LaLiga, leading to his inclusion in the Super Eagles, Dream Team VII, and most recently, the Flying Eagles.
Chukwueze came into limelight with his exploit in the World Cup-winning national U-17 side which was handled by Amunike.
The coach added: “I am happy for his progress, I am also happy for his growing achievements in Europe; I I am aware of his potentials, he’s good player, that was why I decided to keep him in camp when he was faced with an injury challenge during the U-17 days. Amunike said.
“I knew he would go places, he is a player who plays exactly like myself.
“I am not surprised about his present status as a player, I am not surprised about his form, I saw that in him when he was even much younger.
