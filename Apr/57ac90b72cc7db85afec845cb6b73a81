A member of House of Representatives, Tony Nwoye (APCAnambra) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to appoint Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) from the South-East. Nwoye, who represents Anambra East and West Federal Constituency, stated this at an empowerment programme in Nsugbe near Onitsha yesterday.  The lawmaker, also a former governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, said the gesture would help market the party in the region. “Our people are feeling that they are being marginalised. “The Igbo people are critical to the Nigerian project, we cannot be marginalised perpetually because we did not vote for Buhari out of sheer sentiment.  “The South-East deserves the SGF or Deputy Senate President. “Mr. President, being a man with a large heart should give the Igbo people a sense of belonging and make them feel that they are part and parcel of the Nigerian project,” he said.  He added that such appointment would help rebrand the APC so it can win future elections in the region. He commended the Federal Government for constructing four roads in his constituency as well as awarding contract for construction of another road valued at N320 million.
