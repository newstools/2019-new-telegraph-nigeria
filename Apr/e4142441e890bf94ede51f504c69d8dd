Armed men believed to be herdsmen have killed at least 310 and injured 13 others in 39 different attacks in Gwer West Local Government Are of Benue State. A paramount ruler in the local government who is the Ter Tyoshin II, His Royal Highness, Chief Daniel Ayua Abomtse, disclosed yesterday.
The killings, according to the monarch, occurred within the period of nine years from February 8, 2011 to April 2, 2019. Abomtse spoke while interacting with the State Working Committee (SWC) of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Benue State Council, at Naka, headquarters of the local government.
The monarch said his subjects were still in pains. He wondered why herdsmen would invade his domain in the name of grazing only to kill, maim and occupy the people’s land.
The paramount ruler noted that the continual attacks and destruction of rural communities of the state by the herders called for concerted efforts by all to address the issue. Abomtse, who challenged the new executives of the union to leave legacies behind for others to emulate, noted that the union needed a conducive environment to operate. He said that if journalists failed in their duty, the whole world would collapse.
The state NUJ Chairman, Comrade Victoria Asher, said they were in his palace to condole with the Ter Tyoshin over the frequent attacks on his people by suspected herdsmen. Asher, who prayed God to give the traditional ruler the wisdom of King Solomon to rule over his people, encouraged him not to relent in his efforts at resisting the invasion and takeover of the people’s ancestral land.
The NUJ chairman assured him that the union would continue to partner with his palace in the area of publicity to attract attention to the plight of his people.
