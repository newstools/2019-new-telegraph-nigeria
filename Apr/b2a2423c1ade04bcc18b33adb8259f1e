All those were in the past. Presently, things were getting too tricky for Tume. Tami’s pregnancy was blossoming, Nessa was getting very heavy. He felt like an expectant father of twins. But the twins would come months apart and from two different women, two friends – his wife and her best friend. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He continued to play a good husband to his wife and a good lover to Tami.  Things had worked out perfectly well until the worst happened, when at almost eight months, Nessa lost her pregnancy again – the fifth miscarriage in nine years. She became broken and was almost at the verge of committing suicide.  Somehow, with the support of her hubby, in-laws and Tami, she pulled through. In truth, Tume was devastated but he had to pull himself together. After some weeks, life returned to near-normal at home, although, he had to be by his wife’s side always. After the trauma she went through, Nessa wasn’t too keen on trying for pregnancy again. She started considering another option -adoption. She broached the idea with her bestie, Tami.  They discussed it extensively and Tami was in support of the idea. One day, when Tami visited Nessa’s house, she saw Tume sleeping on the couch. Nessa told her he came home tired. They moved to the kitchen where she was preparing dinner.  They talked in hushed tones as they moved around the kitchen and laughed at their jokes. Suddenly, Nessa noticed that Tami had added weight. Her waist was thicker than it used to be. “Sister, you have to watch it. You’re getting too fat. Your waistline is <img class="size-medium wp-image-203379 alignleft" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sweet-smelling-evil-7.png?resize=300%2C159&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="159" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sweet-smelling-evil-7.png?resize=300%2C159&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sweet-smelling-evil-7.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1">looking like a pregnant goat’s,” she joked. A shocked Tami turned to her and responded, “How could you liken me to a pregnant goat? I’m not Virgin Mary who became pregnant without knowing a man.  Apart from one unfortunate incident about four months ago, I am almost a virgin again.” Nessa, who was cleaning the kitchen sink, stiffened. “Unfortunate incident? What happened?” she asked, but Tami burst into laughter and she joined. Tami noticed a slight movement. She was right. Tume was awake. He had been awake for sometime but didn’t want the women to know. It was fun eavesdropping on their conversation. He had stiffened when Nessa likened Tami’s waist to a pregnant goat’s.  “Damn it. Tami is very smart,” he mused. He knew that her last statement was for his benefit. He relaxed. They were setting the table for dinner. “So Tami’s pregnancy is now noticeable? In that case, she…no, we cannot hide it for long.  What will be her story? Who will she present as the father of her unborn baby? This is a lie we have to come up with fast. Yes, I have an idea. I just have to develop it. But wait, what if she sells the dummy that she was raped? Aha! I think we can explore that option; after all, she just spoke about an unfortunate incident.  That unfortunate incident could only be the first time we met as man and woman. So if Nessa buys that dummy, what else? How will I now claim that pregnancy? I must claim it o! Too bad Nessa is not able to give me a baby, but as the only son of my parents, I need to have children. How will it be said that I, Tume, doesn’t have a child? No way.” He shook his head and Nessa, who was moving into the sitting room noticed. “Baby you’re awake. You woke up at the right time.   Food is ready. Tami is around,” she told him. Tami appeared at the kitchen door and they exchanged greetings. “Gosh! Did I sleep off? He asked no one in particular. The two women looked at each other and laughed. “I’m famished. Is the table set?” He asked and they nodded. They moved to the dinette. Though the white rice served with vegetable stew tasted great, Tume’s taste bud took no notice. He was deep in thought. He needed Tami’s baby. The problem was how he would lay claim to the baby without hurting his wife.  The rape idea dropped in his mind; this was the second time it would occur to him. He smiled as the plan developed and he attacked his food with gusto. *** Tami was distraught. The pregnancy was flourishing. It was no longer news. The blind could see it.  Nessa was dying to know the man that did the wonder and that was Tami’s greatest worry. Of course, Tume was in a worse state. Nessa was becoming a more frequent visitor to Tami’s crib and that was making it difficult for the secret lovers to meet as often as they wanted. Once Nessa met Tume in Tami’s place but it wasn’t a big deal because they handled the situation smartly.  The story had been that Tume was in the neighbourhood and ran into Tami lugging a bag home. So he gave her a ride and helped carry the bag into her flat. They learnt a lesson from that incident. Now, the lovers used their mobile phones to update each other on Nessa’s movement. Their major challenge was getting the right answer to Nessa’s inquisitiveness. Simply put, Nessa was dying to know the father of Tami’s unborn child.   “Babe, I must let you know that I’m not happy with you. How can I not know who is responsible for my friend and sister’s pregnancy? Even if you don’t want to let my husband into the secret, don’t you think I should know?” Nessa asked her one day. Tami sighed. She expected the question. Lately, it had become a recurring decimal in their discussions.  Her refusal to give her friend a satisfying answer was already causing a strain in their relationship. It was also causing her serious emotional problem. The doctor had warned her to take things easy as her blood pressure was leaving the comfort zone. She was more than seven months gone and usually got tired easily. Nessa had always been there to help.  She had visited again today, after work. What would she have done without her? They cooked, ate and bantered. All of a sudden, they seemed to have nothing to say to each other and she became apprehensive. She was dead sure Nessa would ask that burning question again. The life inside her kicked sharply and she adjusted her sitting position. Nessa watched her friend and wondered why her friend was keeping this secret away from her.   “Is she ashamed of the man? Why would she be ashamed of a man that she allowed between her legs? Obviously, the pregnancy is a mistake. But then, Tami is no kid. Could it be that the man rejected the pregnancy? It could be because she’d been visiting Tami frequently, most times unannounced and she never met a man in her flat.  No sign that a man visits her, except Tume. Thank God Tume is sufficiently concerned about Tami’s wellbeing. He’s been so nice to her.  However, he’s not bothered about the identity of the man behind the pregnancy. Men! Things like that don’t bother them,” Nessa mused and her lips curled in a smile. Tami’s heart skipped a beat: “What does Nessa find amusing? What is going through her mind? Does she suspect Tume?  Oh my God! There’s something about that smile that is unsettling. What does Nessa know? Have we given ourselves away in anyway? Has Tume said or done something suspicious? I need to talk to him!”  Her mind was in turmoil. The fact that Nessa’s gaze was unwavering made her to panic.  There was this urgent urge to talk to Tume. She picked her phone to call and realised that it would be her greatest blunder. She dropped the phone suddenly, as if it had become a hot lead. Her head banged and she clutched it with her two hands. Nessa rushed to her side, worry written all over her face. “Babe, what’s the problem?”  Tami held on to her head, she could barely talk. “You need to see a doctor. Lemme get a cab, I didn’t come with a car,” she walked quickly towards the door and retraced her footsteps immediately.   “Lemme find out where Tume is,” she said, picking her phone from the side stool. “Sweetheart, where are you? Ok, please come over to Tami’s ASAP. She needs medical attention,” she said and dropped the handset.  “What! Tami needs medical attention? Is she in labour?” Tume spoke into a dead phone. “Oh no. Nothing must happen to her and my child,” he muttered. Luckily, he wasn’t too far from Tami’s house.  He had been nursing a bottle of beer in a nearby bar, waiting for Nessa to leave. He signalled the bartender, dropped one thousand naira note on the table and rushed off. In less than 10 minutes, he was racing up the stairs to Tami’s flat.  Nessa opened the door immediately his finger touched the doorbell. “What happened to her?” he asked. Tami was holding her head. “This is not the time to ask questions; let’s take her to the hospital immediately,” Nessa replied.  After stabilising her at the hospital, the doctor informed Tume that they would keep Tami in the hospital for observation. Her blood pressure was bad. After four nights in the hospital, the doctor certified her fit to go home. Tume and Nessa were in the hospital to take her home. Tume was worried. He needed to be around her more often.  He took his wife to a secluded place and told her, “Dear, I’m thinking we should take Tami to our home. She needs us around her now. We can’t leave her to sleep alone at nights, not after this BP scare. You know people seldom visit her. It’s just a suggestion though.” Nessa stared at her hubby….  “***  Will the bubble burst?
