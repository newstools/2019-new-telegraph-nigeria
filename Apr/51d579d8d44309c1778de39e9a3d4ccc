The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has challenged President Muhammadu Buhari to tender his West African Examination Certificate, to the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal, and stop his diversionary tactics. The party in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said it was inexcusable for President Buhari to swear to an affidavit to claim an educational qualification he does not possess. PDP noted that the claim by Buhari’s campaign spokesperson, Festus Keyamo, that an aspirant does not need WAEC certificate, but the ability to speak English, to contest for the office of the president, was admittance that the president does not have a WAEC certificate as he claimed in his INEC form. “An attempt to deceive the public using a defective reading and skewed interpretation of a section of the constitution cannot exonerate President Buhari. “Moreover, section 295 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) is very clear on issues of interpretations and reference to questions of law,” the party said. It maintained that the onus is on President Buhari, as ‘Mr. Integrity,’ to tender the certificate he claims to possess before the tribunal instead of lame diversion from his aides.
