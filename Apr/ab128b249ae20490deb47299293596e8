Two more persons have been killed as cults members struck at Imalete Alafia and Igbojiya communities in Ibeju-Lekki Local Government Area of Lagos State.  A resident of Igbojiya, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a man named Focus, was killed and mutilated by the group about 10a.m. yesterday at Igbojiya community. It was learnt that Focus, said to be a member of Eye confraternity, sat at a joint where a security man guiding one of the houses sells cooked noodles, bread and egg.  “Focus apparently wanted to have his breakfast, when the cult members circled him and shot him. “But the gunshots had no effect on him, so the cult boys attacked Focus with machetes and axes as he tried to escape.  “He became weak, having received severe cuts on his skull, neck and several parts of the body. He died near a popular spot in the community,” the source narrated.  It was also learnt that the group had a few minutes earlier killed another person in the neighbouring Imalete Alafia town. Prior to the latest cult killings, one person was butchered in like manner on Saturday at Imalete Alafia.  Meanwhile, the remains of Focus had already been removed by a team of policemen who arrive on invitation by some members of Igbojiya town.
