A commercial motorcyclist otherwise called ‘Okada man’ was electrocuted yesterday near the Civil Service Commission area of Makurdi, Benue State. The motorcyclist was killed by a hightension wire which cut during the rain that lasted throughout the night and was dangling from the pole. It was learnt that the motorcyclist, who was oblivious of the danger, was electrocuted when his motorcycle touched the naked wire. A member of the community said the people tried to stop the cyclist but he did not hear them as they were shouting to draw his attention. “We tried stopping him but he didn’t hear us. Apparently, he didn’t know why we were asking him not to pass the area and he didn’t see the naked wire,” the man, who craved anonymity, said. At the time of filing this report, the remains of the rider had been evacuated to the morgue while officials of the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and the police were at the scene to control traffic and ensure that nobody else falls victim. The state Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the NSCDC, Adakola Peter, confirmed the incident. He said: “As soon as the deceased touched the naked wire, he got completed roasted and died instantly.” Adakole said the incident occurred about 7a.m., adding that the cyclist was carrying a passenger who, however, escaped narrowly as he jumped down from the motorcycle to save his life. The PRO said that officials of the Jos Electricity Distribution Company (JED) were already on ground to repair the damaged pole and high-tension wire while NSCDC officials were also still on ground to control traffic in the area.
