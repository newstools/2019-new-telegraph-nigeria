Implementation of the standards will strengthen banks’ balance sheet  There are indications that the general downward trend in credit impairment charges noticeable in the full year 2018 results so far released by deposit money banks (DMBs) in the country may have been largely due to the implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9 by the lenders last year. Issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), IFRS-9 were adopted by the Nigerian banking industry on January 1, 2012 as part of measures to improve reporting practices, transparency and disclosure among lenders.  Consequently, the country was expected to comply, when the IASB, in July 2014, issued the final version of IFRS 9 to replace IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement) and required all reporting entities that had adopted IFRS to implement the new accounting standard by January 1, 2018. Prior to that date, especially between 2016 and 2017, the slump in oil prices had resulted in a significant rise in Nigerian banks’ Non-Performing Loans (NPLs). For instance, in its annual report and statement of accounts for 2017, the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) revealed that DMBs’ NPLs for 2017 was N2.36 trillion. This, however, represented a 13.46 per cent decrease in the NPLs compared to N2.08 trillion in 2016. In fact, the NPLs have been steadily declining as New Telegraph’s analysis of the Full Year 2018 results of six major lenders shows that they reported reduced credit losses for 2018. Specifically, Zenith Bank’s 2018 full year results shows that the Tier 1 lender’s impairment charges eased to N18.372billio in 2018 from N98.227billion in the previous year. Similarly, Guaranty Trust Bank’s results indicate a 59.68 per cent in its impairment charges for last year, that is, from N12.169 billion recorded in 2017 to N4.906 billion reported for last year. Also, UBA’s results show that its impairment charges went down to N4.529 billion in 2018 from N32.895 billion in the previous year. Access Bank also reported a drop in its impairment charges for last year to N14.657 billion from N34.467 billion in 2017.  Equally, Tier 2 lender, Stanbic IBTC, reported that its impairment charges went down to N2.940 billion in 2018 from N25.577 billion recorded for the previous year.  Another leading Tier 2 lender, Fidelity Bank, reported that its impairment loss on financial assets reduced by 62.75 per cent to N4 billion last year from N11 billion in the previous year. Commenting on the results, analysts at Financial Derivatives Company (FDC) Limited noted that the financial statements indicate: “Profitability driven by non-interest income and lower impairment; IFRS 9 helped drive down impairment across board; declining loan books due to relatively low demand for credit and reduced capacity of banks to lend.”  Also, in a report released last week, one of the global credit rating agencies, Standard and Poor’s (S&P) said it expects credit losses in the Nigerian banking sector to reduce to 2.75 per cent and 2.5 per cent in 2019 and 2020 respectively.  The agency, which stated this while commenting on the completion of the Merger and Acquisition (M&A) deal between Access and Diamond banks in a report obtained by this newspaper at the weekend, noted that the combination of the two lenders will lead to all NPLs being transferred to Access Bank, even as the Tier 1 lender’s cost of risk will also rise. But despite the expected increase in the level of Access Bank’s NPLs, S&P said this will not negatively impact the lender’s asset quality metrics. The agency noted: “All non-performing loans (NPLs) are to be transferred to Access Bank as a result of the deal. Similarly, cost of risk will increase from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent in 2019 as Access Bank will have to make additional Stage 2 and 3 loan impairments. We forecast that Access Bank will write off about N120 billion in 2019 and net charge-offs will average 0.5 per cent to 1.0 per cent of average customer loans between 2020 and 2021.  “We expect credit losses to normalize thereafter at around 1.0 per cent to 1.2 per cent, reflecting the good credit quality of Access Bank’s loan portfolio, which comprises about 50 per cent investment-grade corporate clients. To put this in context, we expect credit losses in the sector to reduce to 2.75 per cent in 2019 and 2.5 per cent in 2020. Access Bank’s asset quality metrics will compare adequately to top peers in Nigeria and regional peers,” S&P said. According to latest data released by CBN, the level of banking sector’s NPLs declined from as high as 16.21 per cent it was in February 2018, to 14.15 per cent as of April 2018. It would be recalled that Bloomberg reported in February this year that CBN had relaxed the time limit for commercial banks to absorb impairments from implementation of IFRS 9 rules on bad loans. According to the news agency, the apex bank said banks now have four years to absorb impairments arising from the implementation of IFRS 9 accounting standards last year, thereby easing fears that an immediate transition would have severe repercussions for banks’ capital adequacy ratios. It quoted CBN as saying that: “The total provision amount is to be absorbed over the next four years in four equal parts to cushion the effect.” Analysts believe that the IFRS 9 will make banks’ balance sheet more resilient, thus making the lenders more attractive to foreign investors.   Concerns are growing in industry circles over the impact that the implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9 this year could have on banks’ profitability.
