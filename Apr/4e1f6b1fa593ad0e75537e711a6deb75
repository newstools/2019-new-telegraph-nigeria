The member representing Ezza North/Ishielu Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Hon. Anayo Edwin Nwonu, yesterday told the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, that only the lawmakers will determine the leadership of the National Assembly not Oshiomhole and the APC.  He said Oshiomhole’s insistence that APC must determine the leadership of the 9th National Assembly, billed for inauguration June 11 and the party’s endorsement of some newly elected lawmakers, NASS leadership position for would not work.  He noted that only the lawmakers have the say on who leads them and that it is them that will choose their leaders on the day of their inauguration. Nwonu, who was elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), spoke to reporters in Abakaliki, Ebonyi the state capital; and vowed that the lawmakers will show Oshiomhole and his APC how to play politics on June 11.  Nwonu described the APC National Chairman a barking dog who cannot near the National Assembly to make any input during election of the new leadership. He words: “Right now, you cannot conclude what will happen in the National Assembly until the day of inauguration.  I want you to forget about party issues and propaganda by the All Progressives Congress (APC), and what the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is saying.  “Lawmakers politics is quite different from what you are seeing. On 11th June, by the special grace of God when we will be inaugurated, you will see a different scenario playing out, you will see a different thing altogether playing.” “By then, the APC chairman will not be in that chamber, Mr. President will not be in that chamber. So, it is the lawmakers that will decide who they give their leadership. So for now, I will not let out the cat out of the bag on the game we are playing.
