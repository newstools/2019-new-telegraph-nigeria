Prestige Assurance Plc’ s net profit for the 2018 financial year dropped by 20.3 per cent to N423.795 million from N531.841 million posted in 2017. The audited financial reports obtained from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) showed that the insurance firm recorded a profit before tax of N645.430 million during the period under review, from N697.989 million recorded a year earlier. However, gross premium written grew by 25.84 per cent from N3.808 billion in 2017 to N4.792 billion in 2018 financial year. Prestige Assurance Plc had also declared a final dividend of 3 kobo per 50 kobo share for its 2018 financial period. This is however, subject to shareholders’ approval and appropriate withholding tax. The dividends according to the insurance firm, will be paid electronically to shareholders whose names appear on the Register of Members as at Friday, May 3, 2019. Also, only those who have completed the e-dividend registration and mandated the Registrar to pay their dividends directly into their bank accounts will receive payment. Shareholders of Prestige Assurance were last year assured of payment of dividend for the 2018 financial year. This assurance was given by Managing Director of the insurer, Mr Balla Swammy, at the company’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) held in Lagos. Swammy explained that the dividend should be paid to shareholders for the 2018 business year because the firm, in 2017, cleared the accumulated loss for year 2015 and 2016. He said last year, Prestige Assurance raised its earnings per share to N9.90kobo from N4.13kobo, while the profit after tax increased to N532 million from N222 million in 2016, representing 140 percent growth. Besides, he said last year, the insurance firm posted a Gross Written Premium of N3.809 million compared with N2.614 million recorded in 2016. Swammy attributed this growth of the premium to the relocation of the Abuja, Ikeja (Lagos) and Kano branches to profitable centres.
