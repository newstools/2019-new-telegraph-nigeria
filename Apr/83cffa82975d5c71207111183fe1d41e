One of the attributes of political gatherings is extortion of politicians by street urchins and in some instances, party members. Any gathering devoid of these characters cant be counted as political, these elements make politics related events tick. The urchins, usually have different strategies of obtaining money from their prey. In one instance, they praise them, at another, they heap abuses on them especially when their financial interests were not well attended to. Few weeks ago, a political gathering at the secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State brought out abusive side of the street urchins who waited patiently for a former Deputy Governor in the state to drop something big for them. But not ready to join the bandwagon of his fellow politicians who splashed crispy Naira notes to the ravaging guys, the ex-DG simply ignored them and did as though they were not communicating. In a show fury, the angered youngmen, who are handful in number, started pelting the politician with abusive words in local language.
