 Seplat Petroleum Development Company has begun search for the $700 million investment for a joint gas project with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). The project, according to a statement, is scheduled to start production next year, as government steps up plans to reduce the country’s reliance on oil. The scheme, known as Assa North-Ohaji South, is one of the seven aimed boosting gas production and infrastructure development in the continent’s biggest producer of crude. “ANOH Gas Processing Co., which is owned by Seplat and Nigerian Gas Co., a unit of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, will develop, build and operate the plant in southeastern Imo State,” a report by Bloomberg detailing the transaction read. Seplat and Nigerian Gas will provide 60 per cent of the funds as equity, while ANOH will source the balance as debt, Seplat Chief Executive Officer Austin Avuru said in an interview with the news agency in Lagos. “Both parties already have each contributed $100 million in equity,” Avuru said. “There will be another equity injection and at the back end of it will be debt,” he added. The plant, which will process wet gas from the unitized upstream fields at OML 53 and OML 21, has an initial capacity of 300 million standard cubic feet per day. It’s scheduled to begin production by the last quarter of 2020 and the first supply is targeted in 2021, Avuru said. Nigeria’s government is encouraging investments in gas infrastructure to improve supplies to power companies and diversify the economy away from oil, which currently accounts for the bulk of revenue,” he said. “ANOH will target local customers and has the capacity to double production “depending on domestic demand and the availability of feeds including third-party gas.”
