Police have arrested some people for allegedly beheading a herdsman at Onunwakpu in Izzi Local Government Area of Ebonyi State.
The Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG), Musa Kimo, who disclosed this yesterday, said the police also arrested five war mercenaries in connection with the Enyibichiri/Enyigba crisis in Ikwo and Abakaliki local government areas of the state in which a family of six, among them an infant, were roasted. The warlords also shot dead three others. Last year, four residents of Onunwakpu were killed by herdsmen who attacked the community and destroyed houses, economic trees and other valuable properties.
At the weekend, a herdsman was allegedly beheaded in the community. Kimo spoke when he paid a courtesy call on Governor Dave Umahi to inform him of the launch of “operation poor fathe” in the state as directed by the Acting Inspector-General of Police (IG), Adamu Mohammed.
He said: “Some people have been arrested especially in respect of the gruesome murder of the Fulani in Izzi. Equally, some people were arrested; four or five who are mercenaries. They are with us, they are at the State Criminal Investigations and Intelligence Department (SCIID) and they are connected with the general crime that has to do with conflict. “I want to believe that investigation is pointing that they are directly or indirectly affected with those killings.
“We will continue to do our best in our professional manner. Our intension is to try as much possible to declare criminals persona non-grata.”
