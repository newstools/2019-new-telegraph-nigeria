The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Ebonyi State Command, yesterday said it has arrested 68 persons for drugs related offences. The command said the suspects were arrested for involvement in drug peddling and racketeering between January and April this year. The state’s Deputy Commander in-Charge of Intelligence and Operations of the agency, Mr. Ibrahim Bashir, said this in Abakaliki when officials of the agency sealed off a community town hall that served as warehouse for cannabis and other related drugs. He said that 15 of the suspects were prosecuted within the last three months. He said officials of the agency raided the community hall in Amaike Ezzangbo and recovered three bags of cannabis and other exhibits while five suspects were arrested and interrogated. Bashir said a key suspect, Mr. Amadi Chukwuma, 35, was held in the custody of the agency in addition to the exhibits. “The town hall we raided is a community hall named “Amadi Palace- Amaike Ezzangbo”, the community allowed the hall to be used for drug activities. “Two days ago, we raided the place, and in the process 3.8 kg of cannabis was recovered from one of the rooms inside the hall. “Those that have no question to answer after interrogation were released but the main suspect is here with us.” He disclosed that the suspects would soon be charged to court for prosecution. In an interview, one of the suspects named Mr. Amadi Chukwuma (35 years), who hails from Amaeke Ezamgbo Ohaukwu Local Government Area of the state pleaded guilty to the charge. The suspect said he was arrested in his residence by officials of the agency, maintaining that he embarked on the business in July 2018. “I was arrested in my house selling hard drugs, it is one of the drivers that brought the cannabis for me from Afikpo, I am not a troublesome person. “We were four doing the business, we don’t have sponsors, people we buy drugs send it to us for sale in large numbers,” he said.
