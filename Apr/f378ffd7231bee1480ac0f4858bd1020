The management of the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) has restated the commitment of the examination body to the educational development of schools and communities across the country, under its Corporate Social Responsibility (CRS) initiative. The Head of the Nigeria National Office (HNO) of WAEC, Mr. Olu Adenipekun, disclosed this during the launch of the WAEC’s Corporate Social Responsibility Project to some selected schools in the country. Under the first phase of the initiative, the Council purchased and distributed 1,050 branded student chairs and tables to no fewer than 21 schools, out of the 84 schools that will benefit from the project. While launching the project, Adenipekun said: “To this end, the Council in Nigeria has purchased 1,050 pieces of branded student chairs and tables for distribution to some selected schools which serve as venues for the Coordination of Examiners and Marking of Candidates’ Scripts for the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) for school and private candidates in the country.” According to him, the vision of the Council is to be a world-class examining body adding value to the education goals of its stakeholders. “In line with this vision, the Council in Nigeria has placed a high premium on the Nigerian child. Over the years, the Council has lived up to this mandate and has provided qualitative and reliable educational assessment, encouraged academic and moral excellence, promoted sustainable human resource development and international cooperation,” he added.
