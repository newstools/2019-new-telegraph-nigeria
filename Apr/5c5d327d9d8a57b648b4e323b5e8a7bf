The crisis rocking the Importers Association of Nigeria (IMAN), has worsened, as the Chairman of its Board of Trustees (BOT), Mr. Gilbert Obi, yesterday, asserted that Ambassador Chijioke Okoro was the Acting Director-General (Special Taskforce) of the association while Dr. Osita Okereke claims to be its substantive DG.  The BOT Chairman made the assertion in a press briefing in Abuja, when he told journalists that Okereke, who was former DG of IMAN, Special Taskforce formally ceased to function in that capacity in 2015.  According to him, the sack of Okereke followed his alleged declaration of false affidavit in court wherein he claimed that the IMAN certificate of incorporation was lost to armed robbers and subsequently deceived the Corporate Affairs Commission, CAC, into issuing him another.  He said: “Okereke, who is presently under police investigation over alleged impersonation and forgery besides other criminal offences is not the DG IMAN, Special Taskforce.  “He was suspended and sacked in 2015 by the IMAN, Board of Trustees, BOT. He fraudulently declared our certificate of incorporation lost and deceived the Corporate Affairs Commission, CAC, with a court affidavit that deceived them into believing him and, in effect, issued him with another certificate of incorporation.
