Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, has warned that Nigeria cannot afford to underrate Madagascar and Burundi, pointing out that the underdogs could be spoilers. The Eagles triumphed at their last outing at the tournament in 2013 but after back-to-back absence, the three-time winners are the favourites to top Group B which also has Guinea but the German manager said it would be foolhardy to overlook the two debutants at the 24-nations championships taking place between June 21 and July 19 in Egypt. The 65-year-old coach rather than underrate the duo, promised to take them seriously and reel out the best squad for Nigeria in what will be their opening and closing matches at Egypt 2019. While also disclosing that his side will land in Ismailia, Egypt for the last phase of their preparations for AFCON 2019, Rohr stressed that any team that qualified for the showpiece deserved respect from all other coaches. Rohr stated: “The group has two debutantes in Burundi and Madagascar, but one cannot write them off completely because they qualified from their respective groups in the qualifiers. “We will start camping in Asaba June 7th and move to Egypt where we have to camp for a week in Ismailia, before moving to our city for the competition which is Alexandria.”
