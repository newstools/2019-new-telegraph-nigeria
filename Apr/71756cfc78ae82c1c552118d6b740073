The families of Nigeria’s tax master, boss of Nigeria’s Inland Revenue, Tunde Fowler and that of former Managing Director of Access Bank, Aigboje Aig-Imokhuede as you read, will still be basking in the euphoria of the marriage ceremony that made the families come together as one. Tunde Fowler’s daughter, Funke and Aigbovbiose, younger brother of Aigboje, recently got married in Lagos. The marriage ceremony had big wigs like Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as part of the anchor of the white wedding and Aliko Dangote. It was a significant one that has set the families over the moon. While Funke was involved in a marriage that crashed previously, Aig, on his part had long been due for marriage but didn’t show any sign he was thinking about it until his path crossed with Funke and the result is what the families, friends and well-wishers are now celebrating.
