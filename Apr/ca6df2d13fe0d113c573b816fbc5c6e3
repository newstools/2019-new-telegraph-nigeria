The management of University of Ibadan (UI) has dismissed insinuations that a former lecturer, Mr. Aminu Zubair, who died in his residence on the institution’s campus, committed suicide.  The Director of Communication of the university, Mr. Olatunji Oladejo, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ibadan on Saturday that Zubair died in a fire incident that occurred at his residence. Oladejo said if not for the timely intervention of the school’s Fire Service, the whole building would have been razed by the inferno. “He was a staff in the Department of Mathematics and had resigned before the ugly incident happened.  “It wasn’t a suicide attempt as he was caught up in the inferno at Phillipson Road, where he resides, and couldn’t escape. “If not for our Fire Service men, who got there at the right time the whole building would have been engulfed in fire completely.”
