Anthony Joshua has stated he could be wasting his time if Deontay Wilder doesn’t give him a shot at the World Boxing Council belt.
Joshua, who holds four straps of his own, wants an undisputed unification in 2019.
Talks have broken down twice previously and Joshua is hopeful Wilder will agree a deal this year.
Should Wilder happen, Joshua will then turn his attention to Oleksandr Usyk – if victorious.
“I think it will be class if I can fight Wilder for the undisputed title and then I could fight Usyk because then that would be the undisputed heavyweight champion versus the undisputed cruiserweight champion at heavyweight. That would be unbelievable,” Joshua told Sky Sports.
“I’ve done the Parker fight, I fought for that (WBO) title. I’ve fought Povetkin, now I’ve got to do Miller and I just need to get past this one.
“If I don’t get Wilder, what am I doing it for? If I don’t get my hands on the WBC belt, what am I doing it for? I really want that chance and that opportunity.”
Despite the heavyweight division being fragmented by the top three, Joshua found time to praise the current standing at 200 pounds plus.
“It’s really good because we’ve got me and Miller, Wilder vs Breazeale, Fury vs Schwarz, Dillian Whyte is going to do something, Usyk vs Takam,” he pointed out.
“The heavyweight division is alive. It is booming.”
