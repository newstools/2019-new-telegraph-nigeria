Following increasing unemployment figure among fresh graduates, the Federal Government has disclosed plans to include skills acquisition lessons in secondary school curriculum as well as National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) programme.
Disclosing this in Abuja, the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, Mr William Alo, also said the ministry was set to further deepen partnership with the African Development Bank (AfDB) on projects aimed at generating youth employment.
He spoke during “The Review of Country Strategy Papers (2013 – 2019) and Launch of the Preparations for the New Country Strategy Paper (2020 – 2024)’’ between AfDB and the ministry.
The permanent secretary said there was need for more funding for the two projects, which the ministry is in partnership with AfDB and proposed the inclusion of some intervention projects in the 2020 – 2024 Strategy Paper.
Recall that the ministry had been working in partnership with AfDB on the two projects since 2018, one of which is the public-private partnership for youth employment and skills development, aimed at implementing eight priority projects across relevant sectors.
He pointed out that the aim was also to boost massive job creation and skills development among the teeming unemployed youths in the country, stressing that other intention was to implement the labour content of an Inclusive Basic Services Delivery and Livelihood Empowerment Integrated Programme (IBSDLEIP) for livelihood enhancement and support for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the North East.
“The aim of the IBSDLEIP is to document the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the productive age and provide technical support to the participating states,’’ he said.
