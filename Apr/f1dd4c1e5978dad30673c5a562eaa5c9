Mr Blessing Emeloroh has been arrested in Warri, Delta State, for posing as an Army Major and receiving salutes from policemen, soldiers and air force personnel. Detectives at the Divisional Headquarters, Ekpan in Uvwie Local Government Area, led by a Superintendent of Police (SP), Ibok Asamanyi, swooped on the suspect after he gave an order to unsuspecting junior Air-Force personnel to shoot, which almost led to fatality. Fortunately, the incident was reported to the appropriate authority, leading to his arrest. It was thereafter discovered that the suspect, who hails from Isoko axis of the state, was a fake army major. He was alleged to have been posing as an army major for years. The Delta State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Chuks Orisewezie, said that the suspect had been making overtures in the past three years, to endear him to unsuspecting members of the public. Orisewezie said: “He had enjoyed ‘Espirit –decorps’ from members of the Armed Forces and the police. He has confessed to the crime. He has since been handed over to the State Criminal Intelligence and Investigations Department (SCIID), Asaba. He will be charged to court upon conclusion of investigation.”
