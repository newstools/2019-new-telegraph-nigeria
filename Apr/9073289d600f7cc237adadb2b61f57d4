The Senate, yesterday, refused to approve a motion seeking to recognize Kogi State as oil producing state. It argued that the apex legislative chamber lacked constitutional powers to delve into such proposal.  The Senate, however, urged the governors of Kogi, Anambra and Enugu states to meet and fashion out ways to resolve the lingering communal crises among communities claiming hosts to oil production within the three states. The chamber also urged the Federal Government to direct the National Boundary Commission to immediately release its report on the determination of the boundaries of the communities contiguous to OPLs 915 and 916. It further urged communities of Ibaji, Igga and Aguleri-Otu of Kogi, Enugu and Anambra states to sheathe their swords and allow peace to reign while the National Boundary Commission delineate the correct boundaries The Senate also urged the Federal Government to ensure that the displaced communities in the disputed area, due to the hostilities, were allowed to return to their ancestral homes and compensated for thei loss due to the crises.  Furthermore, the Upper chamber directed its committees on states and Local Governments, Petroleum Upstream, National Security and Intelligence to ensure compliance with the above resolutions. The lawmakers reached these resolutions following a motion, “need to recognize Kogi State as an oil producing state”, sponsored by Senator Isaac Alfa (PDP, Kogi East).
