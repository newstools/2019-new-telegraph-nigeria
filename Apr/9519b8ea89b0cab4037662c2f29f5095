A legislative group, Faculty Board of the Initiatives, made up of old and serving lawmakers yesterday advocated that legislators be allowed to choose their leaders without interference from political parties or other entities.  The group led by its ‘dean of faculty’ and former Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Hon. Eseme Eyiboh, made the call at a media briefing in Abuja. Eyibo, flanked by Hon. Nelson Alapa, Chris Eta, Ibrahim Buba and Chukwuemeka Ujam, explained that “in the current democratic system, where the rule of law prevails, it is the legislature as provided by section 4 of the constitution that make laws and as such, a critical arm of government in the tripod.”  He argued that if government or the three arms must stand in a tripod arrangement, then the legislature should be allowed to choose its leadership. According to him, in such critical contest, stakeholders must begin a talent hunt to get the best, especially for the positions of Senate President, Speaker, House of Representatives.  He noted that history can vindicate past succession challenges, specifically from the times of Ghali Nabba, Dimeji Bankole, Aminu Tambuwal and the current speaker, Yakubu Dogara, where the independence of the legislature played a role, cautioning that such precedence cannot be jettisoned or allowed not to be the norm.  “History, from Nabba up to Dogara, is very consistent,” he added, pointing out that the “general interest of a particular candidate and the independence of the legislature have often been uppermost in the heart of the lawmakers in choosing their leaders
