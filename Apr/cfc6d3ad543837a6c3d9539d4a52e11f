A lawmaker-elect for Bende North State constituency, Abia State, Hon. Chijioke Chukwu has said that a senatorelect for Abia North and former governor of Abia State, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu had the requisite exposure, reach and experience to be the president of the 9th senate. Chukwu, who defeated the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate and incumbent deputy speaker of the Abia State House of Assembly, Dr. Cosmos Ndukwe, said that if Kalu was made the senate president it would balance the tripod of the national political equation. He explained that since the North had the presidency, the west with Vice Presidency, the South-East should be considered for the senate presidency in the spirit of fairness and justice. He, however, expressed hope that although the APC party leadership had zoned the leadership of the National Assembly it may not be the final. Chukwu said: “There is still horse trading in the National Assembly though the party hierarchy has zoned the offices which is not the final. We still have two months of horse trading. It will be a disaster if South East is neglected. Nigeria is a tripod of Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba. If one is neglected it will be dicey for the country. “The only way to assuage the feeling of marginalization and separatist agitations among the Igbo is to give the zone senate president or deputy.” He said that Kalu’s insistence on having at least the deputy senate president was in tandem with the expectation of majority of Nigerians and even the international community.”
