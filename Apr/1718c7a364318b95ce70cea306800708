About 1,500 residents of Anambra State will benefit from the ongoing all-Anambra free and comprehensive medical outreach programme by Chief Osita Chidoka. The outreach, which was flagged-off by the benefactor and former Aviation Minister, Chief Osita Chidoka, at Obosi in Idemili North Local Government Area, was targeted at all the 179 communities of the state, beginning with Obosi. It covers wide range of medical conditions, including malaria and typhoid tests, hepatitis/ retroviral screening, full medical checks, blood pressure checks and diabetes screening, comprehensive eye checks with glasses, among other presentations. Chidoka, who was on hand to perform the flag-off, said it was part of the ways he was giving back to the society and it gave him exceeding joy to put smiles on people’s faces, especially those who could not help themselves. The former minister and chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said his late grandfather, Thomas Chidoka, was an amputee who lost one of his limbs in his days as a soldier in the Second World War (WW2). But that the British government consistently replaced the artificial limb every three years which also enabled him to earn a living from which he was able to train 12 children, including his own father. He added that he had been doing the medical programme silently for years but had now reached out to Anambra State citizens in the diaspora and even corporate organisations who had positively welcomed the idea to be part of the programme. According to him, it’s going to be continuous and will cover all communities in the state. Chidoka said they would follow- up and assist critical cases that needed surgeries and further reference.
