The position of a First Lady is not recognised by law in Nigerian but it is well celebrated, because governors’ wives command lots of influence at the state level, especially from politicians seeking favours.  Though a governor-elect in a particular state is yet to be sworn into office, but he has started behaving like ‘His Excellency’ dictating many things in the state and the action of the governor has also led to the awaiting ‘First Lady’ dominating and controlling the political space ahead of the inauguration.  In fact, the awaiting ‘Her Excellency’ is in-charge now, arrogantly dictating and swaying some decisions to her side. Few weeks ago, the incoming ‘First Lady’ was spotted at a political meeting addressing some party leaders on what her husband will do when he is eventually sworn in.  But worried by the action of the incoming ‘Margaret Thatcher’, some of the party leaders believe that she had been sending wrong signals on the way the government would be ran. Her overbearing attitude recently got to a crescendo, to the extent that a party leader threatened to walk her out of a recent meeting, to the surprise of the husband and others around.
