Rivers State Internal Revenue Services (RIRS) and the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) are at loggerheads over an alleged N50 billion the revenue body claimed the commission owed it. Armed with an ex-parte order in July 2018, RIRS had stormed the commission’s headquarters and sealed off it premises over N600 million unpaid taxes after it had carried out a picketing action three months earlier.  But in a new twist, RIRS claimed that NDDC owed the state government N50 billion and decided to seal the gates of the commission headquarters. It claimed that several efforts to get the money from the NDDC failed, so it sent its enforcement team to the commission to drive home the point that NDDC “cannot continue to operate in the state without paying taxes.” But NDDC, through its Director, Corporate Affairs, Charles Obi Odili, dismissed the amount, explaining that the commission had not defaulted in meeting its tax obligations to RIRS.  Odili said in a statement; “The commission is surprised that the state revenue agency is claiming an outstanding N50 billion. Our records show that this is not correct. “It is rather curious that the RIRS would rush to seal the gates of the commission, disrupting activities at its headquarters, without any form of notification. “We have had cause to discuss our tax obligations with officials of the RIRS in the past and all the grey areas were resolved amicably. It is, therefore, an act of bad faith for the revenue agency to begin to take actions that impugns on the reputation of an interventionist agency that is serving the people of the Niger Delta region.
