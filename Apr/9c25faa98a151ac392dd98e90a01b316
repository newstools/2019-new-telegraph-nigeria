The management of the Shooting Stars Sports Club of Ibadan has appealed to their fans of the club to remain calm and hope for the best at the end of the season.
The Oluyole Warriors commenced their campaign for promotion to the elite league on a shaky note after they were held to a 1-1 draw by visiting Abia Comets of Umuahia, in a Nigeria National League Match Day One encounter decided at the Lekan Salami Stadium, Ibadan, on Wednesday.
As xpected, the result did not go down well with some of the club’s fans who openly showed their displeasure over the outcome of the encounter.
The management, in a press release, expressed unhappiness with the result even as it appreciated the fans for their concern but appealed to them to believe in the team.
“We want to use this medium to apologise to our teeming fans over our inability to secure the maximum points against Abia Comets,” the statement read.
“We can understand their feelings, they expected victory from us but we failed to deliver, so their reaction, we know was borne out of their love for the club.
“On behalf of the players, we are sincerely sorry and we want to assure them that our dream of making it back to the Nigeria Professional Football League is still alive.”
The management further called for calm from the fans, saying that the team will return to the drawing board ahead of their next game which is an away trip to Giant Briller in Enugu.
