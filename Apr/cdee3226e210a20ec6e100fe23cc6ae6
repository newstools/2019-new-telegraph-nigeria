 Super Eagles midfielder, Kelechi Nwakali, has received a strong ray of hope that he should be on his way back to his Portuguese club FC Porto this week, following several weeks of failing to get a visa that would enable him to leave Nigeria, since travelling home on March 20. Nwakali has been stranded since travelling home to play for the Olympic Eagles in their Africa U-23 Cup of Nations qualifiers away and home with Libya but, after several setbacks in the process of renewing his papers, he has now gained support from Nigeria Football Federation. NFF’s Director of Communications, Ademola Olajire, said officials at the GlassHouse were working hard to secure the visa that will enable Nwakali to return to Portugal, where he is on loan from Arsenal FC, England. “The federation has been working hard to get his visa sorted as quickly as possible, but it’s taking longer than expected. “We hope it will come out after the Easter break so he will return to Portugal,” Olajire said. Nwakali has made 16 appearances this season for Porto’s reserve side, who play in the Iberian country’s second division league, but he has now missed the club’s last four matches. Ironically, Nwakali was upbeat in joining the Olympic Eagles, as he sees playing in the team as an opportunity to sell himself in the upcoming summer market, following dwindling fortunes at Porto. The 20-year-old, who had previously been on loan from Arsenal at MVV Maastricht and VV Venlo of Holland, is struggling to make his mark in Porto’s B team, despite initially being touted for their main squad.
