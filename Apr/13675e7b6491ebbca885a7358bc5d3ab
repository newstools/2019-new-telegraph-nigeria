A houseboy, Joseph Ode Monday Ogede, has disappeared after stabbing his colleague to death at the Magodo Phase 2 GRA area of Lagos State. Ogede was said to have been sacked by his employer after he had a misunderstanding with the security guard. It was learnt that after being sacked, Ogede returned to the house on Saturday, claiming that he wanted to pick the remaining of his property. The body of the security guard was later discovered in a pool of blood after Ogede had fled. The guard was stabbed to death with a knife, said detectives from the Homicide Section of the Lagos State Police Command. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Bala Elkana, said the suspect had been declared wanted by the police. According to Elkana, the police are trailing the suspect and will surely apprehend him soon, so that he can face the wrath of the law. He added: “The suspect had issue with the security guard when he was still working in the residence. He returned to the house, pretending that he wanted to take some of his belongings, which he left in the house. Nobody knew that he had an ulterior motive; that he came on a revenge mission against the guard. He was able to murder the guard and escape.” It was learnt that even as police man-hunt for the suspect gets underway, Ogede’s former employer has promised a handsome reward for anyone with useful information on how to arrest him. The information has also been shared on different social media sites, with a photograph of Ogede. Meanwhile, it was learnt that the murdered security guard was a father and husband.
