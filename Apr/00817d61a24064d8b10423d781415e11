 Lagos State Governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode and the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Lagos, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe yesterday charged over 100,000 workers in the state to be selfless with a view to reaching the pinnacle of their career.
Speaking at a two-day training programme tagged ‘Team Building and Synergy Workshop for Peak Performance’ organised by the Lagos State Ministry of Establishments, Training and Pensions in conjunction with Messrs Human Capital Management and Solutions Limited, the duo said only those with spirit of teamwork and cooperation would succeed in the service. According to Ambode, who spoke through Commissioner for Establishments, Training and Pensions, for the state to move to the next level of development, its workforce must develop a team spirit and show commitment to the development of the state.
He said: “Finally, please reflect on this profound quotation: “Teamwork can be likened to two compounds, almost essential to modern life. It’s the glue which keeps a team together, a bond which promotes strength, unity, reliability and support.
“Teamwork is also the oil that makes the team work. It can enable smoother movement towards targets, can prolong forward momentum, and can help teams to overcome obstacles. Teamwork has the potential to underpin so much of what is valuable in work. In fact, maximised performance cannot be achieved without the teamwork synergies that are essential for effective organisational growth.” On his part, Ogundipe identified synergy as the solution to underdevelopment of any organization or society, saying if the people work and reason together, they will achieve all their targets.
The varsity don called for an approach that not only enabled efficiency, growth and value for money, but also accomplished strategic goals linked to a broader understanding of sustainability, cutting across both environmental and social objectives.
