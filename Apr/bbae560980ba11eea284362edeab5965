Kano State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday suspended its planned protest against the alleged unlawful arrest, detention, intimidation, harassment and threat to life of members of the party by the ruling All Progressive Congress, Kano State government and security agencies in the state.  The party through a release signed by its governorship candidate’s spokesman, Sanusi Bature, said it decided to suspend the peaceful protest against the backdrop of noticing a relative progress over their concern on alleged violation of our members’ fundamental human rights.  The party said: “The Department of State Services (DSS) had on Tuesday released two of our members, Salisu Yahaya Hotoro and Babangida Bangis, who were unlawfully detained for twelve days.  “We want to clearly state that no amount of pressure will deter PDP as the leading opposition party from giving constructive criticism capable of promoting democracy. Our members will continue to enjoy the freedom of expression as provided by section 39 (A) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as amended. “It is with deep concern and displeasure that we condemn the gruesome attempts by the ruling APC and Kano State government under the leadership of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, to humiliate members of the opposition through blatant abuse of the principles of human right.  “It is a known fact that some members of the APC government had issued threats to a number of PDP members, notable among them are the state PDP Women Leader, Hajiza Zainab Audu Bako, media aide to Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, Hajia Binta and Mr. Sanusi Bature Dawakin-Tofa, who serves as the spokesperson to PDP governorship candidate, Abba K. Yusuf, Salisu Yahaya Hotoro and Babangida Bangis, among others. Our party members no longer feel secured as they are being inundated with series of frivolous accusations of one thing or the other at police stations and courts.
