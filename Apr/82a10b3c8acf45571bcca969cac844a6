Justice Mojisola Olatoregun of a Federa High Court in Lagos yesterday heard oral evidences in a suit filed by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) seeking final forfeiture of the sums of $8.4 million and N9.2 billion allegedly linked to a former First Lady, Dame Patience Jonathan, to the Federal Government. At yesterday’s proceedings, the EFCC called two of its officers that investigated the case to testify in court. In his testimony, one of the officers, Chukwuma Orji, told the court that investigations were launched into the case following an intelligence report received by the commission. While being examined by EFCC’s lawyer, Rotimi Oyedepo, the witness dismissed claims by some of the respondents that the funds being sought to be forfeited were proceeds of sales of some items.
