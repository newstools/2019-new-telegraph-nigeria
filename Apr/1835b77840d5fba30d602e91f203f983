With a father like the richest black man, it is not subject to debate that Halima, the first daughter of Alhaji Aliko Dangote, would have access to whatever money can buy. Among what money can buy which this lady has taken advantage of is a good education she got from some of the best schools around the world. And for a father, nothing will make him happy to see his investment on his children yield desired result and this is exactly the case of this Kano State-born money bag, Dangote, as far as his kids are concerned. Halima and her two sisters, one can conveniently say have remained a reference point among children of the rich as they have done everything possible to stay away from whatever that is capable of smearing their father’s image. As far as Halima is concerned, she’s leaving no stone unturned to ensure she’s on top of whatever she does even as she’s fast taking after her father’s ways. In the area of philanthropy, only cynics will underrate what Halima is doing through her foundation. Also, as an executive director in her father’s business empire, she is doing impressively well such that she now represents her father at different business forums. What has been noticed to make it clear she’s really living it up is how she has also assumed the role of standing in for her father at social gatherings where he can’t be present. Recently at Segun Awolowo’s daughter’s wedding, where Dangote, an ally of the bride’s father was avoidably absent, with Halima making it down in place of her father, it could be said the father’s absence was actually not regretted as she stood in perfectly for her father as her great carriage, mien and personality all came into play to give her a nice outing.
