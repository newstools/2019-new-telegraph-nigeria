Nigeria’s Super Eagles stand to return home with $4.5m (N1.6bn) should they emerge winners of this year’s Africa Cup of Nations, as the prize money for the continental soccer showpiece has been increased, in order to reflect the expansion to 24 competing countries. This was revealed by the President of Confederation of African Football, Ahmad Ahmad, who confirmed that the winner of AFCON 2019 in Egypt would take home the equivalent of four million euros, in addition to the trophy, after the final on July 19. For winning the 2017 edition, Cameroon got $4m, while the runnersup, Egypt, received $2m, with the two losing semifinalists, Burkina Faso and Ghana, both going home with $1.5m each. However, Ahmad said all accruable fees had been increased across board, considering that, for the first time in the competition’s history, 24 teams will participate, with more matches to be staged and aired on television, which will bring additional revenue to CAF. Ahmad further disclosed that all countries competing at this summer’s competition will receive at least $600,000 each, adding, ”Obviously, we increased the prize money for the competition.”
