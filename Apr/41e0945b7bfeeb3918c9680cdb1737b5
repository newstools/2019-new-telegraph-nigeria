Police yesterday said they had arrested two students of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), Enugu for allegedly attempting to kidnap a man, Chinedu Odenigbo, of Angwan Kadara Maitumbi area of Minna, Niger State. The incident was reported to the police on April 18, by a man, Emenike Odenigbo, of Maitumbi area in Minna, that he met two strange men he suspected to be kidnappers around his compound with his sick son, Chinedu. The suspects, Onwan Onyedika (20) and Eze Athanasius (27), both from Enugu State, were trailed and arrested by police detectives attached to Maitumbi Division following a tip-off. It was learnt that the suspects took to crime to make quick money. Sources said the suspects came from Abuja in company with Emenike’s younger brother, Sunday Odenigbo, now at large to perfect the act before it was foiled by police operatives in Minna. Onyedika, a 400 level student of UNN, told our correspondent that he was invited by Sunday Odenigbo, who is a 500 level student of the same university, to accompany him to his brother’s house in Minna to steal money. He said: “Sunday told me that he wanted to start one business while in school and begged me to follow him to his brother’s house in Minna to rob him otherwise he will not give him the money and I accompanied him. “I don’t know what pushed to this act. I never knew that my friend, Sunday, had ulterior motives. To be sincere, I followed him to rob his brother not to kidnap his son; God knows about that. “I have disappointed my late father. I don’t have reasons to get involved in this mess I have found myself. How can I face my poor mother after disappointing her? I have ruined my life.” The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Muhammad Abubakar, said the suspect would soon be charged to court.
