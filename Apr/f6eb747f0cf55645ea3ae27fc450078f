The emergence of internet and high cost of operations has crippled courier firms including Tranex Plc. Chris Ugwu reports  The coming on stream of internet and the accompanying social media networks like Facebook, Twitter, e-mail, and the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) has caused earnings of courier companies in Nigeria to be shrinking gradually.
In place of letters, people now connect with each other via telephone calls, text messages, e-mails, twitter, facebook and other social media networks.
News breaks spread across the world in seconds through social media networks and less people bother with post office services and other courier services.
In Nigeria, like any other country of the world, e-commerce has taken a new shape with the emergence and increasing popularity of local online retail stores like jumia.com, konga.com, Mystore.com.ng among others.
With the increase of internet penetration and customer awareness, volume of online trades has also significantly increased, thereby leading to more competition among courier and logistic service providers in the country.
In addition, bad road network in Nigeria remains a major challenge facing courier and logistics providers.
Others challenges include inconsistent government policies in form of multiple taxation, conflicts of interest from government agencies as regulators and operators, duplicity of functions, poor import and export information on rights, obligations, privileges, among others.
The situation has negatively impacted Tranex Plc’s activities like others as its financials have remained on the decline.
Though with profit growth in second and third quarter of 2018, the courier firm slipped into loss position during the financial year ended December 2018 to what market watchers believe was induced by harsh operating milieu.
They are also worried that eventual passage of the Nigeria Postal Commission Bill by the National Assembly might worsen the earnings of courier industry in the country.

According to the Managing Director, Crane Securities Limited, Mr. Mike Eze, the current challenges logistic companies are facing is a reflection of total state of the economy.
“If the economy does very well, it will also benefit from it. If the power sector runs very well, production will improve substantially, there will be more goods to deliver from one location to another.
“The industry is not operating in isolation of the rest of the economy; the logistic companies are part of it. They oil the machine of distribution from the point of production to the level of consumption. They play the role of intermediaries from the time the raw materials are sourced to the end production.
“As the middle men, whatever happens at the two ends, they will take a share of it, whether they do well or not. To a large extent, the industry needs re-organisation, but it does not imply they are not contributing to the economy,” he noted.
An independent shareholder, Mr. Peter Bassy, said the inability of the privatised power sector to increase output as envisaged, as a result of issues with gas supply and power distribution, rising inflation cost and decaying infrastructure, continue to pose great challenges to businesses in the country resulting in maintenance and operations cost.
He also added that significant drop in government revenue and distortions in foreign exchange market led to the depreciation of naira in the period under review.
This, according to him, resulted in higher cost for all the company’s international operations Way forward
The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) had warned against the passage of the Nigeria Postal Commission Bill in its current form, saying such was capable of jeopardising about N300 billion investments in the courier services business.
Director General of LCCI, Mr. Muda Yusuf, while cautioning against the anti-investor friendly bill in a report, said it negateed the Ease of Doing Business agenda of the Federal Government and not in consonant with the fundamental principles of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), which seeks to promote and incentivise private sector investment.
LCCI equally raised the alarm that the passage of the bill in its current form would put over 100,000 jobs in the courier sector at risk, adding that this would further worsen the country’s risk rating as the country is already grappling with enormous perception problems by investors.
LCCI maintained that the bill, which is currently before the National Assembly and has been passed by the Senate, while also awaiting concurrence by the House of Representatives, should be halted and the hurtful provisions expunged.
It pointed out that it was particularly worried about some provisions of the bill, which included imposition of an annual levy of 2.5 per cent of the turnover of courier companies to be paid to the proposed Postal Services Commission (PSC); powers conferred on the proposed PSC to fix rates for courier services and monopoly privilege conferred on the Nigerian Postal Service for delivery of items weighing one kilogramme and below.
‘‘All these provisions are not consistent with the espoused commitment of the National Assembly to private sector development, which was affirmed by the Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, at the inauguration of the National Assembly Business Environment Roundtable (NASSBER) in March 2016.
“No sector of the Nigerian economy is subjected to such an arduous regulatory provision. We request that the bill be urgently reviewed by the National Assembly in the interest of economic progress and the welfare of citizens,’’ LCCI advised. Last line
Despite challenges like the emergence of social media networks and e-commerce, which is crippling the courier sector, high cost of operations has also taken a toll on the earnings of the industry.
