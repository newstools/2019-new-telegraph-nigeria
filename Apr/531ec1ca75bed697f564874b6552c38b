 A former Super Eagles skipper, Joseph Yobo, has told the current players in the team that they do not need much experience to win the Africa Cup of Nations trophy in Egypt. He urged the players to believe in themselves and go out to create history at the elite continental football competition. Speaking on a BBC interview monitored by our correspondent in Abuja yesterday, the 2013 AFCON winner stated that the squad must learn from the 2013 squad and go all out to make their own history despite having a relatively inexperienced squad. “From my experience as a former captain, no one gave us a chance in 2013 including myself. When the squad was released, I told the coach that there were not enough experienced players in this team because we had younger stars merged with very few experienced ones but we won it.  “I have been in the team when we had a very good squad and were one of the Top-Two for the title but we did not win, so going back to what is happening with this squad and with what I’m seeing, they have a blend of experienced players, some of them played with me and are very experienced now,” Yobo said. He continued by urging the young players to show plenty of character and seize the opportunity when given a chance to represent the nation in Egypt. “With the younger players coming in, they can go and win it, they have the capacity, they have the quality they just have to show a lot of character and determination to get it right,” Yobo stressed.  The former Everton of England defender remains Nigeria’s most capped outfield player with 101 one caps spanning between 2001 and 2014. He represented the country at three editions of the World Cup and six AFCON tournaments, lifting the trophy in South Africa six years ago.
