Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani-Bello, has called on non-governmental organisations in the state to support and complement government’s effort at developing healthcare delivery and education in the state, especially at the grassroots.  The governor made the call when Mainstream Foundation, a non-governmental organisation, paid him a courtesy visit in his office in Minna, the state capital.  He said the need for people at all levels to have access to education and health facilities in their communities informed government’s decision to provide primary healthcare facilities in each of the 274 wards in the state so as to bring healthcare facilities as well as education closer to the people. “As a government, we are doing all we can, especially in the areas of education and health in the rural areas where mortality rate is high.  With the intervention of non-governmental organisations and foundations like the Mainstream Foundation, we can make meaningful progress. “Niger State is the largest and we need to do more. A lot of communities have been cut off. We have a lot of school children that don’t go to school and a lot of women that don’t go to hospitals to deliver, all because Niger State is wide. We have not been able to cover every corner. We need to take healthcare facilities and schools closer to communities.”
