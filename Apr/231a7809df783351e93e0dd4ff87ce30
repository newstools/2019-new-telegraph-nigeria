Nigerian Radio-TV personality and entrepreneur, Toke Makinwa, says the fear of self criticism prevents her from listening to her radio presentations or watching her own movies and TV shows. She said this during an interview recently, while sharing experiences that trailed her recent foray into the Nigerian film industry. “I never listen to my radio presentations; I never watch my TV shows. But it’s going to be quite interesting watching ‘Makate Must Sell’ at the cinemas because I just don’t do it. “I watched an interview with Denzel Washington when he said he’s never watched any movie he’s been in and I could totally understand because I’m my biggest critic. I think when you’re done with one, you move to the next. “I’m only hoping that fans remain open-minded and love the characters as much as I do. You know, because everyone has a friend or sister like the characters I play. I hope that people will go to the cinema in numbers and stay entertained.”
