Police have launched a manhunt for a middleaged farmer, Oladosu Nureni, who allegedly shot dead two persons at Iwoye community in Yewa South Local Government Area of Ogun State. The suspect, who reportedly shot his victims in separate attacks, has also allegedly threatened to kill eight more people. The slain victims, who are prominent members of the agrarian community, are Ajayi Onifade and Olatunji Ayinla. It was learnt yesterday that the assailant had been on the prowl in the community after attacking his victims and threatened to kill anyone who attempts to apprehend him. The incident, according to a resident, occurred on Wednesday, last week, and has forced many residents to flee the community. It was reported at the Ilaro Police Division. A source, who pleaded anonymity, told our correspondent yesterday that Nureni, whose house is a stone throw from Onifade’s house, shot the man at close range while mounting his motorcycle en route to his farm on Wednesday morning. Onifade, who was the Amuludun of Iwoye, was said to have died on Friday night at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Idi-Aba, Abeokuta, where he was taken for treatment. The source added that the fleeing suspect shot dead Ayinla during a manhunt for him by some members of the community. Speaking with our correspondent yesterday, Onifade’s eldest child, Seyi, said though the matter was immediately reported at the Ilaro Police Division, the suspect had not been apprehended.
