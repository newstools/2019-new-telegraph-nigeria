The shift in consumer patterns in the light of the economic situation in Nigeria and corresponding squeeze on disposal income have continued to take their tolls on the earnings of Nigerian Breweies Plc. Chris Ugwu writes  Following the challenging macro-environment and the squeeze on household wallets, growth in the mainstream segment of beer industry has been constrained, with more growth seen among cheaper brands.
Notable among the changes to the architecture of alcohol business in the country is the rising to prominence of a new variant of alcoholic drinks, which mixes bitters with spirit.
For instance, the introduction of Alomo Bitters produced by a Ghanaian company, Kasapreko Limited, in Accra, led the charge of this category of beverages, which in Nigeria today are Action Bitters, Bajinotu, Origin Bitters, Agbara Bitters, Osomo Bitters, among others. This led the market share of all other alcoholic brands to be re-configured, making the beer brands to suffer a significant loss of market.
To this end, the financial results of some of the companies in the sector have not been encouraging and the expectations were that the subsequent results will be brighter enough to erase the negatives in the accounts but unfortunately the trend has continued unabated.
Coupled with increased excise duty rates, Nigerian Breweries Plc like its peers has not been unable to sustain its performance despite innovative and proactive responses to market dynamics and competitive pressures.
Analysts are also forecasting slow down in earnings, as operating environment remains challenging due to an increasingly competitive landscape.
Despite that it remains among tops in the industry, Nigeria Breweries share price movements has receded and remained susceptible to the challenges facing the manufacturing businesses in Nigeria due to the upset in financial sector.
The company had its fair share from the current lull in the market following massive profit taking that saw the market lose considerable chunk of investors’ wealth. The share price, which closed at N107.90 per share in May 31, 2018, stood at N64.65 when the closing bell rang last Friday, a decrease of N43.25 or 40.08 per cent year to date. Financials
Nigerian Breweries Plc began the year 2018 unimpressive with a profit after tax of N10.2 billion for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.
The unaudited and provisional results released to the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) showed that the N10.2 billion represents 11.8 per cent decrease over the N11.4 billion recorded in the corresponding period in 2017.
The company’s revenue dipped by nine per cent from N91.3 billion in 2017 to N83.0 billion in the current period. In a filing statement to the NSE by the Board of Directors, the brewer stated, “while there are some signs of improvement in the macroeconomic conditions, these are yet to be reflected in consumer spending.”
Further analysis showed that results from operating activities declined by eight per cent from N19.2 billion in 2017 to N17.7 billion in the corresponding months in 2018. Profit before Tax also dropped by 12.6 per cent from N17.4 billion in 2017 to N15.2 billion in the period under review.
Nigerian Breweries sustained decline profile with record of a profit after tax of N18.434 billion for the first half of 2018, according to the unaudited financial results released to the Exchange.
The N18 billion represents a 22 per cent decrease over the N23.751 billion recorded in the corresponding period in 2017.
An analysis of the filing sent to The Exchange indicated that the company’s revenue dipped by 5 per cent from N181 billion in the same period in 2017 to N173 billion in the current period.
A further analysis of the statement show that results from operating activities declined by 20 per cent from N39 billion in 2017 to N32 billion in the corresponding months in 2018, just as Profit before Tax also dropped by 19 per cent from N34 billion in 2017 to N28 billion in the period under review. Cost of sales stood at N96.578 billion in 2018 from N99.176 billion in 2017, while administrative expenses rose to N10.343 billion from N9.407 billion in 2017.
Similarly, Nigerian Breweries Plc 9M’18 top line declined by 6.5 per cent YoY to N238.1 billion. In the same vein, after-tax earnings dipped significantly by 38.4 per cent YoY to N14.8 billion.
According to analysts at CardinalStone, given the unimpressive 9M’18 financial result, the company cut its interim dividend by 40.0 per cent YoY to N0.60/share. This represents a dividend yield of 0.7 per cent on current price of N88.0.
“In Q3’18, NB’s net revenue slumped by 11.2 per cent YoY to N65.4 billion. According to the parent company, Heineken, beer volume declined high-single digit, attributable to increased competitive pressure. “We are not surprised by this development, given INTBREW’s aggressive strategy to grow volumes in recent times, through expansion and competitive pricing. In addition, we note the significant impact of higher excise duty tax (+31.2 per cent YoY) on overall sales,” the experts stated.
“Notwithstanding, cost-of-sales declined at a slower pace (-3.2 per cent YoY)—driving the cost-to-sales ratio to a high of 71.5 per cent (vs. Q2’18: 54.2 per cent Q1’18: 57.6 per cent, FY’17: 58.3 per cent). In our recent note, Amidst competitive pressures, we mentioned that NB was a cost leader in the brewery industry, and as such, anticipated that the company could absorb some costs to retain attractive price points and had projected an increase in cost-of-sales to 65.0 per cent in Q3’18 (6.5 ppts less than actual of 71.5 per cent).
“We note that the company’s gross profit for the period (N18.6 billion) was not sufficient to cover its operating expenses of N22.7 billion for the period, which resulted to an operating loss of N3.9 billion. This coupled with net finance cost amounting to N1.2 billion, resulted to a loss-before-tax of N5.1 billion in Q3’18 (vs. Q3’17 PBT: N400 million).
“However, the company recorded a tax credit of N1.4 billion during the quarter, which moderated loss-after-tax to N3.6 billion (vs. Q3’17 PAT: N300 million).”
For the financial year ended December, 2018, the brewer announced a profit after tax of N19.4 billion for the 2018 Financial Year. According to the audited financial results released to The Exchange, the Company also made a Revenue of N324.4 billion during the period.
The 2018 Profit after Tax was lower than the N31.6 billion recorded in 2017, representing a 41 per cent decline, while the Revenue also dipped from the N344.5 billion recorded in 2017, a six per cent decline.
According to analysts FBNQuest Research, “Nigerian Breweries’ (NB) Q4 2018 earnings missed our forecasts because of negative surprises in gross margin and net interest expense. The results suggest that headwinds were most pressing in 2018, as NB recorded its worst sales (-6 per cent y/y) and PBT (-37 per cent y/y) declines since 1998.”
According to management, the company suffered 4-6 per cent volume losses caused by stronger competitive headwinds in the value lager segment (where NB has its highest exposure).
The Company also began the 2019 financial year on the decline, as the first quarter ended March 2019 showed a Profit after Tax of N8 billion, lower than the N10.2 billion recorded in the same period in 2018, signifying a 21.4 per cent decline.
The statement signed by the Company Secretary/Legal Director, Uaboi Agbebaku, said that the increase in net Revenue was offset by higher excise duty following the excise duty regime introduced in 2018. Cost of Sales increased by 7.3 per cent primarily driven by Raw Materials and Consumables while Marketing and Distribution expenses increased 7.9 per cent over the same period in 2018.
Administrative Expenses reduced by 12 per cent, partially driven by the right sizing exercise undertaken by the Company in Q3, 2018. The impact of inflation and currency devaluation was minimized by the continued focus on cost efficiencies delivered through Cost Leadership initiatives. Profit deflators /outlook
According to Agbebaku, the company’s the 2018 results were adversely impacted by the increased excise duty rates that came into effect during the year and a challenging operating environment.
He noted that the 2019 operating environment so far, has shown similarities with the difficult environment witnessed in 2018. Notwithstanding, the Board remains confident that it has a clear strategy to deliver good return on investment.
To analysts at FBNQuest, although double-digit volume growth was realised from NB’s premium lager segment, this did not drive overall volume growth given the segment’s lighter weighting in the brand portfolio. NB’s market share was particularly challenged by International Breweries’ (IB) expansion into the south-west. On top of this, the company’s woes were further compounded by an excise tax increase that was not passed on.” Over our forecast period, we see IB’s aggressive pricing strategy, particularly in value larger, posing a key challenge to NB’s performance,” the experts said.

Though operational challenges have remarkably weighed down on the manufacturing sector, it is pertinent for the company to continue to manage its cost base tightly to deliver moderate operating margins improvement for growth and profitability.
