Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has bruised aside allegation that he had instructed his Kogi State counterpart, Governor Yahaya Bello to dump the All Progressive Congress (APC) and pitch tent in the Accord Party (AP). Governor Ortom who made the denial during an interaction with journalists at the government house, also ruled out insinuation that he was plotting to dump the PDP back to the ruling All Progressive Congress, APC after winning his second term on the platform of the PDP. The governor said he is not in speaking terms with Governor Bello and has nothing to do with Kogi politics as the problems confronting his administration were enough challenges for him to handle. “I did not instruct the Governor of Kogi State to defect from APC to Accord Party. I have nothing to do with Kogi politics, the problems I am facing here in Benue are enough for me. Even on the issue of open grazing law, I have never asked other states to emulate Benue”. He likened the allegation of his defection to the APC to going back to eat his vomit. “I cannot go back to my vomit, PDP is my real home, PDP is my party. I supported the party to where it is today”. “In PDP, I was its National Auditor, I was Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, I was also Supervising Minister of Aviation, I won my second term on the platform of the PDP and so there is no basis whatsoever saying that I am planning to defect to APC again”. “I have been fully integrated into the PDP now and I believe that is the handiwork of the APC”, said Governor Ortom.
