On the inauguration, the Minister of Youth and Sports, Solomon Dalung, charged the MOC to be committed and let history be repeated through a successful hosting of the 2020 National Sports Festival. Dalung said: “I am entrusting this mandate in your custody believing that as we wind down, the transition process shall in no way affect the build-up and preparation for the next Festival. “I challenge you to look at service to humanity and the future and bear in mind the development of this great country. “It is also the responsibility of the MOC to educate Nigerians with advocacy, to appreciate the significance of the NSF and sports in national development. Sports has moved from recreation to big business. We must therefore use sports to promote peace and unity in Nigeria.” In his acceptance speech, the Permanent Secretary, Adesola thanked the Minister on behalf of the MOC for the opportunity to serve.
