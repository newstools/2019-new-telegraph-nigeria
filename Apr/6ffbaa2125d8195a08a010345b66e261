Former Nigerian international, Sam Sodje, has urged the Super Eagles to show mental strength in their bid to claim the African Cup of Nations despite making a return after six years. The former defender, said the bunch of players in the team were good to go but must believe in themselves and play as a unit to ensure they triumph over the continent’s best in Egypt. “Definitely, the Nations Cup is winnable because we have the players that can deliver the goods for us and I believe if they play as a team and believe in their abilities, then they can repeat the success of 2013 in South Africa. “Individually you look at this current crop of players and find plenty of amazing talents, though young. I believe if the right mind-set is instilled in them before the tournament then they could go on and win yet another trophy for Nigeria,” Sodje told AOIFootball. com. He, however, added that with the expansion from 16 to 24, the competition would definitely be tougher but still believes in the Nigerian team as they have continued to improve game by game since their group stage exit from the World Cup in Russia.
