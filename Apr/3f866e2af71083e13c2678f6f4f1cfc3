As the lunch of fifth generation network (5G) gains traction across the world, research firm, Strategy Analytics has forecast a growth in 5G smartphone shipment to hit 5 million this year. In Nigeria, mobile network operators are also putting machineries in motion for the next generation network, despite the fact that 4G spread is still limited to cities. The research firm noted that early 5G smartphone models will be expensive and available in limited volumes, while manufacturers such as Samsung, LG and Huawei will be the early 5G smartphone leaders in 2019, followed by Apple in 2020. Despite the market’s weak short-term outlook, its long-term opportunity looks promising, it said. The researchers forecast 1 billion 5G smartphones will ship worldwide per year by 2025 as the introduction of 5G networks by carriers like Verizon or China Mobile opens up high-speed, ultra-low-latency services such as 8K video, streaming games, and augmented reality for business. “Less than 1 percent of all smartphones shipped worldwide will be 5G-enabled in 2019,” the researchers said. “Global 5G smartphone shipments are tiny for now, due to expensive device pricing, component bottlenecks, and restricted availability of active 5G networks.”
