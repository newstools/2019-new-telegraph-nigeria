Golden Eaglets coach, Manu Garba, has harsh words for his players after they survived the scare in the 5-4 victory over Tanzania in their opening match of the CAF U-17 African Cup of Nations on Sunday. The Nigerian side squandered a 3-1 first half lead and had to dig deep before they secured a 5-4 victory at the end of the enthralling encounter. Although Garba was grateful his wards dug out the win, he was unimpressed by the profligacy and loss of concentration. “First of all, I must have to congratulate our opponents for giving us a good fight,” he said after the match. “Having said that, we were 3-1 up in the first half but it could have been 8,9. I was very furious with the boys when they came to the dressing room. “There were some unpardonable misses in the first half but even then we told them that we are just starting the match, let them go to the second half as if they have not scored but unfortunately, like what my colleague said, youth at times you tell them this and they’ll go and do another things.” The Tanzanians were awarded two penalties with many pundits disputing the referee’s calls but Garba played down the incident, insisting the official’s decisions were final. “I think win or lose, I don’t want to complain about the officiating. This is for the officials; everybody has seen what has happened. For me, the referee has taken his decision, nobody can question the referee’s decision. The referee’s decision is always final,” he added. He is already looking forward to their next match against Angola with a conviction that his players had learnt from the victory over Tanzania. He said: “The Nigerian team that played today, half of the players are entering an aeroplane for the first time.”
