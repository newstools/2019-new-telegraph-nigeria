Lagos State government has rescued a homeless mother of six-month-old twins, who had wandered the street Lagos metropolis for several months. The woman, believed to have mental illness, was sleeping in uncompleted buildings. A heart-breaking video of the woman with six-month-old twins living in a despicable condition had gone viral on the social media. It shows the woman was roaming the streets, particularly LASU-Igando Road with her babies. Apart from the twins, the woman has three other children but nobody could explain why she became homeless. But briefing journalists on the fate of the woman, the state Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Mr. Agoola Dabiri, urged members of the public to shun any antics of the fraudul e n t p e o p l e asking for mone t a r y support for the t w i n s a n d mother w h o w e r e rescued on LASU R o a d , Igando Dabiri said despite the fact that government had taken custody of the woman some fraudsters were still using the video and picture of the woman and her babies to solicit financial assistance. He said: “The mother was a bit unstable mentally while the children were malnourished as at the time they were rescued.” The commissioner said that in addition to the woman and her twins, her three older children were also being taken care of by government. Dabiri, however, implored parents and guardians to be more watchful of their children as cases of defilement was now rampant. He said: “There is no safe place to keep our children; even religious leaders can’t be trusted with them. Let us be more vigilant and report immediately to the Ministry of Youth and Social Development on 09077333425 or 08172457792 any case of defilement or abused around you.”
