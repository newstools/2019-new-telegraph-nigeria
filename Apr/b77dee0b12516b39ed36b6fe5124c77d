A Niger Delta-based non-governmental organisation (NGO), the Centre for Peace and Environmental Justice (CEPEJ) yesterday urged the Federal Government through the Director-General of National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) to particularly visit the creeks in the Niger Delta region that are affected by oil spill to have on-the-spot assessment. The National Coordinator of the organisation, Sheriff Mulade, who made the call during a chat with journalists, however, noted that oil spill-related environmental damage needed urgent attention and thus NOSDRA must be abreast of numerous oil spills in the region in order to discharge appropriately the agency’s statutory obligations to the people. He said: “CEPEJ as a Niger Delta-based nongovernmental organisation with special focus on re-orientation, peace building, environmental best practices and human rights advocacy and the organisation has extended the scope of its advocacy programmes aimed at ensuring pollution-free and environmentallyfriendly oil exploration to every parts of the country. “We see reasons to redirect the attention of NOSDRA to several explosions of oil and gas facilities and pipelines resulting to severe environmental ecological damage, while there are numerous substandard oil and gas transportation facilities that are often prone to leakage, spill and explosion. If NOSDRA makes it a priority to know the location of such facilities they could provide better response operations, which include detection, prevention and result-oriented recentsponse.” Mulade also drew the attention of NOSDRA to the preventable incident of 11 persons, who died in 2016 from a pipeline explosion at Agip Oilfield in Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of Bayelsa State, noting that it was necessary to call on NOSDRA to organise a familiarisation visit to oil spills affected sites particularly in the creeks and to interact with host communities across Niger Delta region. He called on NOSDRA to evaluate the volume of crude and gas that had been discharged into the surrounding environment arising from various explosions, leakages, spills, equipment failure and third party interference. “It is also important to inspect some pipelines that are due for remedial maintenance and proffer solution aimed at forestalling reoccurrence of preventable explosion and spills for the sake of the environment,” he said
