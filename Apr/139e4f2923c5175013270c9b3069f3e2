Former Director General of the defunct National Sports Commission (NSC), Chief Patrick Ekeji, has tipped the Super Eagles to win the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.  Ekeji, said in an interview conducted from his base in Imo State yesterday, that, for the Egypt 2019 AFCON, the Super Eagles of Nigeria is undoubtedly the team to beat. It would be recalled that the Eagles were drawn alongside Burundi, Madagascar and Guinea in Group B of Africa’s biggest football showpiece for national teams.  The former national team defender and chief coach noted that, the reactions of the Super Eagles’ manager, Gernot Rohr, after the draws were conducted, shows that he is not going to take things for granted.  “I know Gernot Rohr will draw his lessons from his past experiences in this same competition and for sure he has a point to prove with respect to AFCON. I wish us best of luck,” Ekeji said.
