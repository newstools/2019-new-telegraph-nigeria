Chris Ugwu writes that the harsh operating environment has continued to weigh down earnings margin of PZ Cussons Nigeria Plc.   Tough macroeconomic conditions has continued to take toll on the earnings of PZ Cussons despite several laudable strategies the management had adopted to reduce the impact of the headwinds on earnings.
The strategies, include downsizing products, price increases, entering into agreements with local suppliers for palm oil supply and further streamlining and optimization of products to improve focus on key brands, consolidation of existing infrastructure and facilities towards improving supply chain efficiencies, among others.
These initiatives have not been able to bring the much needed tonic to increase the profitability of the company due to operational challenges in the country.
PZ Cussons, which had predicted that its full year pre-tax profit is expected to be at the lower end, as conditions in Nigeria have worsened noted while higher oil prices in Nigeria have contributed to increased foreign exchange reserves and a relatively stable exchange rate, liquidity has not flowed down into the economy
In Nigeria, harsh operating system confronting manufacturing sector had led to a low dividend payout of N595 million translating to 15 kobo per share, which board of PZ Cussons plc. approved for shareholders last financial year.
A market sentiment for the shares of PZ Cussons has also dwindled significantly due to challenging environment.
The share price which closed at N22.50 per share in April, 2018 has recorded a dip in growth that when the closing bell rang on Friday, the company’s share price stood at N9.80, a decline of N12.7 or 56.44 per cent year to date. Financials
PZ Cussons recorded 48 per cent decline in profit after tax for the full year ended May 31, 2018.
The group posted a profit after tax of N1.927 billion during the financial year as against N3.686 billion reported in 2017, representing a decline of 48 per cent.
Profit before tax stood at N2.313 billion from N4.811 billion posted in 2017, accounting for a drop of 52 per cent.
However, the group raked in revenue of N80.552 billion during the year under review from N78.215 billion posted in 2017, amounting to a growth of 3 per cent.
Given the relatively weak FY’18 performance, PZ proposed a final dividend of N0.15/share (vs.N0.50 in FY’17).
The company began its financial year unimpressive as it’s first quarter results for the period ended August 2018 slipped into loss. The company’s revenue fell from N18.5 billion in 2017 to N15.8 billion in 2018. The company’s loss before tax worsened from N181 million in 2017 to N204 million in 2018. Loss after tax also stood at N204.634 million as against loss of N123.083 million reported in 2017, accounting for a percentage change of 66.26. Cost of sales was N11.363 billion from N12.550 billion posted in 2017.
However, the company got respite during the second quarter as it posted a PBT growth of 55 per cent to N1.4 billion in H1 ended November 2019.
According to analysts at FBNQuest Capital, the result was supported by a lessened fx impact; fx losses of –N525m were posted versus –N2.6bn in H1 2018.
“Absent fx changes, adjusted PBT for H1 was down 46 per cent y/y. PZ’s H1 earnings were affected by weaknesses across key business lines. According to management, volumes and margins remain under pressure.
“In Q2 (end-Nov), sales of N19.2bn fell by 14 per cent y/y, but PBT and PAT were up 48 per cent y/y and 100 per cent y/y to N1.6bn and N1.4bn respectively. However, a double-digit decline in opex and N143m recorded in FX gains more than offset any negatives coming from the y/y sales decline and a gross margin contraction of -608bps y/y to 22.4 per cent, leading to the PBT growth.
Cosmetics and soap maker recorded a profit after tax of N807,143 million for the nine months ended February 2019 as against N1.337 billion posted in 2018, accounting for a decline 39.65 per cent.
Profit before tax stood at N936.243 million, compared to N1.966 billion in Q3 2018, representing 524 per cent YoY drop.
The company’s total revenue was N55.070 billion, compared to N63.259 billion in Q3 2018, a 12.95 per cent YoY decline.
Cost of sales stood at N42.432 billion in 2019, from 45.023 billion recorded in 2018 while administrative expenses accounted for N3.359 billion during the period under review from N5.574 billion in 2018.
However on q/q analysis, according to InvestmentOne report, similar to the last four trading quarters, PZ’s published Q3 2019 scorecard showed a contraction in its topline performance, reflecting its continued challenges in the nation’s operating environment.
“Consequently, the firm reported a loss before tax of N414million, following the drop in gross profit, higher operating expenses and a rise in net finance cost, which outweighed the impact of a net foreign exchange gain recorded in Q3 2019 against a net foreign exchange loss in Q3 2018.
“In the same vein, on a sequential basis, the highlighted factors combined with a decline in foreign exchange gain as well as a net finance cost in Q3 2019 against a net finance income in Q2 2019 contributed to the loss before tax of N414million in Q3 2019 against a profit before tax of N1.56billion in Q2 2019,” the report said. Profit deflators
Addressing shareholders at the company’s 70th Annual General Meeting ( AGM) in Abuja, its Chairman Chief Kola Jamodu, said the conglomerate experienced drop both in operating profit and profit after tax by 37.7 per cent and 47.7 per cent relatively to previous financial year.
He said the company’s consolidated revenue grew by tree per cent to N80.6 billion up from N78.2 billion during the year under review.
He informed shareholders that cost of borrowing (about 20 per cent) affected the company’s performance, adding it largely affected cost of its goods and also, acerbated by low volume of sales. Analysts’ opinion
According to analysts at InvestmentOne, PZ’s topline performance continued to record negative growth owing to intense competition and fragile consumer spending.
They said: “We suspect the slower growth in the branded good segment as witnessed in recent time (up 6.8 per cent y/y in FY18 vs 19.2 per cent y/y in FY17) coupled with contraction in the white good segment (down 0.5 per cent y/y and 5.9 per cent in FY17 and FY18 respectively) may have continued, thus, responsible for the uninspiring performance in topline in Q3 2019.This, combined with the 766bps y/y decline in gross profit margin to 19.03% due to input cost pressures, led to the significant fall in gross profit by 35.5 per cent y/y to N3.81billion in Q3 2019.
“On a q/q basis, despite the modest uptick in topline by 4.5 per cent, gross profit was down 11.3 per cent q/q largely driven by the 339bps q/q contraction in gross profit margin; a reflection of cost pressures
“Operating expenses rose in Q3 2019 by 42.27 per cent q/q and 3.68 per cent y/y to N4.21billion. On a y/y basis, the increase in operating expenses was solely due to the 23.60 per cent y/y rise in selling and distribution expenses, which offset the 23.31 per cent y/y decline in administrative cost. The rise in selling and distribution expenses may have been driven by the need to grow volume amidst competition as the parent company in its half year presentation highlighted that it would review its product portfolio”.
They noted that as a result, the higher operating expenses coupled with the massive decline in gross profit witnessed in the quarter led to an operating loss of N399 million in Q3 2019; the first ever in recent time.
“Net finance cost rose by 20.3% y/y in Q3 2019 despite the 78.9% y/y reduction in interest expense to N113million. The increase in net finance cost was due to the 92.7% y/y drop in interest income to N34million, which may have been driven by the 69.5% contraction in cash and cash equivalent. Again, similar to last quarter, PZ recorded a foreign exchange gain of N33million in its Q3 2019 financial performance against a loss of N705million in Q3 2018. This may have been supported by the relative stability in the FX market largely on the back of CBN’s sustained intervention in that space,” they said. Future outlook
The soap maker said recently that it expected a sharp decline in pretax profit for the year ending May 2019, hurt by sluggish demand and challenging conditions in its important Nigerian market.
According to reports, the company said full-year adjusted pretax profit is now expected to be 70 million pounds ($92.1 million), down from 80.1 million pounds a year earlier. PZ Cussons also said adjusted pretax profit for the half year declined 1.5 per cent to 32.8 million.
However, Jamodu assured the shareholders that, measures had been taken to guarantee a more sterling performance in next financial year.
“These include further streamlining and optimization of products to improve focus on key brands, consolidation of existing infrastructure and facilities towards improving supply chain efficiencies, optimization of operating model to reduce overheads and speed to market for new products “, said Chairman. Last line
It is vital for the company to continue to manage its cost base tightly to begin to deliver moderate operating margins for growth and profitability despite crisis in the economy.
