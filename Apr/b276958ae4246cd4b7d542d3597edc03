Police yesterday announced the killing of nine suspected kidnappers operating on the everbusy Abuja-Kaduna Highway. The suspects, according to a statement by the Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO), DCP Frank Mba, were killed in a fierce gun battle with special forces attached to the recently-launched Operation Puff Adder. Mba, however, disclosed that one of the operatives, who sustained injury during the encounter, was receiving medical attention. He said: “The unrelenting efforts to root-out criminal elements terrorising commuters on Abuja-Kaduna Expressway recorded additional successes on 10th April, 2019, with the recovery of six AK47 rifles, one Pump Action Gun, 1,206 rounds of AK47 ammunition, seven magazines, 28 cartridges and 158 expended shells by police operatives attached to Operation Puff Adder deployed in the area. “The recovery followed a serious exchange of gun fire encounter between the police operatives and a heavily armed notorious criminal gang at the Akilbu Forest, off Abuja-Kaduna Expressway, which resulted in the death of nine members of the gang while two escaped with gunshot wounds. “One of the police operatives, however, sustained gunshot wound and he is presently receiving treatment in a hospital. Effort is being intensified to arrest the fleeing members of the gang.” The FPRO also said that the Acting Inspector General Police (IG), Mohammed Adamu, had expressed satisfaction with the successes recorded so far in the fight against kidnapping and other heinous crimes across the country. The IG, Mba said, “reiterates his call for support by the public to the police and other sister agencies, as he gives the assurance that the war against bandits will soon be won.”
