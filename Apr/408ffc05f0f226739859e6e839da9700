Residents of Aba, the commercial hub of Abia State have urged Governor Okezie Ikpeazu to lift ban on tricycle operations in the area as banning their operations in the night had made life difficult for residents.  According to them, banning the tricycle (Keke) operations by the state government, restricting their operation in the night had made life extremely difficult for Aba residents.  The state government in a release two weeks ago said it had placed temporary ban in the tricycle’s operations in Umuahia and Aba between 9:00p.m. and 7:00a.m. with a view to curbing rising crime rate in the two cities.  New Telegraph gathered that prices of transport fare had skyrocketed since the past two weeks varying between morning and evening as bus drivers always hiked prices immediately it was past 7p.m. every evening.  Some residents, who spoke to New Telegraph yesterday, said that they had accepted whatever would be done to secure Abia, but querying the rationale behind the ban as the state did not provide alternative which would make night movement from various parts of the city after work easier.  “They just gave bus drivers opportunity to extort people mercilessly. Places Keke will take you for N50 naira is now N150, while places that were N100 are now N200 or N250. “I don’t blame them because the buses are few and people are usually rushing to go home every night.  The worst of it all is that these buses don’t even take you to your street not to talk of your home. “They drop you off the major road linking your destination and you’ll have to trek home a longer distance before you get home. The suffering is too much. I want the government to look into it,” they said.
