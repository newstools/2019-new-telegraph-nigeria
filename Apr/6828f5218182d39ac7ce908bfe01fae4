Super Eagles goalkeeper, Francis Uzoho’s, red card on Monday, while playing for his Cypriot club Anorthosis Famagusta, has raised another talking point about issues of racism, following critical comments from observers that it was a case of double tragedy for the Nigerian shot-stopper. With floods of sympathy now flowing his way, considering that his first ever red card was occasioned by repeated racist chants hurled at him during a league game, Uzoho’s case has opened another chapter in global football’s escalating battle against discrimination of colour. Uzoho, 20, becomes the latest Nigerian to come under the scourge of racists in Europe, just a year after Leon Balogun and Anthony Ujah faced a similar scenario in Germany. The latest incident occurred on Monday, and a football analyst in Cyprus Panikos Theodosiou disclosed that Uzoho got angry due to racist chants hurled at him by opposing fans during a league match, but he allowed his temper get the better of him and ended up with a red card. Theodosiou, an ace broadcaster, also disclosed that Uzoho lost his cool due to repeated chants from the fans of Alki Oroklinis, and unwittingly showed them his middle fingers, only to draw the referee’s wrath. Consequently, Uzoho, who is on loan at Anorthosis from Deportivo La Coruna of Spain, following his falling out with second division rivals, Elche, got the first red card of his career in the 23rd minute of their 3-0 home win over Oroklinis, shortly after his side scored their second goal.
