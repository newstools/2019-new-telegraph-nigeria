The management of Shooting Stars Sports Club of Ibadan has charged the team to go all out for total victory in their Nigeria National League encounter against Giant Briller of Enugu in Matchday Two of the league.
The chairman of the club, Gbolagade Busari, wants the players to approach Saturday’s match with the mindset to win, bearing in mind the reaction of the fans after the draw against Abia Comets in their opening game of the season.
3SC will lock horns with the newly promoted Enugu-based team this Saturday in a NNL Group B1 MatchDay Two encounter.
Having been held to a 1-1 draw by Abia Comets in the season’s opener last Wednesday, the Oluyole Warriors are condemned to get a victory in Enugu to keep alive their hopes of emerging tops of the group. Some fans of the Oluyole Warriors reacted angrily to the 1-1 draw secured against Comets, a development which the chairman said should serve as a tonic for them as they prepare to take to the pitch this weekend. “The players saw the reaction of the fans after our match against Abia Comets,” Busari said. “They were not happy with the outcome of that match and we have no excuse, we let them down. “Now the players have a chance to prove to them that they are equal to the task. A win this weekend is the only avenue to win back the heart of the fans and that is what the players must go for “On the part of the management, we have done our part in encouraging the players, thanks to the commitment of the state government and we expect them to reciprocate by posting good results, not only in our game against Giant Briller, but in the remaining fixtures.”
