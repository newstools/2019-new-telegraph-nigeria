If the recent event in Liberia is anything to go by, it seems animals are gradually taking over the presidential villa by sacking presidents from their offices.  Last week, it was reported that snakes were found in the office of the Liberian president, George Weah. The reptiles found in the Monrovia mansion forced the ex-footballer to abandon his office and work from his private residence.  According to Weah’s Press Secretary, Smith Toby, two black snakes were found in the president’s office at the Foreign Affairs Ministry building on Wednesday. Following the incident, all staff were consequently asked to stay away from work until the building would have been fumigated.  The story in Liberia is a reminder of how rodents ravaged President Muhammadu Buhari’s office in Aso Rock in August 2017.  The Senior Special Assistant to the President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Mr. Shehu Garba, had in August 22, 2017 said that the president’s office was ravaged by rodents during the his medical trip which lasted over a hundred days in the United Kingdom.
