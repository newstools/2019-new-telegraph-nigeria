All Progressives Congress (APC) women aspirants in various elective positions in the last general election yesterday claimed that they were intimidated and bullied out of the race by the party’s leaders during the primaries preceding the general election. The women, under the auspices of APC Women Aspirants Forum in Abuja, said despite their grass roots base in the various states, the party unwittingly despised them in deference to their male counterparts. Speaking on behalf of the group, Mrs. Adedoyin Eshanumi, who said she was senatorial aspirant in Kogi State, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene in their case and compensate the women with 35 per cent cabinet and 50 per cent membership in board appointments. Eshanumi, who was also the chairperson of the forum, called on the ruling party to shun undemocratic practices capable of decreasing the number of women in both elective and appointive positions against global best practices. She said the women aspirants, despite the unfair treatment meted out to them, still believed in the party and President Muhammadu Buhari. According to her, women were the major stakeholders that worked for Buhari’s victory at the polls. “As we celebrate Your Excellency on our victory at the polls, please remember the APC women aspirants who were bullied out and intimidated during the primary elections, despite our grass roots base and solid structures and popularity, thereby decreasing the number of women at the various elective positions and creating a huge gender imbalance in government.
