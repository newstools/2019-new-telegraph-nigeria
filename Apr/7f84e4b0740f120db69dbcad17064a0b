Whether you prefer white or red wine is generally a matter of taste. But if you want the healthiest pick, which would be your choice? Red wine has drawn lots of attention for its research-backed potential to lower the risk of heart disease and lengthen your lifespan. Does white wine have the same benefits? The main difference between white and red wine has to do with the colour of the grapes used. It also has to do with whether the grape juice is fermented with or without the grape skin. To make white wine, grapes are pressed and skins, seeds and stems are removed before fermentation.  However, to make red wine, the crushed red grapes are transferred to vats directly and they ferment with the skin, seeds and stems. The grape skins lend the wine its pigment, as well as many of the distinctive health compounds found in red wine. As a result of steeping with the grape skins, red wine is particularly rich in plant compounds that are present in those skins, such as tannins and resveratrol. White wine also has some of these healthy plant compounds, but generally in much lower amounts. Overall, red wine has a slight edge over white because it has higher amounts of some vitamins and minerals. Nevertheless, white wine contains fewer calories.
