For widows numbering over a hundred and the youths of Arochukwu Local Government Area of Abia State, there wouldn’t be a better way to celebrate Easter than what they experienced through the benevolence of the Chairman of Etoks Communications, Deacon Iyke Kanu.
The ancient city came alive on Saturday, 21 April, 2019 with widows’ empowerment preceded by the third place final match of Iyke Kanu Unity Cup.  Etokebe as he is fondly called by friends and admirers alike is no green horn in philanthropic dispositions but this time, he upped the ante with lavish gifts and endless entertainment for the widows in Arochukwu Local Government, prompting the entire city to erupt in endless frenzy of his name and kindheartedness, even as the youth wing chant songs of praise for Etokebe to high heavens, while jubilation all over the city.  Beyond the generous cash gifts to the widows, they also went home with a bag of rice each, clothing materials, other food items and some of their children placed on scholarship.  However, the two days affair continued on Easter Sunday with the Final of Iyke Kanu Unity Cup. Arochukwu Ward 3 defeated Ward 4 by three goals to win the golden cup and cash prize money of Five Hundred Thousand Naira while Arochukwu Wards 4 and 2 who came second and third went home with the silver, the sum of Three Hundred Thousand Naira and bronze with the sum of Two Hundred Thousand Naira respectively.
