Scientists in the United Kingdom (UK) said urine sample could be used to screen for cervical cancer in women. This development came when a new study trial found that urine testing was as good at detecting a virus called HPV, which is a big risk factor for cervical cancer. The study is published in the BMJ Open reports. When using urine test to screen for cervical cancer becomes operational, millions of women who evade cervical cancer screening through the smear test could now prevent the cancer and unnecessary deaths that are often associated with its development. Women who were too anxious or embarrassed to go for a smear test could instead provide a urine sample to be screened for cervical cancer, the ‘BBC’ reported. A smear test also called the Papanicolaou test is carried out on a sample of cells from the cervix to check for abnormalities that may be indicative of cervical cancer. It is a method of cervical screening used to detect potentially precancerous and cancerous processes in the cervix. Abnormal findings are often followed up by more sensitive diagnostic procedures and if warranted, interventions that aim to prevent progression to cervical cancer. The new findings which show that urine test can detect cervical cancer, will encourage more women to screen. For instance, it has been shown that the number of people going for smear tests is lower than ever not only in the United Kingdom (UK), but also in other parts of the world, especially in the African continent. The researchers stated that bigger trials were still needed before this urine test approach could become a reality. However, experts said self-testing could be a gamechanger for women.
