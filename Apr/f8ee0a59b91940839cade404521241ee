Media personality, Moet Abebe has made it clear she is not anyone’s role model. According to the radio and TV host, parents are responsible for how their kids turn out, not celebrities.  Abebe recently had many trolls on her case when she shared a spicy photo of herself on social media. Many were quick to remind her that she is a role model to the girl-child and should watch what she puts out there. Obviously broken by the statement, Abebe made it a duty to remind parents that she is just living her life and is not a role model their kids must emulate.  She made her stance known in a post on her social media account. According to her, “This whole role model thing has always irked the heck out of me! I’m living my life for me o! Not for your kids to emulate and look up to. If your child is looking outside for a suitable role model then that says a lot about you as a parent. I’m not responsible for how your child turns out…you are!” she responded to critics. Moet went on to address those calling her all sorts of irredeemable names of her achievement as one of the best radio personalities in the county. In her words, “Now let me just put this out there for those of you who forgot or need a quick reminder. YES! Moet Abebe is one of the most sought after female On Air Personalities (if you want to act like you don’t know this) with a number of awards to support it. Don’t get it twisted… from 2-6 pm every day, I take over the airwaves like I was born to do it; so please don’t try to discredit the work I have put in since I moved back to this country. Call me names, make fun of my accent; call me ‘Ashewo’ but remember I worked super hard and nothing got handed over to me not even the title ‘Radio goddess’. I had to work and prove to myself that this radio thing can be achieved if I put my mind to it and that I have done so effortlessly”, she boasted.
