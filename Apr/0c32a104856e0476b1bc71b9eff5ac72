 Nigeria’s Golden Eaglets will begin their quest for their third CAF U-17 African Cup of Nations title as they take on hosts Tanzania in the opening match of the 2019 edition of the competition.
The Coach Manu Garba’s side are also looking to be one of the four countries that will qualify for the World Cup slated to take place in Brazil later in the year.
Eaglets’ build up to the tournament has not been fantastic after some key members of the team failed the mandatory MRI test.
They won WAFU B U-17 Tournament in Niger Republic in September last year, and will be aiming to extend their dominance on the continent. They won the African tourney on two occasions in Seychelles 2001 and Togo 2007.
“Our first aim is to qualify for the World Cup and win the competition,” Garba told reporters .
“It’s not going to be an easy task because the other seven countries have the same objective too, but we are going to give our best to ensure we come out tops at the end of the competition.”
Uganda and Angol will clash in other Group A matches.
Tanzania made their way into the draw automatically as hosts, while Uganda won the Central East zonal finals held in Tanzania in August last year, and Angola triumphed at the COSAFA U-17 Tournament in Mauritius a month earlier.
Cameroon, Guinea, Senegal and Morocco make up Group B. Both Cameroon and Guinea are appearing for the 7th time at the U17 AFCON, while Morocco and Senegal are both appearing for the second time.
