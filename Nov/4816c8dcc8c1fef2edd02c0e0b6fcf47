Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the February 23, 2019 election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar has enjoined the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure free and fair polls on Saturday in Kogi and Bayelsa states. Atiku, in a statement by his media office, advised electorate in the two states to vote wisely by electing capable hands to steer the affairs of their states. He told voters to take serious interest in the choices they make as they cast their votes, and urged PDP members to use the power of their overwhelming strength in those two states in ensuring that its flag remains standing in the Bayelsa State Government House. According to him, the people of Kogi State should “begin to have a feel of better life under a PDP administration.” He reminded the voters that the senatorial election in Kogi West is equally crucial, and said they should turn out in their numbers to defend the seat. The former vice president told the people that the leadership of the PDP has abiding confidence in the voters in Kogi West senatorial election, adding that “the choices before them are between a continuation of quality representation at the Senate and a promise of meaningless change.” Atiku also called on all political actors to exhibit necessary decorum and sportsmanship. “Election is about the people and not a war against the people,” he further advised, and urged security agencies on election duty to do their jobs with utmost professionalism. He asked all parties in the elections to bear in mind that democracy can flourish only when everyone plays according to its rules.
