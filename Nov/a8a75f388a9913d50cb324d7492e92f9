T he Nigerian Police Force yesterday arraigned 60 members of the proscribed Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), otherwise known as Shi’ites, before an Abuja High Court sitting in Apo over alleged disturbance of public peace. Their arraignment is coming five months after their arrest in the Abuja metropolis.  They were arraigned on a nine-count charge bordering on homicide, disturbance of public peace and destruction of government properties. The defendants were among those arrested during the July 22, 2019 protest at the Central Business District (CBD) area of the FCT.  The protest led to the death of DCP Usman Umar and a youth corps member, Precious Owolabi, attached to Channels Television. The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to all the counts.  The charge, with number: CR/31/19 bordered on homicide, disturbances of public peace and destruction of government properties.  After their non-guilty plea, the prosecution counsel, Simon Lough, urged the court to remand the defendants in Correctional Centre in Kuje, Abuja, having being held in custody of the SARS in the past five months. He also urged the court to move its sitting to Kuje due to logistics.  The defence counsel, Bala Dakum, did not oppose the prosecution’s request, but told the court that he intends to move a bail application.  The trial judge, Justice Suleima Belgore ordered the remand of the defendants in SARS custody till December 10, pending the hearing of the bail application and venue of trial.
