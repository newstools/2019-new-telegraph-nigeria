Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio repeatedly molested Mark Matzek, now 56, when he was an altar boy at St. Nicholas Church and a student at St. Nicholas School in Jersey City back in the mid-1970s, the victim’s lawyer told the Associated Press. The Catholic bishop, who heads the Diocese of Brooklyn and was named by the pope to investigate allegations of clergy sex abuse in upstate New York, has now been accused of the same crimes. Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio repeatedly molested Mark Matzek when he was an altar boy at St. Nicholas Church and a student at St. Nicholas School in Jersey City back in the mid-1970s, the victim’s lawyer told the Associated Press. At the time, DiMarzio was a parish priest in New Jersey — and a second priest, the late Rev. Albert Mark, also allegedly participated in the abuse, Matzek said. Matzek and his lawyer are preparing a lawsuit against the church over the alleged abuse, reports the New York Post. DiMarzio said there is no truth to the claims. “In my nearly 50-year ministry as a priest, I have never engaged in unlawful or inappropriate behavior and I emphatically deny this allegation. I am confident I will be fully vindicated,” DiMarzio said in a statement. Last month, Pope Francis put DiMarzio in charge of investigating a sex abuse scandal within the church’s Buffalo Diocese. There, Bishop Joseph Malone has come under fire for allegedly bungling the investigation.
