Antique jewellery believed to be worth more than a billion euros has been stolen in a raid on a German museum. Detectives said the Green Vault in Dresden was targeted by thieves in the early hours of Monday morning, reports metro.co.uk. According to ‘Bild’, the amount stolen may have been worth around £850 million – up to a billion euros. It reports that thieves switched off an electricity supply to the museum at 5am before breaking in through a window. The thieves allegedly targeted jewellery, diamonds and precious stones worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Police spokesman Thomas Geithner confirmed the break-in and said: “The crime scene group is on the scene, the perpetrators are on the run.” The ‘Green Vault’ holds the largest collection of treasures in Europe and was founded by Prince Elector Frederick Augustus I, later nicknamed Augustus the Strong, in 1723. It is housed in Dresden Castle and makes up part of the Dresden State Art Collections.
