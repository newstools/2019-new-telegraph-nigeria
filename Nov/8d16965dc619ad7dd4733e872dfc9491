Former Nigeria’s U-20 coach, Ladan Bosso, has urged the Super Eagles Manager, Gernot Rohr, to prosecute the remaining matches of the 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifiers with more home-based players. He said the Eagles had started the campaign on a good note and could still win the ticket to next AFCON if the coach relies on home based stars. “You have heard it severally, from some of the coaches that home based players  lack tactics but if you have more time to work with them they can give you what you want,” he told our correspondent. “Now we have a long time before the next match in AFCON qualifiers; If I was in charge, I would try to have a camping programme for about six to eight weeks with the home lads; because in the next match whether we win or lose we still have a chance to qualify, so why not concentrate on the home lads? “Establish a scouting system to get the best of the home boys, train them and let them go for such a match at least, if you can’t go with all, 80% of the people that should play should be home based star.” He believes there are some talents who can help Nigeria to victory without hassle as he pointed that there was still enough time to scout for and train the home based stars. Bosso stated that some of the successful players currently in the team were given the opportunity, insisting that the home based players should be given a try.
