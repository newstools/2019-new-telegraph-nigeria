 B enue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, yesterday said that the implementation of the National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP) in the state would conform strictly to the state’s Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law, 2017. He spoke at the launch of the national livestock transformation plan and the commencement of training on the programme, which was held in Makurdi, the state capital. The governor said the plan would be implemented according to peculiarities of Benue State, stressing that the focus would be on livestock including pigs, goats, poultry, sheep and cows. He explained further that Benue decided to domesticate the NLTP when stakeholders were convinced that the state would be free to own and implement the programme. Governor Ortom encouraged Benue households to venture into animal husbandry in addition to crop farming with ranching as the driving force. He reaffirmed the commitment of his administration to the full implementation of the state’s Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law, saying that no part of the state would be allocated for grazing reserves or Ruga settlements. The governor commended the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Agriculture in the office of the Vice-President, Dr. Andrew Kwasari, for his contributions to the NLTP initiative, assuring him of greater collaboration. He appealed to the Federal Government to fulfil its promise of ensuring the return of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) to their ancestral homes.
