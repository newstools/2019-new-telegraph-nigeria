Retired Armed Forces pensioners will soon heave a sigh of relief, as the Military Pensions Board (MPB) has pledged to deliver improved service to retirees across the country. It said military retirees, by their nature and the peculiar circumstances in which they served their fatherland deserved more attention and tender handling. Specifically, the MPB said the capacity building workshop, was designed to upgrading its workforce, with a view to the meeting global best practices in pension administration. The MPB is an entity under the Defence Headquarters, saddled with the dual mandate of payment of gratuity and pensions to retired members of the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) as well as payment of death benefits to Next-of-Kins (NOKs) of deceased military personnel. Chairman of the Military Pensions Board, Maj-Gen. Ahmadu  Adamu, gave the undertaking yesterday in Abuja, at the closing ceremony of a five-day training workshop for 27 supervisors. The capacity building workshop for supervisors drawn from the Nigerian Army, Nigerian Navy, as well as Nigerian Air Force, was done in collaboration with the Administrative Staff College of Nigeria (ASCON). According to the MPB’s chairman, the choice of ASCON was deliberate, considering its position as the premier government training institution in the country.
