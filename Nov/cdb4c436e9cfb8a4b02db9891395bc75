A Nigerian, Kayode Philip, alias ‘Voice of the King’, and his Lebanese accomplice, Hamza Koudeih, on Monday appeared before Justice Sule Hassan of a Federal High Court in Lagos over alleged laundering of the sums of $7.06 million and €80,000.
The duo were brought to court by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and are facing a 24-count charge bordering on the alleged offence.
Efforts by the anti-graft agency to arraign Philip and Koudeih before Justice Hassan on Monday were, however, stalled owing to the insistence by the latter’s lawyer, Abdulamid Mohammed, to see the charge sheet against his client.
Mohammed informed the judge that he was based in Abuja and had to rush down to Lagos after he learnt on Sunday that the matter will be coming up on Monday.
He said on getting to court Monday morning, his client told him that the EFCC only served the charge sheet on him last week Friday and he gave it to his wife who took it home.
Citing Section 36 of the Constitution, which provided that an accused must be given adequate time and facility to prepare for his defence, the lawyer urged Justice Hassan to adjourn the case to enable him study the charge sheet and prepare for his client’s defence.
EFCC’s lawyer, Rotimi Oyedepo, was, however, opposed to the request on the ground that it was a ploy to delay the arraignment of the accused persons.
