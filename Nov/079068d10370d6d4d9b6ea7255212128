England have been drawn against Croatia and Czech Republic in Group D at UEFA EURO 2020, with Wales alongside Italy, Switzerland and Turkey in Group A. Germany will face world champions France and reigning European champions Portugal in Group F. The winners of Scotland’s play-off path, which includes Norway, Serbia and Israel, will join England’s group. Gareth Southgate’s World Cup semi-finalists begin their campaign against Croatia at Wembley on June 14. The tournament’s opening game will see Italy host Turkey in Rome on June 12. Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland all feature in the play-offs next March, where 16 teams will compete to fill the final four places. England, joint bookmakers’ favourites along with France to win the tournament, will benefit from hosting all three of their group games at Wembley. Southgate’s side already knew they would be placed in Group D, with the qualified countries of the 12 host cities purposefully placed in specific groups to ensure at least two home games. England’s tournament begins on Sunday, June 14 when they host Croatia at Wembley in a repeat of the 2018 World Cup semi-final which was won by Zlatko Dalic’s side. Southgate’s side follow that up against the winner of play-off path C on June 19 and complete their group stage against Czech Republic on June 23. If England win their group, their last-16 tie would be in Dublin against the runner-ups in a hugely competitive looking Group F – which already includes Germany, France and Portugal – with a potential quarter-final in Rome. Should they finish second, it would be a trip to Copenhagen against the runner-ups from Group E, which features Spain, before a quarter-final in St Petersburg. There are other possibilities if they are one of the best third-place finishers.
