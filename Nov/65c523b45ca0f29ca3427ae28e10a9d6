Positive FIRS tax collections rose from N3.3trn in 2016 to N5.32trn in 2018  T en deposit money banks in the country paid a total of N134.15 billion as income tax for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2019, latest results released by the lenders show.   This is N23.49 billion (21.2 per cent) over the N110.66 billion the lenders paid in the same period of 2018.  The banks are Zenith Bank, Guaranty Trust Bank(GTBank), United Bank for Africa (UBA), Access Bank, FBN Holdings, Stanbic IBTC, Fidelity Bank, Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (ETI), Sterling Bank and Wema Bank.   Under Nigerian law, Companies Income Tax (CIT) is tax on the profits of incorporated entities in the country.  It also includes tax on the profits of non-resident companies operating in the country.  The tax is paid by limited liability companies inclusive of the public limited liability companies. It is, therefore, commonly referred to as corporate tax and it is one of the taxes administered and collected by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS).   New Telegraph’s analysis of the lenders’ nine-month 2019 results indicates that ETI paid the most tax of N32.05 billion from a pre-tax profit of N109.49 billion.   This was 54.05 per cent above the N20.81 billion the lender paid as tax in the corresponding period of 2018.  It was followed by Zenith Bank, which paid N25.46 billion as tax from a pre-tax profit of N176.18 billion. The N25.46 billion is 10.08 per cent more than the N23.13 billion the bank paid as tax in the same period of last year.   GTBank paid N23.66 billion as tax from a pre-tax profit of N170.65 billion, which was 7.45 per cent above the N22.02 billion the lender paid as tax in the nine-month 2018 period.  UBA, which reported a pre-tax profit of N98.23 billion for the period under review, paid N16.61 billion as tax compared with N17.41 billion it paid in the corresponding period of last year.   Tier 2 lender, Stanbic IBTC, paid N13.56 billion as tax from a pre-tax profit of N69.11 billion. This was 27.61 per cent more than the N10.62billion it paid in the 9month 2018 period.  Access Bank paid N12.36 billion as tax from a pre-tax profit of N103.10 billion. The results show that the lender paid 68.06 per cent more tax than the N7.36 billion it paid in the same period of 2018. From a pre-tax profit of N60.03 billion, FBN Holdings paid tax of N8.19 billion as against the N6.39 billion it paid in the corresponding period of last year.  Fidelity Bank paid N1.54 billion as income tax from a pre-tax profit of N23 billion. The amount was 30.13 per cent below the N2.21 billion the lender paid in the same of 2018.   From the N410 million, which it paid as tax in the nine-month 2018 period, Wema Bank paid N640 million as tax from a pre-tax profit of N4.73 billion for the same period of this year.  Sterling Bank paid tax of N72 million from a pre-tax profit of N7.65 billion. This amount was 75.76 per cent above the N270 million the lender paid in the corresponding period of 2018. Analysts believe that the uptrend in taxes paid by DMBs in the last few quarters is positive for the Federal Government’s efforts to boost revenue generation. It would be recalled that as part of efforts to ensure that the fate of the nation’s economy is no longer primarily determined by developments in the international oil market, the Government, through the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), has introduced several initiatives in the last few years aimed at improving tax revenue collection.   For instance, speaking at the flag-off of the new Tax Identification Number (TIN) registration system and consolidated National Taxpayers’ Database for North Central zone in Ilorin last month, FIRS Chairman, Mr. Babatunde Fowler, disclosed that about 45 million Nigerians will be captured as taxpayers before December 2019.  He stated that internally generated revenue collection at the sub-national level grew exponentially by 46.11 per cent from N800.02 billion in 2016 to N1.16 trillion in 2018, adding that FIRS tax collections grew by 53.9 per cent from N3.3 trillion in 2016 to N5.32 trillion.   However, despite government’s efforts, official data still shows that Nigeria has one of the world’s lowest ratios of tax to Gross Domestic Product (GDP). That is the total amount of tax collected as a proportion of GDP – the value of the country’s goods and services.  In 2016, for instance, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) put Nigeria’s tax to GDP ratio at 6 per cent.   The tax-to-GDP ratio in South Africa was 29%, Ghana 18 per cent, Egypt 15 per cent and Kenya 18 per cent, the OECD said.  The average for OECD members – which includes all the advanced economies – was 34 per cent. Analysts attribute Nigeria’s low tax to GDP ratio to factors such as, lack of expansion of the tax net, partial enforcement of tax laws, bureaucratic tax procedures and lack of transparency and accountability on the part of the country’s tax authorities.
