Former Governor of Zamfara State,  Alhaji Abdul’aziz Yari, has petitioned his successor in office and current Governor of the state, Alhaji  Bello Mattawalle,  over the non-payment of his monthly upkeep allowance and pension benefits for four months. In a letter dated October 17, 2019, Yari drew the attention of Mattawalle to the Grants of Pensions and Other Allowances Law for former Governors, Deputy Governors, former Speakers and Deputy Speakers in the state. The law provides among other entitlements of a former governor, a monthly upkeep allowance of  N10,000,000 and a pension equivalent to the salary he was receiving while in office. Yari lamented that since he stepped down as governor after his eight-year tenure, the allowances and pension due him have been irregular. “According, you may wish to be informed that since the expiration of my tenure on May 29, 2019, I was only paid the upkeep allowance twice. That is the months of June and July  while my pension for the month of June has not been paid. “As the law provides, the pension and upkeep allowance  are not in the category of privileges  that can be truncated without any justifiable reason. Hence, the  need to request you to kindly direct  the settlement of the total backlog  of  the pension  and the upkeep allowance as provided by the law, ” he wrote. Yari expressed the hope that his successor would expedite action on the mail to enable him get these entitlements as quickly as possible. The phenomenon of sitting state governors getting the state legislature to approve huge pension benefits, monthly upkeep allowance and sundry privileges has been roundly criticised by Nigerians. Many civil society organisations have described the practice as robbery of the public treasury and demanded the scrapping of such laws in states where they exist.
