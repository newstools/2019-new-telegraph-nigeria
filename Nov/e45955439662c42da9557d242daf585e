Y IAGA AFRICA, an election monitoring nongovernmental group, said the conduct of last Saturday’s governorship election in Kogi State fell below standard.  The group, which said its report was based on two months of reports from its citizen observers, said it exposes serious shortcomings in the pre-election period, the election day environment and, to a lesser extent, in the conduct of the polls themselves. It said, in a statement, that the elections, which took place after the 2019 general election, did not meet the expectations of many Nigerians, describing them as “missed opportunity to enhance public confidence in the country’s electoral institutions. “These issues seriously compromise the credibility of the Kogi gubernatorial and senatorial polls.”  The group disclosed that it deployed a total of 548 observers for the Kogi elections with 500 polling unit observers deployed to 250 sampled polling units. According to the group, last Saturday’s elections were significant especially in the conduct and processes of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), but noted some drawbacks in election logistics management, quality of election personnel, integrity and transparency of the results collation.  It added that political parties failed to contest the elections according to democratic rules, but “instead vied for elected office based on buying votes rather than speaking to issues, manipulating the courts for political advantage, and compromising the political environment to prevent political competition  “The challenges in Kogi 2019 governorship elections squally lies on the role and failures of security agencies, the police in particular, political parties, the major candidates and their state and non-state accomplices.
