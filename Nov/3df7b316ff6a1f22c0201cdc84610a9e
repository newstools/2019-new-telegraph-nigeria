 C ontrary to earlier statement credited the Director, African Department of International Monetary Fund (IMF) Abebe Selassie, who had said that the continuous closure of the Nigerian borders was hurting economies of Benin and Niger Republics, the Fund has said that Benin economy is strong.  It said the Francophone West African neighbour of Nigeria, has continued to post a strong economic performance despite the closure of the border the country shares with Nigeria. A Deputy Division Chief in the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department, Luc Eyraud, who led the Funds’s team during their recent visit to Benin was quoted by the Fund in a press release saying, “Real GDP is expected to grow by 6.4 per cent in 2019, mostly driven by the agriculture and transport sectors. Growth should accelerate in 2020 and remain sustained over the medium term, buttressed by vigorous cotton production, construction, and port activities.  “Consumer price inflation, affected by the high agriculture production, has been on a declining trend, falling by 1.4 per cent in the first nine months of 2019, relative to the same period one year earlier. “It is expected to remain well below the 3.0 per cent regional ceiling in 2019 and 2020. The fiscal deficit for 2019 is estimated at 2.3 per cent of the recently rebased GDP.  “Performance under the IMF-supported programme has been very satisfactory so far this year. All end-June 2019 quantitative performance criteria and the end-September structural benchmark program were met.”  Selassie had spoken about the adverse effects the border closure had on the neighbouring countries like Benin republic, urging the countries to come together and discuss in order to resolve the challenges caused by illegal trade and smuggling.  While Selassie understood the impact of the illegal trade, he hoped that there would be an amicable resolution in which both Benin republic and Nigeria (which he referred to as Benin’s big brother) would benefit from.
