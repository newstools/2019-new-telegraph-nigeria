South African rapper, AKA, wants Burna Boy to apologise to him before he visits South Africa for his forthcoming grand performance. This is another indication that the lingering rift between the duo is yet to wane. The South African rapper took to his Twitter page on Wednesday, where he posted a series of tweets. He demanded that Burna Boy apologises for the statement he made a few months ago during the xenophobic attacks in South Africa. “Ek se …@burnaboy all we want is an apology. We know is not perfect. But we took you in as our own before you reached these levels. You say you are an AFRICAN GIANT, prove it. Leadership. I am willing to swallow my pride and put an end to this division. @burnaboy Are you?” he tweeted. It didn’t end there as AKA went on to respond to a tweet from a follower who tweeted about Burna Boy attacking AKA. “He’s so petty! @burnaboy go still knack am something!”, the follower tweeted. Then AKA replied with a tweet that should give Burna Boy a reason to re-evaluate his trip to South Africa. “This is not a joke. Mina, I still want to go perform in Lagos and make it back safely to my family. Don’t you want the same for him?” he tweeted.
