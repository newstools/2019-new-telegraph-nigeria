The Chairman, Core Media Group and Lead Visioner of Jandor Foundation and , Mr. Olajide Adediran has reiterated his Foundation’s continued and unwavering philanthropic gestures to the less privileged. Speaking during the Surulere Empowerment Programme for trade unions and groups by his foundation at the Eagle Club, Surulere, Lagos, Adeniran said the philanthropic gesture is to empower the less privileged and alleviate poverty in the society. He said nothing less is expected of a man who had threaded the path and has had first-hand experience of poverty while growing up before God’s unquestionable transformation manifested. Narrating his story, he said: “It is a must for me to do more good works for the needy. Adediran, that people see today as being blessed with surplus was once faced with a situation of having to solicit help to pay his school fees as an undergraduate, but with the help of one God’s sent, it has become history today. “Does someone like me now have any excuse whatsoever, not to offer help to the needy where I can?” The Jandor Foundation boss, who is not ashamed of his humble beginning, therefore appreciated God for enabling him and his Foundation to fill in the gap for the less privileged. Like other places in Lagos State touched by Jandor Foundation since the inception of these good work, Surulere is not an exception at all, as trade unions and groups got support reliefs. Among artisans and trade unions that benefited from the recent Jandor Foundation empowerment were vulcanizers, barbers, hair dressers and fashion designers among others.
