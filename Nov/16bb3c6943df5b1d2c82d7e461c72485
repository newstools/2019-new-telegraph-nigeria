H ead coach of Rangers International F.C, Benedict Ugwu, has assured the club’s numerous fans that the team had enough in their ‘Arsenal’ to earn a good result in Gombe as the ‘Flying Antelopes’ begin its quest for an 8th league diadem. The former defence lynchpin said that the number of quality legs recruited by the club at the start of the season gives him the confidence that his wards can go the whole hug and be counted among the front runners. “I strongly believe that with the calibre of players we have, we would challenge effectively for all the competitions we are taking part in,” he said. “Looking ahead to our first league match in Gombe with Adamawa United, it won’t be an easy match but we have what it takes to come out with a great result. “No doubt, the fear among our supporters is understood. The fear that our continental guest may have taken its toll on the players does not hold water as we have fresh legs to perfectly defend our colours. It will be a good start for us in Gombe.”
