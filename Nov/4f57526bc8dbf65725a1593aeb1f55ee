Six months into his administration as governor of Imo State, Chief Emeka Ihedioha says his government has procured a total of 25 road contracts worth over N40 billion.
The 25 projects spread across the state, include the three key exit routes from the state capital – Owerri/Orlu road, Owerri/Okigwe road, Owerri/Umuahia – all of which are federal roads.
Ihedioha, who spoke on Monday during an interaction with newsmen in Owerri, the state capital, also informed that no fewer than 16 notable construction companies were on site in Imo State working on the 25 roads.
The governor noted that all the affected companies, after due procurement processes, have been mobilized with a 15 percent retainer.
He added: “For every construction company that is working in Imo State today, the condition is that we must inspect and evaluate your equipment; the company must open an office in the state and employ Imo citizens.”
The governor, however, lamented the weight of the liabilities he inherited from his predecessor, which is proving to be beyond his wildest imagination.
