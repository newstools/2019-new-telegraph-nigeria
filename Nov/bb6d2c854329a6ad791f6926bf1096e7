   A nongovernmental organisation known as Search for Common Ground has tasked all the relevant stakeholders involved in the Bayelsa State governorship election to give peace a chance as Bayelsans go to the polls. Speaking in Yenago on Wednesday, the Media and Communications Coordinator of the NGO said it was greatly concerned with this bad development, seeing the provocative actions of political party supporters and hate speeches coming from the two major parties in the state. The group said: “This constitutes serious danger to the election and period beyond. For instance the carrying of coffins during campaigns with inscription of another parties name on it. The numerous verbal attacks by the governorship candidates and party supporters using online platforms to post derogatory comments about their opponents.” The group said that women have expressed fear to vote after witnessing a violent campaign that included open death threats between opposition party supporters.
