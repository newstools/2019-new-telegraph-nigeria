In a bid to secure his release from detention in Dubai, lawyers to the immediate past Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke (SAN), have written the International Police Organization (INTERPOL) and his successor in office, Abubakar Malami (SAN). The former minister was, on November 11 arrested in Dubai where he had been on self-exile since 2015. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had charged Adoke to court over his alleged role in the $1.1 billion Malabu Oil scam. In a letter sent to the Interpol headquarters in Lyon, France, Adoke contended that his arrest was based on an arrest warrant already quashed by the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, which earlier issued it. Titled, ‘Notice of judgement’, the letter was signed on his behalf by a lawyer, Oluchi Uche, in the law firm of his lead counsel, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN). The letter reads in part: “Our client is the 9th defendant in charge number FCT/ HC/CR/124/2017 between the Federal Government of Nigeria vs Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Ltd & 10 others. “We write on behalf of our client to bring to the notice of your honourable office, the enrolled order of the court, dated October 25, 2019, Justice DZ Senchi vacating the earlier bench warrant issued against our client. “We respectfully bring to your notice the above judgement of the court to which there is neither any appeal nor a reversal for your necessary information and action.” Also, in a separate letter by his lawyers to the AGF’s office, Adoke called on Malami to attest the judgement of the FCT High Court which set aside the earlier warrant of arrest issued against him. The letter, titled ‘Application for attestation’, was dated and received by the AGF’s office on November 14. “We respectfully apply to your honourable office to attest to the said enrolled order,” the letter stated.
