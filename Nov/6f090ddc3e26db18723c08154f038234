 U NICEF, yesterday said it would focus more on provision of technical support than services in Nigeria and other areas of its operations.   Its Chief of Field Office in Enugu State, Mr. Ibrahim Conteh disclosed this during 2019 annual review and planning meeting of UNICEF in Awka, Anambra state.   He explained that Nigeria had the capacity to sufficiently provide the requisite services and programmes for children in the country.   Conteh said that if ample percentage of budgets at various tiers of government was set aside for children and children-related projects/programmes, Nigeria would have secured better future for the nation. According to him, if a nation used about 40 per cent of its budgets allocation on security, such a country would continue to increase its security votes because it had failed to provide for sustainable growth and development.   However, Conteh declared that there was the need to provide and sustain conducive environment for children’s development through deliberate policies that would give priority to issues about children.  He assured Nigeria that UNICEF would remain committed to ensuring that the last child was captured in programmes such as immunization as a child not immunized would pose a risk to others.  “A nation where children don’t have appropriate environment to develop is at risk. We want governments to focus more on children in budgets.  We are moving from services to technical support, how we can develop and improve on sector plans,” he stated.
