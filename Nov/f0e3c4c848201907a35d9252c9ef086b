Onyekachi Eze, ABUJA National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus has charged governors elected on the platform of the party to cut down wastages to be able to prepare for the future. Secondus, who spoke at a two-day summit organised by the  PDP Governors Forum on Internally-Generated Revenue (IGR) which held Wednesday in Abuja, warned the governors against reliance on federal allocation. The National Chairman, who was represented by National Financial Secretary, Abdulahi Maibasira, said improved revenue by itself was not enough, adding state must demonstrate prudence in the management of resources to meet the needs of the people. “The myriad of problems facing the country, like poor infrastructure, poverty and the likes, necessitate the need for more sources of fund. “But increased IGR may not solve the problem. The best was to do this is to be prudent in the management of resources. There must be a cut down in waste to be able to prepare for tomorrow.” Secondus expressed the hope that the summit would find solutions to the revenue issues hindering the performances of government, and advised the summit to examine issues of taxation, double taxation, secret tax codes, the ease of doing business, and the structure of government. “We need to make revenue base count and make the country work. We can’t get the country working unless we do the needful,” Secondus stated. He stressed the need for increased revenue to match the increasing population and expenditure by government, adding, “we want to ensure that tax collected is used for the actual purpose of service provision and also duly documented.”
