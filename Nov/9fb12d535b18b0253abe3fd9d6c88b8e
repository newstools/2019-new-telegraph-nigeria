The Parish Priest of St. Patrick Ihuonyia, Amansi-Odo, Ezeagu Local Government Area, Enugu State, Reverend Father Theophilus Ndulue, has been rescued. Ihuonyia was abducted on Friday, while returning from the Diocesan Pastoral Council meeting held at Holy Ghost Cathedral, Enugu. Ndulue regained his freedom Sunday evening, though it is yet unknown, whether a ransom was paid for his release. The Enugu State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Ebere Amaraizu, who confirmed the Priest’s release, said he was released unhurt. The Director of Communications, Catholic Diocese of Enugu, Rev. Fr. Benjamin Achi, said that he was grateful to God that Ndulue was safe. He also asked God to expose the victim’s kidnappers in order to forestall future occurrences. Ndulue’s kidnap came barely 18 days after the deputy Rector of Queen of the Apostle Spiritual Year Seminary, Imezi Owa in Ezeagu Local Government Area; Rev Fr Arinze Madu, was kidnapped at the seminary gate on October 29. This latest abduction and rescue had brought to eight, Catholic priests kidnapped in less than eight months. And among those kidnapped, two were killed.
