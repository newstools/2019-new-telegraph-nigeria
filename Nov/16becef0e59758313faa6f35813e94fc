“The routing of the terrorists took place yesterday (Wednesday), 13 November 2019, sequel to the receipt of intelligence reports on the movement of ISWAP fighters in some gun trucks towards the troops’ location in Malam Fatori.
“In response, the ATF immediately  scrambled 2 Nigerian Air Force (NAF) attack aircraft to provide Close Air Support (CAS) as well as an Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platform, which provided enhanced situational awareness for the ground troops as they engaged the terrorists.
“The combined sustained, intensive fire rained on the terrorists, from the air and on the ground, caused them to beat a hasty retreat,” the DOPRI said.
