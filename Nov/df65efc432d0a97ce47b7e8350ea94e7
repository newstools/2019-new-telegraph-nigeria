A ll is set for another delightful and revealing art show as the second edition of the Ibadan Affordable Art Fair holds from the 6th – 8th December 2019. The initiator of the project, Oyinda Adelumola, in a statement announcing the show, said: “Affordable Art is an idea that came about because Ibadan was once the centre of art and culture.   “We want to put the city back on the map for art, making it a focus and locus in addition to Lagos which is densely concentrated. We seek to expand the market for art away from Lagos and bring more people to the art collecting fold.” She added that the opening day of the three-day event will be strictly for invited guests only, whilst the subsequent days will be open to the general public and all art lovers.   The second Ibadan Affordable Art Fair will feature works by various artists of whom 70% are Ibadan based, exhibiting ceramics, embroidery, photography, sculpture and paintings. Highlights of the Fair will include but not limited to: music, children’s art class, poetry et al.   The maiden edition of the show will featured works by various established and young artists, including Victor Ehikhamenor, Adewale Alimi, Ogaga Tuodeinye, Isaac Emokpae, Lateef Olajumoke, Bruce Prins, Joel Arueya, Lawrence Leo, Temidayo Beduru, Obi Chigozie, Anthonia Chinasa, Ato Arinze, Nathalie Djakou Kassi, Tega Akpokona and Peter Kiladejo.
