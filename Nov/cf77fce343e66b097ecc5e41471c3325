The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus has  called on security agencies particularly the military to allow the people of Bayelsa and Kogi states vote their choice candidates in Saturday’s governorship elections.
Prince Secondus, who condemned the needless killing of a voter in Nembe, Bayelsa State on Wednesday, urged security operatives to exhibit high sense of professionalism in their conduct during the elections.
In a statement Thursday by his Media Adviser, Ike Abonyi, the PDP National Chairman said that the disqualification of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate in Bayelsa State is a sign that God does want continued bloodletting of innocent citizens.
“Nigerians expect all stakeholders in the Bayelsa election to see divine hand in the disqualification of APC out of the race and respect it. That is a consequence of impunity and it should send a signal to all,” Secondus stated.
He said that from inception APC knew that it was not wanted in Bayelsa State accused the party of heating up the state to frighten the people from voting
