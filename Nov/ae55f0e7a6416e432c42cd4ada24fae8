…as Sheffield Utd hit back to deny Tottenham   C helsea recorded a sixth consecutive Premier League win for the first time since their title-winning season of 2016-17 as they moved up to second in the table. The Blues’ victory over Crystal Palace means they are now five points behind leaders Liverpool. Frank Lampard’s side moved above Manchester City, who play leaders Liverpool on Sunday. Tammy Abraham’s 10th league goal of the season and Christian Pulisic’s header ensured the win against a resolute Palace side who barely got out of their own half during the first period. Palace’s defeat, their third in four games, leaves them 10th in the table. Meanwhile, George Baldock’s fortuitous opener saw Sheffield United stretch their unbeaten run to five games with a deserved draw at Tottenham, who remain without a win in the league since September. Baldock’s mis-hit cross – which came moments after the Blades had a goal disallowed for offside by the video assistant referee – evaded everyone inside the Spurs penalty area before finding the bottom corner. The visitors were by far the better side but fell behind when Son Heung-min capitalised on Enda Stevens’ failed clearance before slotting the ball through Dean Henderson’s legs. McGoldrick thought he had equalised just two minutes after Son’s opener, but VAR replays showed that Lundstram’s toe had been marginally offside in the build-up – a decision that was so close it took almost four minutes to make. The points lift the Blades up to fifth in the table, while Spurs drop to 12th.
