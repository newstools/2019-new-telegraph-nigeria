A yet-to-be identified pregnant woman was yesterday crushed by a train at the Uratta axis of Obuda community in Aba, Abia State. According to eyewitnesses, the deceased was on a commercial motorcycle when the incident happened. One of the eyewitnesses said: “The woman made several attempts to compel the cyclist to allow the train to first past, but the cyclist refused to heed. The woman landed on the track while attempting to escape. The train crushed her head.” Another eyewitness noted that the cyclist, who escaped, ran away with his motorcycle immediately the accident occurred. “As they approached the train track, the train was too close. The cyclist wanted to ride pass the track before the train, but the woman tried to make him stop. When he refused to listen to her, she jumped off the motorcycle and the train crushed her. The woman died at the spot,” said the eyewitness. It was gathered that several hours after the accident, the woman’s remains were still at the train track. Attempts to get the reaction of the Railway Police in Aba, was unsuccessful.
