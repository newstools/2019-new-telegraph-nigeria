     The Imo State Commissioner for Education, Prof. Viola Onwuliri has commended the state Governor, Emeka lhedioha for paying the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) counterpart funds up to date. Onwuliri gave the commendation when she paid a working visit to the Imo State Universal Basic Education Board (IMSUBEB) Headquarters, Port Harcourt Road, Owerri. This is also as she observed with dismay that the immediate past administration stopped paying UBEC counterpart funds since 2016. The Commissioner, however, reminded the management and staff of the Board, that they are also an integral part of the Ministry of Education. Consequently, she directed the Executive Chairman to seek approval before taking any action on official matters. The Education Commissioner decried rampant allegations of racketeering and extortions among IMSUBEB staff with regards to the ongoing employments and the award of contracts, warning that anybody caught in any illegal dealings, would be sanctioned accordingly. She reiterated that the employment process would be transparent and merit based and that proficiency in lgbo language and qualifications in education would be added advantages. Earlier in his remarks, the Executive Chairman of the Board, Prof. Obioma lheduru, stated that the Board is concerned with basic education which is the foundation for learning. He said that IMSUBEB is an offshoot of UBEC, with 50 percent funding from the Federal Government and 50 percent from the State Government. Furthermore, he disclosed that the Board is presently assessing the 2016 and 2017 funds from both the federal and state governments, as a total of 275 projects have been identified out of which 175 are new ones. Prof. Iheduru informed the commissioner that Imo State is up to date in the payment of its counterpart funds.
