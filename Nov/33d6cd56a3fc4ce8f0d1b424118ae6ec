*Says vote buying, deployment of arms are early danger signs Pauline Onyibe, Yenago A non-governmental organisation, YIAGA Africa, under its ‘Watching the Vote (WTV)’ programme, has said it has identified early warning signs of trouble ahead of Saturday’s governorship election in Bayelsa State with its observers noticing the deployment of political thugs and stockpiling of arms. Speaking on Thursday in Yenagoa, the state capital, during a media parley were the group reeled out their findings so far ahead of the election, the representative of the NGO, Cynthia Mbamalu said that earlier the group had deployed about 520 observers to the eight local government areas of the state for the purpose of monitoring the election. ‘Watching the Vote’ she said is a comprehensive study of the electoral process which included the observation of the political parties’ primaries and pre-election environment across the state. YIAGA Africa said that it was therefore foreseeing the outbreak of violence in Yenagoa and Sagbama LGs because of the recruitment of thugs. Already their fears played out on Wednesday at Nembe Local Government where many were feared dead, including a media worker, after a clash by supporters of the two main parties, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC) during a rally there. Mbamalu also said that the observers noticed physical and verbal violence in Southern Ijaw, Yenagoa, Brass, Nembe, and Sagbama local government areas. On trading of Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs), Cynthia Mbamalu said: “In Yenagoa, MTV findings revealed that some voters in Opolo and Gbararian areas were selling their PVCs for between N500 and N1,000.”
