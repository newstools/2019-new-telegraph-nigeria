The Senate yesterday summoned the Comptroller- General of the Nigerian Customs Service, Hamid Ali, to appear and explain other ways of addressing border issues without placing ban on the supply of fuel to border communities. The decision followed a motion entitled, “the need to revisit the Suspension Order placed on the Supply of petroleum products to border towns by the Comptroller- General of Nigerian Customs Service (NCS)”, sponsored by Senator Odebiyi, Tolulope Akinremi (Ogun West). The senators also called on the Comptroller-General of the NCS to urgently explore the use of modern technological devices in the tracking, management, and scheduling of petroleum trucks that undertake business along the border towns. They also called on the Customs boss to initiate a comprehensive audit of all petroleum stations and suppliers across the border communities, in a bid to closely monitor their movements by mandating each moving truck to have a tracking device that is monitored by the Service in a wholesome manner. The Senate further mandated its Committee on Customs to summon the Customs CG, with a view to working out a viable economic framework/ policy that could further mitigate the sufferings of the people, and communities across the border areas. It also directed Customs to ensure a steady supply of petroleum products through the identified suppliers and registered filling stations across all the border towns and communities as a temporary palliative measures; and initiate a holistic policy approach, with the same vigour on the nation’s waterways. Leading debate on the motion, Senator Odebiyi noted that “this directive was a knee-jerk approach to a modern day problem, saying that it was obsolete, when compared to the array of technological solutions that could be explored to save the country of the menace.
