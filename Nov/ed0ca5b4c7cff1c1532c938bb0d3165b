…insists Eagles’ll take maximum points  Super Eagles skipper Ahmed Musa has voiced out the concerns of his teammates who will play on the synthetic pitch when they face Lesotho in Maseru in their second 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifying match on Sunday. Eagles will be looking to consolidate on their 2-1 win over Benin Republic in their campaign opener in Uyo when they face Lesotho on Sunday but the Al Nasr of Saudi forward said it was going to be a difficult game for his side because they will play on a surface that they are quite unfamiliar with. ”We are going to play on an artificial pitch; it is not that easy because some of the players are not used to playing on synthetic pitch. ”But we know what everybody expects from us so we are going there to do our best to win,” he said. Ranked 138th in the latest FIFA ranking, Lesotho registered an impressive 1-1 draw against hosts Sierra Leone (117th) in their Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers Group L opener in Freetown and Musa insisted his side could pick all points in Maseru. ”As you can see, it was a tough game for the team today but at the end of 90 minutes, we have three points so we are going over there to have another win because we know that the game is going to be very tough.” Musa played a bit part role in the victory over Benin Republic after he came on late in the game and the skipper said he had no problem with playing from the bench if that would help the team. “For me, I don’t have to play. If the coach wants me to play I will play but if he does not, I won’t. For me, I advised we can start the team that played against Brazil because they played very good. “As you can see, the young players are coming up and we have to give them a lot of chance. Maybe Musa is not going to be here for a long time so we have to start grooming lots of them. “Captaincy changes nothing for me,” he said.
