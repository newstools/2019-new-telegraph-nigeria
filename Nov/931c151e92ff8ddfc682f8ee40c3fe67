The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said it would challenge the outcome of last Saturday’s governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi States at the tribunal.  The party also said it would file actions in court against identified officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security officials who allegedly aided the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the violent rigging of the election.  PDP said in a statement Tuesday by Kola Ologbondiyan that it would not fold its hands and watch the mandates given to its candidates in Kogi and Bayelsa States, Engr. Musa Wada and Senator Douye Diri taken away from them.  “Indeed, the nation is still at shock over the brazen show of violence, where security forces coordinated the invasion of polling units, shooting and killing of voters and carting away of ballot boxes to government facilities where results were altered and fictitious figures given to INEC to declare the APC candidates as winners.  “Nigerians watched with horror as APC thugs and security forces traumatized and held voters hostage, murdered our compatriots, injured and maimed many more in violent attacks that involved the deployment of police helicopters.  “Our party has been made aware of the roles played by the Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu as well as the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu in the elections,” PDP said.  It urged officials INEC and security agencies to do some introspections on the anguish they have caused the people from the two states since the results of the elections were announced, and said it would not hesitate to expose such ignoble roles at the appropriate time.
