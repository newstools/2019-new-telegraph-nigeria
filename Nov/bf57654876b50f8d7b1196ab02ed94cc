P olicemen yesterday foiled attempt by armed robbers to raid the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in Benin, Edo State.  The robbers had attempted to break into the CBN when a bullion van carrying cash to a commercial bank was about leaving the CBN premises.  The robbers were, however, repelled by the superior fire power of the armed police security team at the bank during an exchange of gun fire.  Residents, pedestrians and motorists on the busy Akpakpava Road were forced to scamper into safety as guns boomed endlessly.  At the end of the exchange of gun fire, which lasted for a few minutes, the robbers took to their heels. No casualty was recorded in the attempted raid on the apex bank. As at the time of filing this report, more security agents have been drafted from the state police command to beef up security at the CBN. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Chidi Nwabuzor, could not speak on the matter. The PPRO said he was in Abuja for an official duty.
