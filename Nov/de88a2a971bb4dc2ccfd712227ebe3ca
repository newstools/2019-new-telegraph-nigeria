Richard Mofe-Damijo, Nigerian veteran actor better known as RMD, says acting as father to Mike Edwards, a former Big Brother Naija (BBNaija) housemate, in a yet-to-be revealed movie is something he will cherish. The veteran actor took to his social media page to announce the new collaboration with the reality TV star in the upcoming movie — which also turns out to be Mike’s Nollywood debut. According to him, his new relationship with the Mike would enable his daughter who has been a long fan of the BBNaija star finally have access to him. “Meet my new son mike of bbn2019. I love my job. I get to not only meet people but be their friends or father or brother. All through the big brother season my 17 year old daughter was one of those rooting for Mike and here I am about to play his dad and begin a new journey,” he wrote. “Reveal later. See why I will always remain a cool dad? Imagine my daughter this Christmas back home telling all her friends that she can call and speak to him anytime… So the question… do we look like father and son?” Mike, who emerged the runner-up of the 2019 BBNaija, recently recounted how he went from being a “homeless athlete” fighting to represent Nigeria to a household name who can no longer walk into a local grocery store or bank without calling “too much attention.” Fresh off his emergence as champion at the SPAR British Athletics Indoor, Mike, whose father is Jamaica and mother is Nigerian, had said in March 2018, that he was overlooked for many years by the West African nation.
