The equities market closed yesterday on a positive note to commence the weekly trading activities on the upswing after the market also closed green last Friday. The market performance indices, NSE ASI, appreciated by 0.16 per cent. The upswing, according to market watchers, was driven by bargain hunting activities on the back of undervalued stocks following CBN’s recent policy directive. According to analyst at Cordros Capital, “in our view, the still compelling valuations and attractive dividends yields have driven market performance over the past few weeks, a reaction to a limited outlet for investments given recent policy directives limiting domestic participation in the FI market. In the short term, we expect that stock market will continue to benefit, especially as FI yields remain on the downtrend.” Consequently, the All-Share Index grew by 44.36 basis points or 0.16 per cent from 26,991.42 index points last Friday to 27.035.78 while the market capitalisation of equities appreciated by N21 billion to close at N13.027 trillion from N13.048 trillion.
