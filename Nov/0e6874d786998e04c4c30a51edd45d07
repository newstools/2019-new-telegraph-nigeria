European Union has urged security agencies to be neutral in the discharge of their duty within the framework of the electoral law in light of the elections taking place on Saturday in Kogi and Bayelsa state. Speaking on Friday during a press conference in Lokoja, the capital of Kogi State, the Head of Delegation, European Union Delegation to Nigeria and to the Economic Community of West African States, Ambassador Ketil Karlsen, said they are in Kogi and Bayelsa states to support the consolation of democracy in Nigeria and not there in support of any political party and candidate. The European Union team, which comprises many foreign officials from the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland and Austrian embassies, also implored the citizens of Kogi and Bayelsa to come out and vote for the candidates of their choice, noting that “the beauty of democracy is for people to come out and vote candidates they believe will help improve their socio-economic conditions.” The EU, while discouraging the electorate from vote buying, noted that: “In any democracy, elections should be about a competition of ideas and serving the people. Therefore, vote buying is illegal and should not be encouraged. We hope that tomorrow’s elections reflect this.”
