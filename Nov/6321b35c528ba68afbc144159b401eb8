Personnel of the Imo State Fire Service Wednesday rose to the occasion when they were called upon to tackle a fire outbreak at the Ikenegbu branch of the Access Bank, Owerri.
The fire that started from a back office of the bank did not eventually make it to the main office before it was quelled by the fire fighters.
When our correspondent visited the bank, however, the fire engine was still stationed at the back exit of the bank that gave the firefighters direct access to the burning office.
Heaps of burnt documents and files were sighted within the bank by our correspondent while staff of the bank were gathering and bringing out more burnt articles that did not survive the fire incident.
It was apparent, however, that apart from the documents and files, there were no serious damages immediately noticeable at the scene of the fire incident.
One of the firefighters, who confided in our correspondent, noted that they were yet to determine the exact cause of the fire outbreak, adding that the little damage that occurred was because the fire was detected late before they were alerted.
