Pastor Mathew Ashimolowo, Bishop Tudor Bismark, Dr. Mensa Otabil, Bishop Wayne Malcolm and other ministers of God are to minister at the 2019 Kingdom Life World Conference (KLWC), organised by the Redeemed Evangelical Mission (TREM). The eight-day conference, billed to hold between Sunday, November 17 and 24, will hold at TREM International Headquarters, Obanikoro Anthony-Oke, Gbagada Expressway, Lagos. This year’s conference, which coincided with the 30th anniversary of Kingdom Life World Conference, is tagged: “Love that Passes Knowledge.” The conference, according to the organisers, will be heralded by an opening ceremony/act, ministration in songs and word. Some of the major highlights of the convention include the graduation of the God’s Army Bible College on November 22, and a special praise evening service tagged: “Zamar Concert,” which is expected to hold the same day, featuring various gospel artists. The Kingdom Life World Conference is the annual conference of the ministry that brings together Christians irrespective of their locations across the world. The conference, which began in 1990, the organisers said, had continued to attract anointed servants of God across the world, and not only members of the church, but men and women of God from various ministries in Nigeria, other African nations, United States, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Philippines and Germany. “Every year, we have delegates from various parts of the world, who are not members of this ministry, but who come to receive from God and testimonies from them have been very encouraging,” they added.
