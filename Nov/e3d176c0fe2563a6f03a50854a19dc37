The Chief Advisor, Sam Nkire Political Advisory, Chief Sam Nkire, has said the defeat of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Governor Seriaka Dickson’s candidate in last weekend’s election should serve as a lesson to would-be despots in Nigeria. Speaking after the announcement of the Bayelsa State governorship election result, Chief Nkire said Dickson kissed the dust the same way pompous despots kiss the ground in their final hours of humiliation. According to Nkire, part of the reasons why the PDP lost in Bayelsa State was that “Governor Dickson did not believe in zoning, fairness or democracy and therefore, single-handedly chose a wrong candidate for his party.” He was also of the opinion that another reason why the people of Bayelsa rejected Senator Douye Diri was that Governor Dickson, due to greed, wanted to replace Senator Diri at the Senate, a dream now “put on hold.” The erstwhile National Chairman of the Progressive Peoples Alliance (PPA),  seized the opportunity of the shocking Bayelsa experience as well as other recent experiences in other states, where despotic governors and political godfathers have bitten their fingers, to advise politicians to be humble and show gratitude to God and their people for the opportunities to serve.
