Justice Mohammed Liman of a Federal High Court in Lagos has ordered that a suspected internet fraudster, Ismaila Mustapha, also known as Mompha, be remanded in prison over an alleged N33 billion fraud.
The order was sequel to Mompha’s arraignment on a 14-count charge bordering on fraud, money laundering and running a foreign exchange business without the authorisation of the Central Bank of Nigeria by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).
He, however, denied the alleged offences when the charges were read to him.
Afterwards, EFCC’s lawyer, Rotimi Oyedepo, sought for a trial date and urged the court to remand the defendant in prison.
Responding, Mompha’s lawyer, Gboyega Oyewole (SAN) drew the court’s attention to his client’s bail motion. He said the motion has been served on the prosecution.
Oyedepo while acknowledging the receipt of the motion, however, sought a short adjournment to enable him respond appropriately.
He also applied that the judge should issue summons on some people the anti-graft agency planned to call as its witnesses. He listed some of the witnesses to include the Director of Trade and Exchange Department at the CBN, Ahmed Umar; and one, Enu Matthew of the Special Control Unit Against Money Laundering, Ministry of Trade.
Justice Liman while adjourning the matter till Friday for the hearing of Mompha’s bail motion and commencement of trial also ordered his remand in prison.
