If reports in Spain are to be believed, Lionel Messi will pick up his sixth Ballon d’Or next week. If that’s the case, Messi will become the most decorated player in Ballon d’Or history and go a long way to confirming what many people believe – that he’s the greatest of all-time. But before the Argentine gets his hands on the biggest individual prize in football, the Barca legend won another award on Thursday afternoon. IFFHS (International Federation of Football History and Statistics) have named Messi as the world’s best playmaker in 2019. It is Messi’s fourth win of this award after wins in 2015, 2016 and 2017. He joins Xavi having won four Playmaker Awards, with Andres Iniesta (2), Zinedine Zidane, Luka Modric, Kaka and Toni Kross having won the accolade.
