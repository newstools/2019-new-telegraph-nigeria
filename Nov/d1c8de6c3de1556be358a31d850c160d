The Government of Imo State has disowned an ultimatum issued by a Group, under the aegis of Coalition of South East Youth Leaders, giving herdsmen in the state 24 hours to vacate.
According to a statement issued by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Chibuike Onyeukwu, the group lacks legitimacy to speak for the state.
Onyeukwu described the report of the ultimatum as an embarrassment to the government and people of the state, urging members of the public to disregard it.
The statement read in part: “The group, led by one Goodluck Ibem, relied on an alarm allegedly raised by the management of the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, accusing herdsmen of destroying their farm lands and crops, among other concerns.
“The Government of Imo State, under the leadership of Rt. Hon. Emeka Ihedioha hereby dissociates itself and the entire good people of the state from the said ultimatum to herdsmen in the state.
“Imo State government is embarrassed by the development and has taken steps to prevent breakdown of law and order in the state.”
Onyeukwu said that efforts are being made to address the concerns raised by the management of the Federal University of Technology, Owerri and stressed that the Governor Emeka Ihedioha administration shall not tolerate individuals taking laws into their hands
