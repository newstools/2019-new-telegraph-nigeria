A Lagos-based trader, Mrs. Amuda  Adeleke, has slammed a N45 million suit on a former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, at a Federal High Court in Lagos over alleged unauthorised use of her picture for campaign on billboards across the country during the 2019 general election. In the suit marked FHC/L/CS/19, the trader alleged that Saraki, who was the Director-General of the Atiku Abubakar Campaign Organisation, engineered the unauthorised use of her picture on campaign billboards.  The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the party’s Presidential Candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and his Vice, Mr. Peter Obi, were joined as co-respondents in the suit.  In an affidavit in support of the suit deposed to by the trader, it was averred that on December 4, 2018, the agents of the Atiku Abubakar Campaign Organisation (AACO) under the leadership of Dr. Bukola Saraki led a campaign on behalf of Atiku and Obi to Oyin Jolayemi Street, Victoria Island, Lagos, to draw support for the candidacy of Atiku and Obi in the 2019 presidential election.  It was further averred that in the course of the campaign, AACO and Saraki began to personally engage individuals, traders entrepreneurs and other citizens on the said street including the plaintiff on their expectations in respect of the forthcoming 2019 general election.  It was further stated that during the interactive engagement, most of the individuals in the locality of the campaign including the plaintiff pledged support for Atiku and Obi due to the harsh economic situation in the country.
