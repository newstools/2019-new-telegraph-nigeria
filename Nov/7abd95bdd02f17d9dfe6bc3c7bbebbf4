Arsenal are lining up Freddie Ljungberg as a replacement for Unai Emery, according to reports. The Gunners’ 2-1 defeat at home to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League on Thursday evening could finally be the tipping point for the club’s hierarchy, who are set to meet on Friday to resolve Emery’s future. Arsenal have now failed to register a win in their last seven games in all competitions under Emery, while his out-of-form side are already eight points behind fourth-placed Chelsea in the Premier League, reports metro.co.uk. According to widespread reports, Ljungberg is now favourite to take over from Emery on an interim basis until the end of the season. The 42-year-old, who won two Premier League titles and three FA Cup trophies as a player at Arsenal, is currently part of Emery’s first-team coaching staff. ESPN report that senior figures at Arsenal are now viewing Emery’s position at the club as ‘untenable’. Ljungberg’s first match as manager could be this Sunday as Arsenal travel to Norwich City in the Premier League. When asked about his future after the defeat to Frankfurt, Emery admitted that Arsenal “are not in a good moment”. “I can understand now all the criticism about the team, about me,” said the Spaniard. “We are not in a good moment. My work and my job is first analysis and then prepare for the match on Sunday. Today we improved things, but it was not enough. “We need to win and to gain confidence. I think we are better than we are showing, the players, the coaches and me.”
