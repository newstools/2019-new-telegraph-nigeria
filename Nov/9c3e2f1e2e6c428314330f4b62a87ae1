F oremost lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chief Afe Babalola, yesterday said that the proposed Hate Speech Bill by the Senate was nothing but a vehicle to dictatorship.  Babalola, founder of Afe Babalola University, Ado-Ekiti (ABUAD), insisted that it was not purposeful to introduce another law to tackle false publications when there were existing laws already promulgated to take care of such situation. The bill, being sponsored by the Deputy Chief Whip, Aliyu Abdullahi, has passed the first reading at the Senate.   Babalola spoke at ABUAD in Ado-Ekiti yesterday when leadership of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Ekiti chapter, led by its Chairman, Comrade Rotimi Ojomoyela presented to him an award of excellence to appreciate his contributions to humanity and national development.   According to Babalola, the provisions of the proposed bill in its entirety clearly contravened Section 39 of the 1999 Constitutions which guaranteed freedom of speech.  He said: “This is the beginning of dictatorship. There are enough laws like defamation, libel and slander to deal with anybody who publishes falsehood against someone and it comes by way of taking the person to court. “So, it is of no need to making new laws to deal with somebody who publishes falsehood. There was no need whatsoever for additional laws to deal with that.   “Though, people are complaining because the police are not doing well by delaying prosecution of offenders.  “The Department of State Services did Irreparable damage to courts the very day houses of judges were ransacked at night because no judge will give judgement against a government when he has the impression that his house will be searched at night. “Ekiti has four major federal roads; Ado-Ijan-Ikare, Ado-Ikere-Akure, Ado-Otun, and Ado-Aramoko-Efon, bad enough, all of them are in bad shape. Some have even cut off like the one at Erio.”
