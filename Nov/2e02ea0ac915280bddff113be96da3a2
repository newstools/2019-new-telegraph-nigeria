A coalition of 16 governorship candidates in Kogi State Monday, condemned the call by some civil society groups for the cancelation of Saturday’s gubernatorial election election in the state.
Some civil society groups, who monitored the election, have been calling for the cancelation of the already declared poll, claiming the insincerity of the entire exercise.
But the group, at a press conference in Lokoja, the state capital, said the idea of calling for rerun, might lead to more loss of lives.
Addressing journalists at the conference, the governorship candidate of the Young Democratic Party, Dr. Sanni Shaibu Teidi, said the 16 candidates have since accepted the the result of the election, urging the losers to work with the winner of the election towards achieving accelerated development in the state.
“We congratulate His Excellency, Alhaji Yahaya Bello for the overwhelming victory at the poll and all others that participated in the election.”
While appealing to the winner of the election to be magnanimous in victory and prepare to mend fences for an all-inclusive governance, Teidi urged all Kogi stakeholders to accept the winner for participatory governance.
Governor Yahaya Bello, was on Monday declared winner of the November 16 gubernatorial election in Kogi State, a victory that has been rejected by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
