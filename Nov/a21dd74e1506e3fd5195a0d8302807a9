 I n what may be a landmark development, the Zamfara State House of Assembly yesterday abolished the controversial payments of pension and other entitlement for former governors, their deputies, Speakers and their deputies in the state by repealing the law outright.   This was contained in a statement by the Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the House, Mustapha Jafaru Kaura and made available to newsmen in Gusau, the state capital. Presenting the bill before the House yesterday,   House Leader, Honourable Faruk Musa Dosara (PDP Maradun1), urged his colleagues to as a matter of urgency, consider the complete repeal of the law which provides the jamboree pay for the former political leaders of the state at the detriment of the retired civil servants who have not been paid their entitlements over the years.   According to Dosara, the category of past leaders are collecting over N700, 000 million annually, which he said the present state economy cannot accommodate for now. Seconding the motion at the chamber Hon. Tukur Jekada Birnin Tudu (PDP, Bakura) said, “The abolition of the law is highly necessary as it’s detrimental to the socio-economic wellbeing of our people.”   After serious deliberations and contributions by the house members, the Speaker, Rt Hon. Nasiru Mu’azu Magarya,  directed the Clerk to the house to give the bill  first and second reading and later, the house went for a committee of a whole, in which thereafter, the bill went for a third reading and it was resolved that the bill has now passed into law and will be sent to the Governor for his assent.  With this development, according to the spokesperson of the state house of assembly, Mustapha Jafaru Kaura, all past political leaders in Zamfara State will longer enjoy any entitlements unless those prescribed by National Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission.
