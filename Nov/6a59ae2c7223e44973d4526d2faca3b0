K ogi Youth Amalgamated Front (KOYAF) has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies to be neutral and impartial in the November 16 governorship election in the state. KOYAF President, Abraham John, made the appeal while speaking with journalists in Karu Local Government Area of Nasarawa State yesterday. He said neutrality and impartiality of INEC and security agents during and after the forthcoming governorship election would enable the people to vote the candidate of their choice and would also enable peace to reign in the state. His words: “We want the election to be free, fair and credible, hence the need for our call on the INEC and security agents to be neutral and impartial in the electoral process. “We want to use this medium to strongly advise the security agencies and INEC to show their neutrality and unbiasedness by standing by their words that the elections in Kogi State shall be credible and violence-free. “ If security agents and INEC are neutral, the people of Kogi State will elect who they want and who will govern them in order to enjoy the much-needed dividends of democracy. “We also want to advise politicians who want to win at all costs to desist and let the election squarely be a decision by the electorate and people of Kogi State to decide who should govern them.” John also appealed to the electorate to come out to vote candidates of their choice freely and devoid of violence during the governorship elections in both Kogi and Bayelsa. He advised the electorate in Kogi to vote wisely in the overall interest of the state. “I want to urge workers in Kogi State and others to come out and vote the candidate that will change their lives positively. “Time has come for Kogi people to sit and assess carefully and vote the right candidate in the interest of development,’’ he said. The youth leader also urged the youth to preach peace during and after the forthcoming  governorship election.
