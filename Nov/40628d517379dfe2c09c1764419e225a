S uper Eagles players have been enjoined to replicate their clubs’ form in their African Cup of Nations qualifying match against Benin Republic today.  The Nigerian side will today face the Squirrels of Benin in the opening game of the AFCON qualifying series at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium, Uyo Akwa Ibom State.  Former Eaglets John Obuh said the Eagles are expected to defeat their west African neighbours because of the quality in  the team, saying most of the players have been doing well at their various clubs and that should reflect in the way they play today. “I know quite well that they will do well because of the way they perform in their various clubs. We have to believe in the Eagles; you can see that they have also been playing well in their continental engagements.  “They have good players abroad playing very well, so, we just have to make sure we give them the support for them to progress,” he said.  Nigeria’s former midfielder, Mutiu Adepoju, has also charged the team to go all out for a win today. “Well, this is a qualifying match not a friendly game and Nigerians should expect victory from the Eagles against Benin Republic. It is also important to win their first game in the qualifiers, so, I expect victory,” he said.  “The coaches are there to give the players the practices and training they need to put their best in the game and for them not to underrate their opponents”.
