Automobile dealers on Monday took to the streets of Lagos to protest the sealing of their businesses by the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS).
The car dealers, under the aegis of Automobile Dealers Friends Association, claimed that their business premises were sealed as a  result of a crackdown on cars suspected to have been smuggled through the land borders, which began on September 30, 2019.
Over 100 protesting members of the Association had from 10am walked from Awolowo Road Ikeja to the Lagos State House of Assembly.
The peaceful protest started at the office of the Federal Operations Unit of the NCS at Mobolaji Bank Anthony Way, Ikeja.
At the NCS office, Mr Morgan Ogbede, the Chairman of the Association and other executives engaged in a closed-door meeting with Mr Mohammed Aliyu, the Comptroller Federal Operations Unit Zone A and other officials of the NCS.
At the end of the meeting, the Comptroller addressed the protesters telling them that their grievances will be addressed.
Speaking on what led to the protest, Ogbede gave an insight into his meetings with officials of the House of Assembly and the NCS.
He said the NCS had promised to unseal their shops if the required duties were paid on allegedly smuggled cars.
