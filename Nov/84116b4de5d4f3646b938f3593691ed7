National Vice Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP), in the South-West and governorship aspirant in Ondo State, Dr. Eddy Olafeso, has perused the state’s debt profile, stating that the state has no reason to be dependent on loans in view of the resources at its disposal. Speaking at a dinner organised in his honour in Lagos at the weekend, Olafeso said it was inexplicable that Ondo State is in deplorable condition with about N131 billion foreign and domestic debts, besides a N50billion bond in the works, despite agricultural and other resources begging for attention in the state. “The case of Ondo State is comparable to what Bob Marley in his song titled: ‘Rat Race,’ where he lamented that ‘in the abundance of water, the fool is thirsty,’ hence, we are setting out to implement the state’s template for development, put in place more than a decade ago,” he said. Olafeso observed that though successive governments have tried their best to develop the state, the deplorable condition of roads and other infrastructures and government failure to intervene in the absence of public power supply in Ondo South senatorial district in the last 15 years was almost inconsiderate. In his remarks on the occasion, a former chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC)  in the State, Barr. Benson Enikuomehin, described Olafeso as a visionary leader whose time has come to turnaround the fortunes of the state. He said that from what he knew about Olafeso as a corporate czar, an intellectual, a former Commissioner for Information and Strategy and a party leader in the state and at national levels for over 17 years, indicate that he is sufficiently qualify to govern the state. Enikuomehim was later joined by a  colleague of theirs at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ife, Yemi Sotiminu and former Editor of Guardian Newspaper, Mr. Martins Oloja, a childhood friend of Olafeso who extolled the aspirant’s leadership qualities.
