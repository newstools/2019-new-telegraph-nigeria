The Bayelsa State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has called Governor Henry Seriake Dickson to concentrate on completing the uncompleted projects in the state instead of burdening the incoming government with fresh appointments.
Governor Dickson had on Friday sworn in about 32 permanent secretaries but in a statement made available to New Telegraph in Yenagoa at the weekend and singed by Alabo Martins the secretary of the party, APC called on Bayelsans to hold the ‘Restoration government’ responsible in the future if some of these decisions were reviewed for the betterment of the state.
The statement reads in part ”The attention of the APC Bayelsa State has been drawn to a recent government special announcement regarding the appointment of 32 permanent secretaries in the state civil service.
“We are also aware that there are several clandestine indiscriminate employment going on across various MDAs without recourse to due process.
“While we are not averse to such appointments, especially if they are in tandem with civil service rules and regulations, we wish to express our reservation with regard to the timing as the appointments are made less than three months to the expiration of the present administration, immediately after elections.
“If the outgoing administration was aware of the existence of these vacancies in the top echelon of the public service of the state and that the situation was creating a lull in the service, why the vacancies were left unfilled until the eventide of the administration?”
