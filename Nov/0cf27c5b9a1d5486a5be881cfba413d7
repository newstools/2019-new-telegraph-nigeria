There are indications that the Appropriations Committee of the Senate will lay the report of the 2020 Appropriation Bill before the apex legislative chamber tomorrow. This is as the Upper Chamber puts finishing touches on the N10.33 trillion 2020 budget proposal, earlier submitted to the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari for consideration and approval. The President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan had, a fortnight ago, said that the National Assembly was working towards the passage of the 2020 Appropriation Bill on Thursday November 28, 2019. In a move towards achieving this target, Lawan directed the Senate Committee on Appropriations to submit its report on the 2020 budget proposals on November 26. He stated that the committeeâ€™s compliance to lay its report on November 26 would facilitate the passage of the 2020 budget on November 28, before the National Assembly proceeds on Christmas break. The National Assembly has been making frantic efforts to move the country away from the present budget cycle and return it to a cycle of January to December. This is why the lawmakers have been working round the clock, to ensure that the 2020 fiscal estimates are approved early enough, perhaps before the end of this year.
