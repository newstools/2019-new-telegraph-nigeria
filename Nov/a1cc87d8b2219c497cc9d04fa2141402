*Calls for inquest into Bayelsa guber defeat Former president, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan said he remains a faithful and loyal member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and therefore had no reason to have worked against the party in the last governorship election in Bayelsa State.
Jonathan lost his state to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the November 16 governorship election.
Former Jigawa State governor, Alhaji Sule Lamido, in an interview with a national newspaper, alleged that the leadership of the APC and the government blackmailed Jonathan into working for the party during the election, and accused the former president of tradeding the state for his own freedom.
Lamido also added: “And the issue of Malubo, I think, played a key role.”
But the former president said blaming the PDP loss of Bayelsa State governorship on him is uncharitable, and challenged the party to carry out investigation on what led to PDP’s defeat in the election.
In a statement on Monday by his media adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, the former president said attributing the loss to him amount to “blackmail and red herring.”
He reminded Lamido that he campaigned vigorously and helped PDP to win Bayelsa governorship election in 2015, under the same President Buhari, his alleged involvement in Malabu scandal notwithstanding.
