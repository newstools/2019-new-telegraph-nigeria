The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of deploying National Commissioners and Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) with questionable character for the November 16 governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states.
The party in a statement by by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said it has a due diligence report on each of the commissioners.
“Our party recognises that while some are of clean records in their previous responsibilities, there are others who are known to be of questionable character and fared far below expectations in their responsibility,” the PDP stated.
The party told the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, to note that the deployment of  officials with known integrity issues was capable of triggering crisis and jeopardising the credibility of the electoral process.
“It is also important to state that Kogi and Bayelsa elections present an opportunity for INEC to show that it has become committed to free, fair and credible election without being influenced or manipulated,” the party added.
It called on the INEC Chairman to rescue the commission’s image with Kogi and Bayelsa elections by allowing the will of the people to prevail
