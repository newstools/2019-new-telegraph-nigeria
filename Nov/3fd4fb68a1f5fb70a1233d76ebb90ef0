Two persons were yesterday reported killed by gunmen at Agon village in Sanga Local Government Area of Kaduna State. The killing followed an attack on houses of the victims early Thursday, two days after three policemen were gruesomely murdered by gunmen at a checkpoint  between Fadan Karshi and Aboro village in the area. The incident left the villagers in fear as according to residents, there was no provocation to warrant the killing. The Vice Chairman of Sanga LGA, Alhaji Abba Abubakar Abba Umar, said those killed were Monday Kura and Emmanuel Madaki. Alhaji Umar said investigations into the matter by relevant security agencies had since commenced to track the perpetrators. He advised people of the area to be mindful of strange persons in their midst and promptly report any suspicious movement to security operatives.
