The House of Representatives Committees on Women in Parliament has made case the reservation of 50 per cent of elective positions for women in the country. It would be recalled that the United Nations affirmative action document, seeks at least 35 per cent political representation for women. But at the “women week roundtable”, organised by the committee in conjunction with the Policy Legislative Advocacy  Centre (PLAC) and the European Union, the lawmakers said 50 per cent should be the minimum in the next general election, in line with the 1999 constitution. Chairman of the committee, Hon. Taiwo Oluga (APC, Osun) while addressing the delegates, reaffirmed the position of the committee and regretted that women were facing extremely strenuous hurdles to representing their communities in parliament, as she urged for radical reforms. She extolled the quality representation of the deputy chief whip of the House, Hon. Nkeiruka Onyejeocha (APC, Abia) and urged political parties and the government to do more for the female gender.
