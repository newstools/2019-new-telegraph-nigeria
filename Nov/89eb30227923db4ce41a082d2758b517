President Muhammadu Buhari has vowed that the killers of Madam Achejuh Abuh, Woman Leader of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Kogi State, must be made to face justice. The President has ordered thorough investigation into the killing, insisting that any descent to barbarism would not be tolerated by his government. Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to the President, Garba Shehu, in a statement yesterday, said Buhari expects scrupulous investigation into the heinous murder. Madam Abuh was burnt to death in Wada/Aro Campaign Council, in the just concluded gubernatorial election in Kogi State. The President in the statement, decree that whatever could spur anyone to take the life of another human being, particularly a woman, who was burnt to death in her home in the most gruesome manner, was unpardonable. Buhari charged all security agencies involved in the investigation to do a thorough and expeditious job on the matter, so that justice could be served without fear or favour. The President said: “We must learn to behave decently, whether during elections or at other times. No life should be taken wantonly under any guise, and the fact that this reprehensible act occurred two days after voting shows primitive behaviour, which should not be accepted in a decent society.” He sympathised with the family of the deceased, vowing that the law would catch up with the malefactors, and justice would be done. “Any descent to barbarism, as was visited on the PDP Woman Leader, has gone out of the realm of politics, and is pure criminality and bestiality. Such evildoers must be brought to justice, irrespective of whatever allegiances they hold,” the President noted.
