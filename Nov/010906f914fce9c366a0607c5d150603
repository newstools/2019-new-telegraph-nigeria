Temitope Ogunbanke, Lokoja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) senatorial candidate for Kogi West Senatorial District, Senator Dino Melaye has condemned Saturday’s governorship and senatorial election in the state. Speaking to journalists in Ayetoro-Gbede after casting his vote, Senator Melaye said an election that is militarised, full of violence and ballot boxes being easily carted away by gunmen, is not an election. He said irrespective of the level of violence and snatching of ballot boxes, the people of Kogi State are ready to prove that the ballot is stronger than the bullet. His words: “I am happy that our cry that Yahaya Bello is trying to militarise the environment, he wants to kill and wants to be governor by all means, that he is unpopular, that he only wants to use violence to get back into Government House is already established. “All the arrests that have been made so far were APC members and they have all confessed to who sent them. We must see to the end of this matter; it cannot be buried. We will not allow it to be buried . “This is not an election. Election that is militarised, election that is full of violence, election where ballot papers and ballot boxes were easily carted away by gunmen, honestly is not an election. “If they (APC) are popular, they will not introduce violence. All the ballot papers that scattered after election was disrupted in polling units in my local government were PDP thumb printed to show my popularity and acceptance by the people. The difference between me and Smart Adeyemi is the difference between light and darkness.”
