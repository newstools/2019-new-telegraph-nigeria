The sustained border closure by Federal Government has continued to destabilise commodity retailers, especially those into food item business. Investigation by New Telegraph revealed that the situation had started creating an atmosphere of hopelessness since the Federal Government has vowed to sustain the closure till end of January 2020. Nigeria closed its land borders to both Benin and Niger in August in what the government said was aimed at curbing smuggling of goods, especially rice into Nigeria. The closure has led to increase in food prices and subsequently pushed up annual inflation in the country. Speaking on the development, John Paul, who sells food stuff such as rice, beans garri, noodles, among others at Egbeda market, complained that since the closure of the border his business had been affected in terms of both patronage and restocking. He said the effect of the closure was obvious, as he has both increased the price at which he sells as well as reduce the quantity he buys. Another woman, who pleaded anonymity, complained that the fairly used clothes she sells were now difficult to buy. According to her, before the closure of the border she used to purchase her goods from neighboring countries at cheaper price, but with the closure, she now buys here in Nigeria but at a high price. Before the border closure she used to sell her clothes for as low as N300 or N400 depending on the quality of the material, but now she sells them for nothing less than N600. Another woman, who also pleaded anonymity, explained that there were goods currently on demand but not available as a result of the closure. “Products such as sardines and some brand of sanitary wares are no longer in the market,” she added.
