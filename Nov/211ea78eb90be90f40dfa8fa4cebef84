Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu yesterday approved financial assistance for the victims of this weekâ€™s fire on Lagos Island to enable them to get over their losses. The governor, who also warned against undue interference by touts and other unscrupulous individuals, said his administration would deal with anyone who disrupted the process of financial disbursement, screening and enumeration of property and good lost to the disaster. The Director-General (DG), Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Dr. Femi Oke-Osanyintolu, disclosed this yesterday. Oke-Osanyintolu said the enumeration of the items lost and the owners of the lost property had begun. The DG promised that everyone, who lost property, would be captured in the financial assistance in line with the laid down procedure. Osanyintolu said the agency would involve market leaders and other stakeholders in the area to get the correct figure and rightful owners of the burnt property and goods. He added that a building, which collapsed due to the impact of the inferno, had been completely demolished to ensure the safety of the people in the area. On the amount approved as financial assistance by the governor, Oke-Osanyintolu said it was yet to be unveiled since the enumeration of the property lost and victims was still ongoing. He, however, said Sanwo-Olu was concerned about lifting the people affected by the inferno. The DG, who also warned residents to be safety conscious, lamented the hazardous and unsafe conditions created by some traders, who used heavy generators on topmost floors of multiple-storey buildings in the market. He said Lagosians should stop keeping inflammable items in homes and in offices to avert fire disasters.
