A YouTube gamer with more than two million subscribers has been banned from playing Fortnite for life after being found cheating in a game. FaZe Jarvis, part of the eSports group FaZe Clan, used “aimbots” during a public online match which he was streaming for a YouTube video. Fortnite maker Epic Games handed him an immediate lifetime ban as punishment, reports Sky News. He is also banned from attending Fortnite events or creating content around the game. Jarvis, 17, posted a tearful apology video to his YouTube channel, saying “it didn’t even cross my mind to think that I could be banned for life”. “This was a huge mistake and was completely wrong on my end,” he said. Fortnite Battle Royale is a shooter game where users play as a superhero avatar and compete against each other to be the last one standing on a dystopian island. Aimbots can be used to automatically focus weapons on opponents, making it easier to get kills. Jarvis, who has more than two million subscribers on his YouTube channel, was not playing competitively when he used the aimbots in the Solos battle royale mode and openly said he was using cheat software in the video.
