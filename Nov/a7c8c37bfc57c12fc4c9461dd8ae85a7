Emmanuel Onani, Abuja The just-concluded gubernatorial elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states, were characterised by the proliferation of illegal weapons, complaints of sporadic shooting, as well as snatching of ballot boxes. The elections also witnessed inadequate logistics. These developments militated against the capacity of policemen deployed on election duties, to provide adequate security protection during the exercises. The observation was made by the Police Service Commission (PSC), at the end of a monitoring exercise by two separate teams deployed in the two states. New Telegraph recalls that the 45 officials (25 to Kogi and 20 to Bayelsa), were saddled with the task of “benchmarking” the conduct of officers against the approved rules of engagement for the elections. The Commission, in a statement by its spokesperson, Mr. Ikechukwu Ani, however, commended the conduct of the police personnel on election duties, saying an interim report by its officials indicated that they were “professional”. “The Police Service Commission has expressed satisfaction with the role so far played by the Nigeria Police and other security agencies in the Bayelsa and Kogi states gubernatorial elections. The interim report of the Commission indicates that the Police were very professional despite numerous challenges in the two states,” Ani said.
