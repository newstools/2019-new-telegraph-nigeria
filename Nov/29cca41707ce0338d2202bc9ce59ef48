President Muhammadu Buhari has warned security agencies, including the Army and Police involved in this Saturday’s Bayelsa and Kogi governorship elections, against harassment of voters. The President said law enforcement officials must ensure that citizens are allowed to vote without harassment and intimidation. Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to the President, Garba Shehu, in a statement yesterday, said “any attempt to steal or hijack ballots must be stopped using all legal means. “In all democratic elections, there are bound to be winners and losers and the elections in Bayelsa and Kogi will not be different. All candidates should be ready to accept the outcomes and wherever they are dissatisfied, they should follow the due process of the law in seeking redress. There must not be a resort to self-help.” The President further said: “I call on voters in Bayelsa and Kogi states to exercise their franchise in a peaceful and orderly manner and in line with the law in all situations.” “The President wished the two states and their people a safe and credible exercise as they vote in these historic and suspenseful elections.” Shehu said: “Since the ban on campaigns was lifted a few weeks ago, their citizens have been called to attend political rallies… that sadly, have so far recorded not a few uninspiring incidents of violence and of intemperate use of language. “President Buhari has made a strong demand for exemplary conduct of non-partisanship on the part of election and law enforcement officials in the two states. All must carry out their functions with fairness and transparency; without let or hindrance and without fear or favour.”
