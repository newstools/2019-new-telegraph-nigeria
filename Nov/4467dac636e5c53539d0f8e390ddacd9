T he Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has inaugurated the Law Reforms Commission and the Local Government Service Commissions, with a charge to members of the commissions to support his administration’s zero-tolerance for corruption.  The governor, who noted that institutional reform was pivotal in the agenda of his administration, urged the newly inaugurated commissions to ensure efficiency and transparency in carrying out their mandates of driving key reforms in the state, and to compile new Edo State laws within 12 months.   Obaseki said the role of the Law Reform Commission was important to deepen the development and growth the state is experiencing, even as he expressed displeasure that nearly more than two decades since the creation of Edo State, the state could not boast of a compendium of Edo laws, as it still relied on the old Bendel State laws.   “I am giving you a task to do. And, within 12 months of your tenure in office you have to compile the laws of Edo State. As a state, we have received significant policy advancement in the area of education, healthcare, security and access to justice,” the governor stressed. Obaseki, however, said that the state’s policy directions were a clear departure from the past, adding: “Our laws must reflect Edo being the nation’s most progressive state with easy access to justice, business enablers and social benefits.” This was as the governor noted that the inauguration of the Local Government Service Commission was part of his administration’s commitment to strengthen governance at the grassroots level.
