Benue State Police Command on Tuesday said it has rescued a medical doctor, Emmanuel Orhembe from his abductors.  Dr. Orhembe, of Baaki Hospital was released about three days after he was abducted in the state.  The armed kidnappers had stormed his home of the medical doctor and forcibly whisked him away to an unknown destination.  Narrating his ordeal to newsmen, Orhembe said some gunmen had invaded his house and taken him away after they blind folded him  where he “was held in their custody for three days”.  He maintained that while in their custody, he was made to lie on the ground and beaten, “his head bruised with iron, and shot on the ankle and leg by one of the abductors”. Orhembe said they continuously asked him to provide money and when he said he did not have, they threatened to kill him if he did not provide it.  Luck, however, ran out on the abductors when the joint security task force of the police code named ‘Operation Zenda’ led by SP Justin Gberindyer burst into the matter and within days found and rescued Orhembe from the kidnappers’ den in the Mbayion forest.
