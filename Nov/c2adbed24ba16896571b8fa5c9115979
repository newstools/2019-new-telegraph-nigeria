Famous American songstress, Cardi B, may be storming Lagos, Nigeria, for a grand jamboree on December 7. And the industry seems to be bracing to play host to the captiveating lady of songs.  The fine crafts-lady from the Bronx may also be raising the excitement by introducing a subplot; coming along with her elegant daughter, Kulture.  Last year Cardi became a mother and she’s clearly loving spending quality time with her infant. The frenzy is so much that speculations are begun spreading that Cardi may head to Nigeria and Ghana with Kulture.  In early 2018, amidst nagging speculations, Cardi B appeared on Saturday Night Live revealing a baby bump, to announce her pregnancy to the world and has since beheld the birth of her beautiful daughter, being almost inseparable from her.   The rapper who in an April 2019 interview, stated that she doesn’t trust anyone with her child, might just hit the Livespot X Festival stage with Kulture. That’s if her mother and her sister don’t come along for the ride, or even her husband, Offset, as they’re apparently the only ones she trusts with Kulture.   So, if you’re as curious as many are, there’s only one way to find out – on December 7 at Livespot X Festival, Lagos.
