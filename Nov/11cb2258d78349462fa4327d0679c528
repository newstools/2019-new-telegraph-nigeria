The body of a missing woman, Charity Ohaka, has been found in a well in Rumuosi Community, Port Harcourt in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State. She was found four days after she disappeared. Some residents of the community, who could not explain her sudden disappearance, concluded that she had been kidnapped. The body of Ohaka, who hailed from Okporoworo community in Ogbakiri clan of Emohua Local Government Area, was discovered last Sunday, four days after some residents initiated efforts to trace her whereabouts. A member of the Community, simply identified as Goodnews, told journalists that, “those who were fetching water from the well complained of seeing fleshy particles in the water and that the particles were oily. We followed the stench that emitted from the well and decided to drain it only to find the body of Charity inside.” It was also discovered that her ceiling was broken, breeding another round of suspicion that it was the channel her killers passed to get into her apartment. Meanwhile, some kinsmen of Ohaka, who came from Ogbakiri to claim the dead, became violent, damaging vehicles and looting shops. It took the intervention of men of the state police command to stop the rampaging kinsmen from causing further damage in the community. The Rivers State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), Nnamdi Omoni, who confirmed the incident, said that the victim was killed and then flung into the well. He added that the body of the deceased had been taken to the mortuary for preservation, adding that the police have commenced investigation to unravel the circumstances that led to the incident.
