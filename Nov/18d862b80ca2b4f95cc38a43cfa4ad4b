The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State during the 2019 general election, Senator Buruji Kashamu, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari over the arrest of the former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Mohmammed Adoke (SAN), by the International Criminal Police in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. In a statement issued in Lagos  yesterday,  Kashamu said the arrest was a proof that the fight against corruption being championed by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration was working. The statement reads in part: “The arrest of ex-AGF Adoke is another step in the right direction in the anti-graft war of the President Buhari-led administration. It is gratifying that the long arm of the law has caught up with Adoke in spite of his attempts to wriggle out of the intricate web of corruption that he is trapped in. It is discomfiting how people get into public office, abuse the trust reposed in them and then turn round to avoid being held accountable for their actions and inactions. “It is good that yesterday’s men of power like Adoke are being made to account for their actions while in office. As AGF, Adoke carried on as if he was law unto himself. He acted with impunity and high degree of lawlessness. It was difficult to imagine that he was the Chief Law Officer of the Federation. How could the nation’s Chief Law Officer have engaged in unlawful acts? Now, the day of reckoning is here. ; and he is running from pillar to post to avert being held to account for his deeds while in office. The law of Karma has caught up with him; what goes around comes around. “I commend and congratulate President Buhari, the INTERPOL and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on the arrest of Adoke. The move has shown that the law is no respecter of persons. People can run but they cannot hide.
