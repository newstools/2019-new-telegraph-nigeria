Nigerian billionaire daughter, singer and disc jockey, Florence Otedola, recently met with singer Naira Marley and thereafter declared herself a ‘Marlian’. Naira Marley is obviously growing a huge and powerful fan base despite the criticisms directed at him. Joining the Marlians family; as his fans are fondly called, is the Nigerian billionaire daughter, singer and disc jockey, Florence Otedola, aka DJ Cuppy, who recently met with Naira Marley and went on to declare herself a ‘Marlian’. DJ Cuppy took to her Instagram story to share a video of herself meeting up with Marley. In the video, the two can be seen hugging amidst star struck smiles and then DJ Cuppy is overheard declaring herself a Marian. It would recalled that the news of how Naira Marley used his social media platform to heavily shade organisers of the Headies Award show, stating that his legwork is bigger than the award show, was rife. Judging from his recent performance in Abuja, his statement seems have left many people wondering if that may be true after all. His friend and fellow singer, Zlatan, was recently in Abuja for a show and Marley showed up to support.
