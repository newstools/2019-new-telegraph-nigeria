The fight against insurgency and other threats to national security is set to receive a boost, as the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) will soon take delivery of 18 additional aircraft.  The Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, made the disclosure on Tuesday at at the opening ceremony of a two-day capacity building workshop on strategic communications in Abuja. Accorsing to the CAS, the aircraft, upon delivery, will enhance the service’ operational efficiency in its fight against insecurity in the country. The CAS, who was represented by the Chief of Administration, NAF Headquarters, Air Vice Marshal Kingsley Lar, further noted that the service had procured 19 brand new platforms, in addition to the  reactivation of 20 unserviceable aircraft in the past four years.  “We have remained committed to the Vision of repositioning the Nigerian Air Force into a highly professional and disciplined force through capacity building initiatives for effective, efficient and timely employment of Air Power in response to Nigeria’s national security imperatives.  “In line with this, over the past four years the Nigerian Air Force has ensured steady improvements in infrastructural development and personnel welfare. Accordingly, the Service has executed over 900 infrastructure projects including office and residential accommodations, messes and recreational facilities as well as schools and hospitals, amongst others. As a result, we have been able to raise accommodation sufficiency from 35 per cent in 2015 to about 72 per cent today. This is despite the fact that the strength of the Service has almost doubled within the same timeframe.  “The unflinching support of the Federal Government has also enabled the Service to acquire 19 brand new platforms as well as reactivate 20 erstwhile unserviceable aircraft, while another 18 aircraft have also been ordered and awaiting delivery,” Abubakar said.
