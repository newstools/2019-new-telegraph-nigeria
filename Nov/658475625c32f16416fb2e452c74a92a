Action Democratic Party (ADP) governorship candidate in Lagos State in the 2019 general elections, Mr. Babatunde Gbadamosi, has condemned closure of the land borders by the Federal Government, saying such decision will undermine Nigeria’s economy. Speaking to journalists at the Salem Touch Awards held at the Lagos State University, Ojo, in Lagos, Gbadamosi, who was given the ”Creative Exponent Award” for his support for youths in the state, said the closure of land borders would have adverse effects on citizens both in Nigeria and neighbouring countries. He said: “The continued closure of land borders will have negative effect on the citizens, even both here and in neighbouring countries. “It is clear that that the agenda behind it is completely not for economic growth, because it will affect the earning capacity of people, and if that happens, many people will not be able to meet their needs. “Consequently, many sectors will be affected within and in neighbouring countries that have built large doses of subscriptions on us. The closure will more or less affect the economy instead of improving it.” Gbadamosi also stressed the need for government to open the economy in such a way to attract more trade and industries, noting that refusal of government to encourage and open up the economy would hamper the progress of the country.
