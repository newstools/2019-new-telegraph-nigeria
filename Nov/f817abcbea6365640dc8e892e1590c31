As part of efforts to clarify allegations made by former Governor Mu’azu Babangida Aliyu, the Governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello has invited the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to wade into the  $181 million Islamic Development Bank (IDP) loan saga.
The governor said the investigation would help to ascertain if the money had been released or not.
Former Governor Mu’azu Babangida Aliyu had two weeks ago accused and called on Sani Bello to explain how the $181 million loan from IDP, which had entered into the government’s account after he had left office in 2015, was spent.
Governor Sani Bello, however, insisted that it is only the EFCC that can come in to clear the air about the issue as the alledged funds have not been recieved or accessed by the government.
He declared at the official flag-off of the 2019 local government council election campaign in Minna, that none of the money had entered into the coffers of government.
Accordingly, he said, based on the allegation on the loan meant for fixing Bida Minna road: “We did not meet any money in government account when we came into office neither has there been any money of such received by the government.
“For this, we are inviting the EFCC to come and probe this government and the other government to see who is lying between us. But I still say that we did not meet anything in the account. EFCC should come and find out if the money as been released from that time till now.
“The national and state assemblies have approved the but we are yet to receive it. The money has not been released but if Mu’azu Babangida Aliyu said it has been released, EFCC should come and investigate who has taken the money.”
