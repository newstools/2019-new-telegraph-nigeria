The Senate has approved N10.069 billion as refund for project executed on behalf of the Federal Government by Kogi state. The approval was made amidst disquiet in the chamber by senators from opposition PDP who claimed that it was too much a coincidence to make the approval three days to the poll. Senate Minority leader Enyinnaya Abaribe, (PDP, Abia South) said the approval should be delayed by one week so that the refunded money should not be misused during election. “The witch cries in the night and the child dies in the morning. The approval comes when there is an election is on Saturday. The money should be delayed until next week so that it would not be misused,” he said. Earlier, Senator Barau Jibril (APC, Kano), said commended the Kogi State government for deploying the state resources to ameliorate the suffering of its people plying the dilapidated roads. He advised that the senate to immediately approved the Promissory note to the state so that other states should take a leaf from them. The President of the senate overruled and approved the money saying the state applied for the refund along with other states that had gotten their own.
