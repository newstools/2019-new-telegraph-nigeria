…says: ‘I underestimated the level of rot’  Governor Emeka Ihedioha of Imo State has said that never in the history of constitutional governance has any state been run the way former Governor Rochas Okorocha ran Imo. This is also as the governor added that he knew before he came into office that Imo State was poorly administered, yet what he met on ground, came as a shock. “The reality on ground was staggering; it dawned on me that I underestimated the rot in the Okorocha administration,” he said. The governor noted that all facets of government and every institution that would have aided growth and development of the state were utterly destroyed. Lamenting the weight of the liabilities he inherited, which are proving to be beyond his wildest imagination, the governor said: “During my campaign for governor, I told the people that Imo State was the worst run state in the federation. But when I got into office, to my shock, I realized that I underestimated the extent of rot and devastation in Imo State. “Today, no state in Nigeria has the number of Garnishee orders against it like Imo State. Every day you look for the Attorney General, he is in court trying to address litigation issues created by the abuses of process and violations perpetrated by the last administration. “Just few days ago, we went to the Imo Standard Shoe factory to evaluate some things, but we were shocked to see the place sealed up by the Federal High Court. “I can tell you without fear of contradiction that I did not inherit any functional or thriving industry in Imo State. So one wonders, what is the economic base of the state? So how do we transform the state without a viable resource base?” Ihedioha recalled that former Governor Ikedi Ohakim, who handed over to Okorocha, purchased more than 40 brand new trucks and bulldozers during his administration but not one of such heavy duty vehicles can be accounted for after the Rochas Okorocha administration.
