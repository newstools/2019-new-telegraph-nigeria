A Presiding Officer and official of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has returned N50,000 alleged bribe for him to compromise results in Igalamela-Odolu Local Government Area of Kogi State during Saturday’s governorship election in the state.  This was disclosed yesterday by the Returning Officer for the area, Evans Ashigwuike Pope, an associate professor, while announcing results from the council at INEC headquarters in Lokoja.  Ashigwuike said a Supervising Presiding Officer (SPO) told him that a Presiding Officer (PO) handed over the N50,000 offered by a politician as bribe to compromise the election.  “The SPO reported to me that the PO reported to him that he was given money to influence the result. He collected the money and the money is N50,000.  “Then he handed over the money to the SPO, then to the PO and finally to me. I have the exhibit here,” Ashigwuike disclosed before displaying the envelope that allegedly contained the money to the audience at the collation room.  When asked of the source of the money, the Returning Officer said the Presiding Officer has a report and it was indicated that the money was from an unknown person.
