The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to immediately delist the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the ballot for Saturday’s governorship election in Bayelsa State. The party said this was necessitated by two court judgements that disqualified the APC candidate, David Lyon and his running mate from contesting the election. PDP in a statement yesterday by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, told the electoral umpire that any vote cast for the APC in the election would be a wasted vote since the court judgements have made it clear that the APC is not in the election. The statement read in part: “The first was the judgement disqualifying the APC candidates over the presentation of false documents by the deputy governorship candidate, Biobarakuma Degi Eremienyo, which was followed by another judgement, nullifying the entirety of the APC primary that produced the candidates. “It is therefore trite in law that given the circumstances that have entangled the candidature of the APC, the party, accordingly, has no place in the November 16 governorship election and cannot lay claim to any vote.” The party, however, said that notwithstanding the disqualification, Lyon and other APC leaders should be questioned over Wednesday’s attack that led to the death of PDP supporters in Nembe. It described the attack as a crime against humanity, which must not be politicized under any guise. “Information available to the PDP shows that the attackers were known supporters of the APC, who have also been seen on several occasions in functions with APC leaders including the disqualified candidates. “Our party therefore stands in vehement rejection of any attempt to politicize the attack, insisting that the masterminds, facilitators and executors must be swiftly brought to book on the full terms prescribed by our criminal laws,” the statement added.
