At least eight US citizens with ties to Utah — including five children — were reportedly shot dead in cartel violence in northern Mexico on Monday in what is believed to be a case of mistaken identity. The victims, who hold dual US-Mexico citizenships, were allegedly caught in crossfire of two cartels in the Mexican border state of Sonora — near where they worship with Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. The shooting victims included a mother, identified by family as Maria Rhonita Miller, and her four children, and two other women and one of their daughters, Lafe Langford Jr. told the paper. Miller and her children were found by a relative inside the family’s burned out, bullet-riddled Chevy Suburban on the side of a road, reports the New York Post. Langford Jr. told the paper that 12 more people inside two other vehicles were kidnapped by one of the cartels. “All we care about is finding our missing,” Langford Jr. told The Tribune. “That’s all we care about right now.” Langford Jr. told the paper the other dead women were his relatives, Dawna Ray Langford, 43, and Christina Marie Langford, 31. It’s unclear where they were found. One of the missing women called a relative, who heard a woman screaming and other loud male voices, said Langford Jr. The families lived in La Mora, about 70 miles south of Douglas, Arizona. Authorities in Sonora state and the U.S. Embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
