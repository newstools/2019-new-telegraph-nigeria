Diego Maradona has resigned as coach of Argentinian first division club Gimnasia La Plata after two months in charge and the club on the brink of relegation. Gimnasia sit 22nd in the table with Maradona winning three and losing five times out of his eight games. Maradona’s decision to quit his post comes after Sunday’s announcement by Gimnasia President Gabriel Pellegrino that he will not run for reelection. Pellegrino has been at the helm since 2016 and the Argentina legend’s resignation is perceived by the local media as an act of loyalty to the club president, reports ESPN. “Maradona is no longer the coach of Gimnasia,” Pellegrino told Radio La Red. “He said that he was there to add not to subtract.” The presidential elections are held every three years and will take place on Saturday. Maradona had considered remaining in charge for the last three games of the year but has decided to relinquish the reins immediately. Pellegrino was responsible for bringing the 1986 World Cup winner back to work in Argentina for the first time since 2010, when Maradona left the helm of Argentina’s national team. Argentinian newspaper Clarin report that Maradona is also going through a difficult personal time and also has health issues. Earlier this month, Maradona, 59, played down concerns about his health and stated he was “more alive than ever”. Maradona left his job as coach of Mexican side Dorados de Sinaloa in June after nine months in charge to focus on his health. He underwent a knee operation before deciding to take the Gimnasia job on September 5. After Sunday’s game against Arsenal, Gimnasia play away to Banfield on November 29 before hosting Cordoba on December 8.
