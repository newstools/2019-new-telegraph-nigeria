A former APC national chairmanship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the founder of Progressive Solidarity Forum (PSF), Chief Ibrahim Emokpaire, has sent a strong message of support on the leadership style of the National Chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. Emokpaire stated this in a chat with journalists in his Abuja office yesterday. According to the former scribe of the APC in the United Kingdom, since Oshiomhole’s election as the national chairman, he has brought discipline and stability to the party. “Oshiomhole is in the process of institutionalizing party supremacy within the ruling All Progressives Congress, having gone through turbulent times and wade off the indiscipline that characterised the previous era when the likes of Sen. Bukola Saraki and Hon Yakubu Dogara emerged the Senate President and Speaker of House of Reps respectively against the party’s wish.” As far as Emokpaire is concerned, the loss of Rivers and Zamfara states are due to the selfishness, greed and indiscipline of certain individuals in the party. “Comrade Adams Oshiomole has now brought back some discipline to the party and has put in place ground rules of no-go areas for the party. Since he took over the affairs of the party, he has not lost any isolated election, referring to Ekiti, Osun and just recently Kogi and Balyelsa states.”
