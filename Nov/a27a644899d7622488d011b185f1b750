The Anti-kidnapping Squad of Operation Puff-Adder in Kano has rescued a four-year-old boy kidnapped by a relative of his who demanded a N4 million ransom.
The Kano Command’s Spokesperson, DSP Haruna Abdullahi Kiyawa said on Sunday at about 1500hrs, a complaint was received at Zango Division of the Force that unknown persons kidnapped one Abdulrahman Dalha ‘m’  4-years-old of Zangon Rimi Quarters, Ungogo LGA Kano State and demanded a ransom of N4 million.
Haruna said the Command’s Anti-kidnapping team of Operation Puff-Adder was immediately mobilised and directed by the Command’s Commissioner of Police to track down, arrest and bring the perpetrators to book within 24 hours.
“The operatives swung into action where community policing tools were utilized and that led to the arrest of the principal suspect, one Anas Isah ‘m’, 22-year-old of Zangon Dakata Quarters Kano, while planning to collect the ransom,” he explained.
DSP Haruna noted that suspect confessed to committing the crime and led Puff-Adder operatives to the house of his aunty at Inusawa Village, Ungogo LGA where the kidnapped victim was rescued.
The Police said suspects will be charged to court for prosecution after investigation is completed.
