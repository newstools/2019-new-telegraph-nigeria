Fans of former BBNaija Housemate, Tacha, have reason to celebrate following her return to Instagram on Wednesday, barely one week of going “Missing In Action”. The reality TV star’s Instagram page was reactivated on Wednesday, November 6, 2019. The post on her page indicates that she only started using the page on Wednesday. Tacha will be in Rivers state soon for what she themed a ‘Home Coming’. It would be recalled that about a week ago, it was observed that the former BBNaija housemate’s Instagram page had been deactivated. It is not clear if she actually deactivated the account herself or it was done by the social media platform. The reality TV star left her almost one million Instagram followers in shock after she deactivated her page on Wednesday, October 30, 2019. [Instagram/symply_tacha] As usual, no prior notice was given before the action. Her fans and followers have been left puzzled as to the reason behind their favourite super star’s decision to go MIA.
