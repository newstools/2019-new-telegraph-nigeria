Nigerian local-currency bond yields have dropped to 18-month lows as investors pile into the debt after the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) restricted sales of higher-yielding, shorter- term central-bank securities, Bloomberg reported yesterday.  According to the news agency, the average yield for naira government bonds has dropped 117 basis points to 13.03per cent since the apex bank moved to block individuals and non-bank firms from buying so-called openmarket operations, or OMOs, on Oct. 23. Nigerian investors don’t have access to a wide range of assets: “So after the central bank’s restriction on the purchase of OMOs, they resorted to bonds.  The yield will continue to moderate downward, and over time the borrowing cost to government will be lower,” Kunle Ezun, a currency and fixed-income analyst at Ecobank Transnational Inc. was quoted as saying.  The yield could fall as low as 12per cent in coming weeks, according to Omotola Abimbola, an analyst with Chapel Hill Denham Securities Ltd. By contrast, OMOs maturing in October next year yielded 14.58per cent on Thursday.  OMOs, which typically have maturities of less than a year, were originally used by the central bank to control liquidity and mainly bought by local lenders. But the market had been opened to other investors in the past two years to bring in the hard currency needed to keep the naira from depreciating, and OMOs became one of the main instruments used by foreign carry traders.  The OMO restriction is intended to discourage banks from giving loans to customers who will use them to buy high-yielding government securities, according to the CBN. It is one of the recent rules aimed at forcing banks to extend more credit to manufacturers and help spur growth in an economy that’s struggling to recover fully from a 2016 contraction.
