The Federal Roads Safety Corps (FRSC), Zamfara State Sector Command, has pledged to pursue incessant public enlightenment programmes and aggressive enforcement of traffic rules and regulations with a view to serving as deterrence to traffic violators. This was disclosed in a press briefing yesterday, by the sector Commandant, Mr. Wihioka Uche Chukwu, while commemorating this year’s World Day Remembrance for Victims of Road Traffic Crashes. Chukwu, who promised aggressive operations by the corps of the command in pursuance of laws guiding driving, warned that roads users should ensure total adherence to traffic rules and regulations, and respect for all roads signs for safer driving. He said: “The theme for this year’s commemoration is tagged as ‘Life is not a Car part’, and was carefully chosen to enable people of the world to reflect on the sanctity of life and the fact that once taken, it cannot be replaced. “Unlike the car parts that are replaceable, nations are simultaneously organising events to promote this theme with various activities lined up to mark the week. “According to the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) reports, greater number of people are being disabled for life on world roads through avoidable traffic crashes in the face of increasing motorisation, therefore, the need to address the menace through appropriate measures,” the sector Commandant stated. Chukwu also charged Corps of the Command, to, for the sake of respecting the Africa Union Executive Council decision and the United Nation’s resolution, arise to discharge their primary assignment in ensuring saving lives. “I am charging you to strictly work on the provisions of your duties without fear or favour on any traffic violator no matter what class he or she belongs to, but you should respect the laws and value lives anywhere and at any time,” Chukwu warned.
