Donald Trump spent more than two hours at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Saturday for what the White House said were medical tests as part of his annual physical. The appointment wasn’t on Trump’s weekend public schedule, and his last physical was in February. His Press Secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said the 73-year-old president was “anticipating a very busy 2020” and wanted to take advantage of “a free weekend” in Washington to begin portions of his routine checkup. She did not specify which tests he’d received or explain why the visit had not been disclosed in advance. Trump’s 2018 and 2019 physicals were both announced ahead of time and appeared on his public schedule, reports the Associated Press. Grisham said the president had “a quick exam and labs” and remains in good health. “The president remains healthy and energetic without complaints, as demonstrated by his repeated vigorous rally performances in front of thousands of Americans several times a week,” she said. Trump also spent time at the hospital meeting with the family of a special forces soldier injured in Afghanistan. And he visited with medical staff “to share his thanks for all the outstanding care they provide to our wounded warriors, and wish them an early happy Thanksgiving,” Grisham said. It was the president’s ninth visit to the hospital since taking office. Trump’s last checkup, in February 2019, showed he had gained weight in office. At 110kg (243lb) and 190cm (6 feet 3 inches), he passed the official threshold for being considered obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 30.4. That checkup, which was supervised by Trump’s physician, Dr Sean Conley, took more than four hours and involved a panel of 11 specialists. Saturday’s test came as House investigators on Capitol Hill were interviewing a White House budget official as part of the impeachment inquiry. Trump has insisted he did nothing wrong.
