2019 NPFL/LaLiga U-15 Tournament Most Valuable Player, Peter Joel, has returned from his LaLiga training in Spain. Joel who helped his team, Delta Force FC, to a third place finish at the 2019 edition of the tournament earlier in the year, travelled to Malaga, Spain last month where he trained with the Malaga C.F youth team.  As part of the trip, the player was able to enjoy very closely the Malaguista team and toured the La Rosaleda stadium and the city of Malaga. This trip which is the first time an NPFL U-15 player visits Spain, reinforces LaLiga and NPFL’s commitment to develop grassroots and juvenile football in the country.  Since its inception in 2017, the tournament has seen over 900 players participate and has also presented the opportunity for over 200 youth coaches to be professionally trained. “It has been my desire to play in Europe and it was a dream come true to have this experience,” Joel said on arrival.  “Although I spent a short time with the team, I learnt a lot and developed my skills especially in terms of my tactical and positional play. “I also enjoyed exploring the beautiful city of Malaga and since I returned, my wish is to become a legend of Malaga CF.” Speaking about the initiative, La- Liga Delegate in Nigeria, Guillermo Perez Castello appreciated Malaga C.F for giving Joel the opportunity to nurture and develop his talent.  He said: “We hope that this platform continues to enable as well as encourage other upcoming youngsters across the world to pursue their football dreams.  “We are once again delighted to have the opportunity to help in developing young talents across Nigeria. This country is very passionate about football and we will continue to aid its development through our partnerships particularly with the NPFL.” Also commenting, Chairman of the League Management Company, Shehu Dikko, expressed excitement with the outcome of the tournament and the impact it is making on young Joel footballers in Nigeria.
