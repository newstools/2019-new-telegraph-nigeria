Precisely five months after the arraignment of a self acclaimed herbalist, Jamiu Isiaka, who allegedly defrauded a Korean National, Keun Sig Kim, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has finally closed its case against the defendant.  The Ilorin Zonal Office of the EFCC had on June 11, 2019 arraigned Isiaka before Justice Mahmood Abdulgafar of a Kwara State High Court sitting in Ilorin on a six-count charge bordering on fraud and obtaining money under false pretence.  The self acclaimed herbalist was accused of obtaining the sum of N30 million from his victim under the pretence of helping him to secure a licence from the Federal Government of Nigeria through the Office of the Group General Manager of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).  Count one of the charge stated: “That you, Jamiu Isiaka (a.k.a Femi Adeshina ) between the month of April and September 2018 in Ilorin, within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, with intent to defraud, did obtain the total sum of eighty eight thousand, five hundred and twenty one dollars, forty one cents from a Korean national named; Keun Sig Kim by false pretences that the money was for the procurement of NNPC approval/marketing form and license certificate to buy crude oil in Nigeria, facts which you knew to be false and thereby committed an offence contrary to section 1 of the advance fee fraud and other fraud related offences act, 2006 and punishable under section 1(3) of the same Act.”  At the resumed hearing of the matter on Friday, the EFCC presented its second prosecution’s witness, Barrister John George Itodo, who is the counsel to the complainant in the matter.
