Worried by the continuous closure of the completed section of the Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano road, the House of Representatives has called for the immediate reopening of the road to motorists. It has also summoned the contractor handling the project, Julius Berger (Nigeria) Plc, the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Works as well as the Director (Highways) and Director (Construction and Rehabilitation) to appear and brief it on the state of the project. Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Works, Hon. Abubakar Kabir Abubakar, who disclosed this in a statement in Abuja on Sunday, said the action of the committee became necessary following series of complaints by well-meaning Nigerians travelling on the road. He said: “The ongoing rehabilitation and dualization of the Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano highway is causing untold hardship to motorists and other toad users plying the road.” Continuing, the chairman said: “They should immediately open up closed sections of the road that they have completed to motorists so as to reduce the long hours spent travelling on the road.”
