An Ikeja High Court, Lagos yesterday admitted in evidence the confessional statement made by two gang members of an alleged kidnap kingpin, Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike, alias Evans, to the police.  Justice Hakeem Oshodi ruled on the issue of voluntariness and admissibility of the confessional statements made by the fourth and sixth defendants after hearing submissions and final written addresses of both the defence and prosecution counsels.  Evans is standing trial alongside five accomplices; Uche Amadi, Okechukwu Nwachukwu, Chilaka Ifeanyi, Victor Chukwunonso Aduba and a woman, Ogechi Uchechukwu. All six defendants were docked on a two-count of conspiracy and kidnapping.   They were all arraigned on August 30, 2017 for the alleged kidnap of the Chief Executive Officer of Maydon Pharmaceutical Limited, Donatus Dunu, from whose family they allegedly collected the sum of 223,000 Euro (N100 million) as ransom.  The judge in his ruling said there was no evidence before the court to prove that the defendants were tortured during the process of obtaining their statements by the police.  “None of the defendants have been able to provide any evidence to suggest any sign of diuresis during this process.  “The fact the 4th and 6th defence counsels, Mr. Olanrewaju Ajanaoku and O. Emmanuel, did not raise the issue of a gun being pointed to the heads of their clients and the issue of a broken finger during the cross examination of the prosecution witness, leads to the conclusion that these speculations were an afterthought.   “The statement of the fourth defendant will be marked as Exhibit 8 and 8a while the statement of 6th defendant marked as Exhibit 9,” the judge ruled.  In reaction to the ruling of the court, the state prosecutor, Yakubu D. Osuala, thereafter, asked the court for an adjournment for continuation of trial. The matter was further adjourned till January 10, 2020 for continuation of trial.
