Precisely five months after the arraignment of a self – acclaimed herbalist, Jamiu Isiaka, who allegedly defrauded a Korean national, Keun Sig Kim, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has finally closed its case against the defendant.  The Ilorin Zonal Office of the EFCC had on June 11 arraigned Isiaka before Justice Mahmood Abdulgafar of Kwara State High Court, sitting in Ilorin, on a six-count charge bordering on fraud and obtaining money under false pretence.  The Isiaka was accused of obtaining the sum of N30 million from his victim under the pretence of helping him to secure a licence from the Federal Government of Nigeria through the office of the Group General Manager of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). At the resumed hearing of the matter on Wednesday, the EFCC presented its second prosecution’s witness, Mr. John George Itodo, who is the counsel to the complainant in the matter.  Itodo in his evidence in chief told the presiding judge that: “My Lord, sometime in 2018, my client called me that he entered into a transactions with persons parading themselves as group Managing Director of NNPC, Senior Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adeshina, the National Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Mrs. Amina Zakari among others.  “It appears to him he was dealing with fraudsters, I advised him to forward the documents to me, which he did, I then wrote a petition to the EFCC on his behalf. My Lord, my client is actually in a bad situation now, he has spent all his monies on this project.”
