(  now Access Bank),  Chinyere Oti and a former Account Officer of the same bank,  Odigboh Okechukwu, to two years imprisonment for defrauding the bank the sum of N25, 018, 467.00k. The convicts were arraigned on November 19, 2009, by the Port Harcourt Zonal Office of the EFCC on seven count charges bordering on conspiracy and stealing.  The charges were amended on April 25, 2019. Count four reads:  “Odigboh Okechukwu and Chinyere Oti on or about the  23rd day of October, 2008, at Diamond Bank Plc.,  Port Harcourt within the Port Harcourt Judicial Division did fraudulently steal the sum of  N20,  431,  342.05,  property of Diamond Bank Plc. by means of Diamond Bank Cheque No. 16216303 through an unfunded account in the name of Achufa Investment Limited operated by Odigboh Okechukwu and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 381(1) and punishable under Section 390( 9) of the Criminal Code CAP 37  Vol. II Laws of Rivers State of Nigeria 1999.” The defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges.  Their pleas led to a 10 -year-long trial.  The prosecution called three witnesses and tendered 15 exhibits while the defence called three witnesses. Delivering his judgment yesterday, Justice Iyayi- Lamikanra, found the two defendants guilty of the charges and sentenced them to two years imprisonment each or an option of fine of N1, 000,000 each.  She also ordered the convicts to pay a sum of N25, 000,000.00 as restitution to Diamond Access Bank Plc. The EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, said: “Trouble came for the two convicts when the former Diamond Bank Plc. petitioned the EFCC, alleging that its Manager, Rumukwrushi Branch, Port Harcourt, Mrs Chinyere Oti, fraudulently opened a current account for one of its customers and used the account to make fraudulent withdrawals and overdrew it to the tune of N25, 018, 467.   Investigations showed that the alleged customer of the bank never opened an account with the bank. Rather, Odigboh Okechukwu; an Account Officer with the bank used the customer’s photograph to open the account without the customer’s knowledge or consent. It was through the account the two convicts defrauded the bank.”
