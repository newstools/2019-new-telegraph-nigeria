*Ex-gov demands N3bn over alleged libel  A former governor of Ogun State, Chief Olusegun Osoba, has made good his threat to sue prominent Afenifere chieftain, Senator Femi Okurounmu, over alleged libellous publications against him. Osoba, through his lawyer, Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN), on Friday, dragged Okurounmu before the state High Court sitting in Abeokuta. Apart from asking the defendant to retract the controversial publications in two national newspapers, the former governor is also demanding a sum N3billion as aggravated and exemplary damages. The legal action was fallout of newspaper interviews published in July in which Okurounmu described Osoba as a “traitor and double-faced politician” who betrayed the acclaimed winner of June 13, 1993 presidential election, late Chief MKO Abiola. New Telegraph reports that Osoba’s lawyer had, shortly after the publications, given Okurounmu a 14-day ultimatum to comply with his demands. In a July 23 letter, Olanipekun had declared that the words employed by the Afenifere chieftain in defaming his client were weighty and far-reaching. The Senior Advocate of Nigeria claimed that his client’s “hard-earned reputation” has been seriously dented and damaged by the publications while “he has also suffered considerable distress and embarrassment.” He, therefore, demanded a retraction of the said interviews and a public apology to be published on the front pages of seven consecutive editions of the concerned newspapers. But in a writ obtained by our correspondent on Sunday, Osoba asked the court for an order of perpetual injunction restraining the defendant from further publishing libellous publications against him.
