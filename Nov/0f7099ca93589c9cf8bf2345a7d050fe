Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr is no longer comfortable with his contract terms with the Nigeria Football Federation and the 66-year-old German has given his employers a two month ultimatum to tidy up things or lose him to one of the countries who are waiting to hire him. Rohr said that as  from January 1, 2020, he would be free to engage  in negotiation with any of his suitors  if nothing is settled by NFF. “I’m ready to discuss as I have other federations who want me but I tell them that my priority is to discuss with the NFF. “But after January 1, I’ll be free to sign where I want. So I think the next step is to wait to see what NFF is doing,” he said. According to report, Rohr  insists he might be forced to quit the job if the situation is not quickly addressed. The Eagles are unbeaten in their first two group games of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers after the impressive draws against Ukraine and Brazil. Recently, the German tactician held talks with Nigeria’s Sports Minister Sunday Dare over extending his contract for two or three years, with his current deal with the NFF set to run out in March 2020. Meanwhile, Rohr is believed to be owed three months salary by his employers, the NFF. The wages are totalled $150,000 as he is on a monthly salary of $50,000.
