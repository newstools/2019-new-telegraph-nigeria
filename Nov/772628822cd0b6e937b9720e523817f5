…as Osimhen, Kalu shoot Nigeria to Group L lead  Super Eagles started their 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifying campaign on a winning note after they defeated the Squirrels of Benin republic at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium on Wednesday. The victory moves the Super Eagles top of Group L after one round of fixtures, with Sierra Leone and Lesotho having played out a 1-1 draw in Freetown at the same time. Striker Victor Osimhen scored a second half penalty to cancel out Stephane Sessegnon’s early goal  and Samuel Kalu produced a sublime efforst later in the game to earn the Eagles the victory. Gernot Rohr made four changes to the side that executed the last international game versus Brazil, with Daniel Akpeyi, Wilfred Ndidi, Ola Aina and Samuel Kalu afforded starting spots in Uyo. Nigeria suffered a blow after just three minutes in when some sloppy defending allowed Sessegnon to slot past  Akpeyi and put the visitors ahead. Gernot Rohr’s troops were stunned following Benin’s goal, and they struggled to regain their composure in the aftermath of their West African neighbours going in front. The Super Eagles only settled as half-time approached with Samuel Chukwueze hitting the frame of the goal in the 40th minute. The three-time African champions weren’t to be denied, though, as Victor Osimhen dispatched a penalty on the stroke of the break after Ola Aina was fouled. Rohr’s men started the second-half the brighter of the two sides without really making Fabien Farnolle work in the Benin goal. The hosts completed the comeback just after the hour mark. Bordeaux wideman Kalu beat a couple of defenders and shot past Farnolle, who had no chance as the effort was cleanly struck and well-placed.
