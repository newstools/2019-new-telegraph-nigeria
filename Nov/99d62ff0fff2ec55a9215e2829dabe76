Stylish lawyer and ageless former beauty queen, Helen Prest-Ajayi is set to step out to town in December as the guest speaker of this year’s Miss Hotlegs Nigeria 2019 Grand Finale. Billed for December 8 in Lekki, the pageant’s Masterclass Session will be held Lagos on December 5. According to British Nigerian organiser of the beauty pageant, Mosy O’Ginni, the choice of Helen Prest-Ajayi as the Masterclass Guest Speaker is as a result of her antecedents. “Miss Hotlegs Nigeria has always attracted the movers and shakers of the entertainment industry. This year’s event is the fairytale edition, which promises to be a fun-filled evening packed with good music, comedy and lots of side attractions. And we know that the best way to kick start such a highbrow pageant is a Masterclass adorned with the personality of a well acclaimed former beauty queen, which Helen Prest-Ajayi perfectly fits into,” Mosy O’Ginny said. Born in Lagos in 1959, Prest-Ajayi is a graduate of the Universities of Ife (OAU) Ile-Ife and Kings College (London) where she obtained L.L.B and L.L.M degrees respectively. For over three decades, she has lent her name, time, energy and presence to a large number of charitable causes among, which is the Sickle Cell Foundation of Nigeria and Partners for Excellence in Education (PEEL) in which she serves as a trustee.
