A Catholic Priest in Gboko Local Government Area of Benue State, Rev. Fr. Emmanuel Asue has embarked on the rehabilitation of a 10 kilometre Trunk A road linking Ameladu-Mkar-Akaajime and Kontien communities in the local government.  Fr. Asue, who has been performing healing masses at Bua Ameladu for over 10 years now, had embarked on yearly rehabilitation of the road about five years ago using his personal resources.  Speaking with our correspondent, Fr. Asue said the exercise became imperative considering the bad nature of the road.  He said the rehabilitation of the road would boost transportation, agricultural activities and improve on the standard of living of the people of the area and those plying it.  The Catholic priest said, the rehabilitation of the road was part of his responsibility in order to give smooth transportation to the sick people attending the healing mass and complement government efforts in improving on the agricultural, socio-economic activities in the state.
