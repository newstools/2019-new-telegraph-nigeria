The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State, Chief David Lyon, has promised to develop adequate waterways security in a bid to boost the tourism potentials of coastal communities in Brass Local Government Council of the State. The APC governorship also promised to design sustainable women and youth development and empowerment programmes aimed at reducing the rising wave of poverty, unemployment and crime in the state, if he is elected as governor in the forthcoming November 16 election. Lyon made these promises yesterday during the APC governorship campaign rally in Okpoama Town, the country home of former governor and Minister of State for Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva. He said the people of the area have no reason to experience poverty and underdevelopment, if the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) government made the right investment with crude oil gas proceeds that accrued to the state in the past eight years. Addressing the large crowd of elders, women and youths that received him at the Okpo Square in Okpoama, Lyon accused the PDP of stock piling public funds in Government House with the intention to buy votes on the day of the election because they have lost the trust of the people. The APC candidate who expressed disappointment with the lack of access road to Brass, potable water and the devastating problem of insecurity, promised to engage traditional rulers, technocrats and other well-meaning Bayelsans to change the face of the oil and gas rich Brass Island.
