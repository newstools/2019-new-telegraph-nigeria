The head of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Ministerial Task Team, Mr. Ikharo Attah and his team, yesterday escaped death by the whiskers, when hoodlums attacked them at Nyanya, damaging both side and front windscreens of the team’s official vehicle.  Trouble started for the team after they stormed an illegal tricycle (Keke) park to clear a makeshift workshop at the Nyanya bridge interchange, said to have become an abode for drug peddlers and other criminal elements, while it also obstructs traffic flow.    The hoodlums who were irked after watching helplessly their dismantled kiosk and other materials being consumed by fire ignited by the task force team, quickly resorted to throwing stones at the team. Some of the hoodlums who managed to run away from the scene due to the effect of the tear gas from the police, later regrouped and targeted the chairman’s official vehicle, without knowing that the chairman had escaped in another vehicle.  Attah, who expressed concern over the violence act by the people, said the Traffic Free Flow Task Team won’t be deterred by the development, but will continue to discharge its ministerial duties.   He noted that the illegal occupants of the park were given twoweek notice to remove their properties and vacate the place, but refused to heed the warning. Attah vowed that despite the attacks, the team would continue to clear all obstructions from all the roads within the territory in accordance with the Ministerial directives and extant laws.  “We were attacked by the people after clearing the illegal park at the green belt of the Nyanya bridge interchange.
