A member of the House of Representatives representing Ikwuano/ Umuahia North/South Federal Constituency of Abia State, Samuel Onuigbo, has commended the Appeal Court for its ruling, describing the case against him as a form of distraction.   The lawmaker’s reaction was consequent upon the ruling of the Court of Appeal sitting in Owerri, which yesterday re-affirmed his election as the member representing Ikwuano/Umuahia North/ South Federal Constituency.  He recalled that the Election Petitions Tribunal had also affirmed the legitimacy of my victory. In a statement yesterday, Onuigbo, who was chairman of the House of Representatives committee on climate change in the 8th Assembly, said ‘‘while I saw the many legal tussles initiated to try and steal my victory as mere distractions considering the resounding way my people voted for me, at no point in time did I ever let my foot off the gas in my commitment to delivering unparalleled representation to the great people of Ikwuano/Umuahia North/South” According to him, “If anything, I became more vocal and more relentless in the pursuit of everything good for my people.   It is this remarkable and in-built burning desire for selfless and result- oriented service that the people of our constituency saw in me, and largely agreed that I should be re-elected to represent them for a second time.”
