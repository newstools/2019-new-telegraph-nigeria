    Governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), have disassociated themselves from a press statement circulated by the Director-General of the Progressive Governors Forum, Mr. Saliu Lukman on Wednesday in Abuja, asking the APC National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshimhole to call the party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting or resign. Findings revealed that the said statement did not emanate from the Progressive Governors Forum. At best, according to a reliable source close to one of the governors, “the Director General is on his own sponsored errand”. It was also discovered that, so far, there has been no meeting of the Progressives Governors Forum or that of the Forum’s executives to deliberate on current issues that could have warranted such volatile statement credited to the Director-General of the forum. It would be recalled that on Wednesday, the APC National Vice Chairman (South-South), Hilliard Eta, dismissed Lukman’s statement, saying the Director General was “speaking for himself”. Also confirming the disassociation of the APC governors from Lukman’s statement, the Publicity Secretary of APC Caretaker Committee in Ogun State, Mr. Tunde Oladunjoye, when contacted, disclosed that neither the Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, not the party at the state, were part of such demand. “I am sure that our Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, was not part of such demand and could not have been part of it. Apart from the fact that the Progressive Governors Forum has not met to deliberate on such issues, there are laid down rules and procedures for calling the National Executive Council (NEC) Meeting of the party,” he said.
