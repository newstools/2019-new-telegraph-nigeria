 A Catholic Priest in Gboko Local Government Area of Benue State, Rev. Fr. Emmanuel Asue, has embarked on the rehabilitation of 10 kilometre Trunk A Road, linking Ameladu-Mkar-Akaajime and Kontien communities in the local government. Asue, who has been performing Healing Masses at Bua Ameladu for over 10 years, embarked on a yearly rehabilitation of the road five years ago and had been using his personal resources. Asue explained that the exercise became imperative considering the bad nature of the road.   He noted that the rehabilitation of the road would boost transportation system, agricultural activities and improve the living standard of the people using the road. The priest said that the rehabilitation of the road was part of his responsibility in order to aid smooth transportation of sick people attending the Healing Mass and complement government efforts in improving socio-economic activities in the state.   When our correspondent visited the site, many youths were seen offering direct labour services and the Priest was also seen, instructing truck drivers and graders on what to do. Some community leaders, Mr Tyover Akaajime, Smith Takema, Mrs Mercy Shija and officials of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), all commended Asue for his efforts.
