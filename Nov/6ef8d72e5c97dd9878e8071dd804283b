Activists have just stormed the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Secretariat, Abuja armed with a petition to the National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus against the governors of Cross Rivers and Akwa Ibom states to demand action on the detained journalist Agba Jalingo and a banker, Micheal Itok respectively. The group said that PDP, as the main opposition party in Nigeria that have been at the fore front of criticizing President Muhammadu Buhari’s dictatorial policies, cannot allow the governors in its fold to detain citizens against the provisions of the constitution. Leaders of the group, Deji Adeyanju, Ariyo-Dare Atoye and Rapheal Adebayo urged the PDP’s National Headquarters to prevail on these governors to allow the law of the land take its course on the detained citizens. “It is unfortunate that as the leading opposition party which regularly condemns the lawlessness of the ruling party at the centre, some of your governors, specifically Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State and Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State, have chosen the odious path of intolerance while embarking on coercive campaigns of arrest and arbitrary detention of social critics and political activists, perceived as enemies for being critical of their governments. “Mr. Agba Jalingo, a journalist who was arrested, kept incommunicado for weeks, and is now being prosecuted in handcuffs on charges of treasonable felony, terrorism and attempt to topple the Cross River State Government, after 34 days in police custody; because he published a report exposing how Governor Ben Ayade approved and immediately diverted N500million meant for Cross River State Microfinance Bank. “Again, Mr. Michael Itok, a 21-year-old bank marketer with Prudential Microfinance Bank, Uyo, has been arrested and remanded in prison custody for weeks on the order of Governor Udom Emmanuel for allegedly publishing ‘damaging and annoying’ articles on Facebook against the governor,” the petition reads.
