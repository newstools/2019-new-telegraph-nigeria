Kano State might commence full payment of the N30,000 new minimum wage soon as  the state has set up a technical committee to look into the implementation of the new salary regime. The technical committee is given the mandate to review the federal government circular on the full implementation of the new minimum wage before the end of the year, 2019. Speaking yesterday, the state chairman of the National Public Service Negotiation Council, Kano state chapter, Comrade Hashim A. Saleh, said that the state government through the office of the Head of Civil Service (HOS) has set up a nine-member technical committee with a mandate to come up with achievable ways of implementing the new wages. He said this is sequel to the state government receipt of a circular from the federal government over the new salary structure and members of technical committee have been drawn from various groups including representatives of the Nigerian Labour Congress, Joint Trade Congress, Joint Negotiation Committee, among others, to resolve the final recommendation. Comrade Hashim said the instruction given to them from the federal government circular is to complete all the arrangements for the payment of the new scale before the end of the year 2019. “The technical committee sat for two times and they were given the mandate of two weeks to submit their report. I can assure you that the report will soon be ready for the immediate implementation of the scale and I believe that Kano workers will soon smile”.
