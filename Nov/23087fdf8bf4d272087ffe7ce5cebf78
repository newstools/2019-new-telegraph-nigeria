Ellen DeGeneres will be honored by the legacy of another very funny woman when she receives the Carol Burnett Award at this year’s Golden Globe Awards. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association tapped DeGeneres as the award’s second winner — the first being its trailblazing namesake, who accepted the prize in 2018, reports abcnews. In a statement, the organisation called DeGeneres a “pioneer who has captivated audiences for nearly 25 years with her undeniable charm and wit.” The HFPA adds the trophy will honor DeGeneres as, “an advocate and philanthropist, lending her voice to those who don’t have one, and spreading kindness and joy through the power of her platform.” DeGeneres made history with a groundbreaking 1997 episode of her sitcom “Ellen” in which her TV character — and DeGeneres herself — declared that she’s gay. The episode attracted 46 million viewers and earned DeGeneres an Emmy. When her sitcom ended, DeGeneres pivoted to talk TV. “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” is currently in its 17th season, earning some 63 Daytime Emmy Awards, a record 11 of which are for Outstanding Daytime Talk Show. Ellen will accept the Carol Burnett Award at the 77th annual Golden Globe Awards on Sunday, January 5, 2020.
