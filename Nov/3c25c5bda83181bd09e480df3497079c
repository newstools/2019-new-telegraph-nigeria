 H undreds of women in Agasha in Guma Local Government area of Benue State, yesterday, took to the streets, protesting increasing cases of mysterious disappearance of both the male and the female sex organs. It was gathered that the disappearance of human sex organs had become a recurring decimal in the local government since the beginning of November.  A concerned citizen, who identified himself as Donald revealed that no fewer than 15 people, both males and females were reported to have fallen victims to the ugly incident. He said: “Some of the victims have been moved to a priest in Ameladu, a village near Gboko Local Government Area for healing. Since sex organs disappearance continued, the community leaders have reported the case to the police. I think the women decided to make their grievance known to the public which warranted the protest.”   Meanwhile, the police command in the state has denied the report of missing sex organs.   The Benue State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), Catherine Anene, said that there was no incident of such in the community.   Anene stated that the command actually received a report from the community on the alleged disappearance of sex organs, but added that no one in the community could show evidence that his or her organ disappeared.  Anene said: “There is nothing like sex organ disappearance in the community. We received a report from the community pertaining to sex organs disappearance last Saturday. Immediately, the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in Guma visited the community the same Saturday and on Monday, with the aim of taking the victims for medical examination but no one came out. There is nothing like organ disappearance in the community.” When asked if she had received information that people were protesting in the community, the PPRO said that such information had not got to the command.
