Ebonyi State government yesterday said it had confiscated foreign rice loaded in two trailers smuggled into the state. The administration of Governor Dave Umahi had banned consumption of foreign rice when it came on board and immediately inaugurated a task force to monitor the influx of the commodity in the state. Yesterday, the task force, known as Neighbourhood Watch, intercepted foreign rice loaded in two trailers smuggled into the state. The trailers were intercepted by members of Neighbourhood Watch on duty at Afikpo Beach and were taken to the Ministry of Internal Security and Border Peace. Afikpo Beach connects Ebonyi and Cross River as well as Cameroon. The Commissioner for Internal Security and Border Peace, Stanley Emegha, told journalists that one of the trailers was loaded with rice and empty cartons of beer for easy smuggling of the commodity into the state. He said: “Some people may not be seeing the security implication of importing rice into the state. The implication is that some people use this avenue to smuggle in arms. If you watch, they go by night and when you search the things in the truck you will discover arms hidden under the bags of foreign rice. “Hoodlums cannot operate without arms, and they carry more sophisticated weapons compared to what our security men are carrying. Most of these arms are smuggled in through this means.” Emegha noted that apart from the security threats the importation of foreign rice posed, it also had health implication, as the rice was preserved with chemicals not good for human consumption. The commissioner explained that Ebonyi State was capable of producing rice that would feed the nation as it was presently ranked third best rice producing state. He said that four persons were arrested and remanded by the police for rice smuggling.
