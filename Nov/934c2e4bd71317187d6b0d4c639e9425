At least 30 suspected Boko Haram Terrorists (BHTs) operating in the fringes of Sambisa Forest in Borno State, have been killed in air operations. The operation by the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) component of Operation Lafiya Dole was conducted on Wednesday. Director of Public Relations and Information (DOPRI), Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, who made the disclosure in a statement yesterday, said the operation was occasioned by intelligence reports indicating the presence of the terrorist elements within the location. According to the DOPRI, the intelligence, surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission, had revealed the presence of some 30 enemies of state at the location. He explained that some of the suspects, who fled the location, after the targeted hit, were later neutralised. “In continuation of the sustained offensive air operations against Boko Haram Terrorist (BHT) elements in Borno State, the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation Lafiya Dole, yesterday neutralized several terrorists at their hideout in Ngoske on the fringes of the Sambisa Forest,” Daramola said. According to him: “The operation was conducted pursuant to credible intelligence reports indicating that the settlement was one of the locations being used by the BHTs as a staging area from where they launch attacks against troops positions in the southern part of the State. Accordingly, the ATF detailed its aircraft to attack the location. “Overhead the target area, 30 terrorists were spotted near a large building, surrounded by other smaller structures. The location was subsequently engaged by the attack aircraft, destroying some of the structures and neutralizing some BHTs. Other terrorists, who attempted to flee the location in disarray, were mopped-up in follow-on attacks by the jets. The NAF, operating in concert with surface forces, will sustain its efforts to completely destroy all remnants of the terrorists in the Northeast.”
