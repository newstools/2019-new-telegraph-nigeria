Foremost philanthropist and co-founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, has reclaimed his title as the world’s richest man. The latest Bloomberg Billionaires Index said Gates, 64, now has $110 billion, deposing Amazon billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, into second place at $109 billion. Bernard Arnault of Louis Vuitton luxury brand came third at $103 billion while Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg was fifth at $74.5 billion. Gates’ income was propelled by his Microsoft stocks, which went up 48 per cent in 2019. The company also secured a $10 billion defence contract for cloud infrastructure from the United States government. But Bezos’ Amazon posted a lacklustre result in the third quarter of 2019, which saw the founder lose nearly $7 billion in his stock value, reports said. Bezos had ended Gates’ 24-year run as the richest man in 2018 when he was reportedly worth $160 billion. The Amazon founder also had an infamous divorce that was finalised earlier this year, which saw his then wife, MacKenzie Bezos, walk away with $36 billion from Bezos’ stocks. It was reported as the biggest divorce settlement in history.
