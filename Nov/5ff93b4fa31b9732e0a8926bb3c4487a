Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN) has strongly condemned the recommendation of death penalty for hate speech offenders and for any offences for that matter in Nigeria, saying it is not acceptable.
He said: “How can somebody steal N10,000 and be sentenced to death, when another person who stole or embezzled N1m is allowed to go scot free.
“When I was President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), I spoke vehemently against capital punishment, I opposed it, now I will be a torn coat as governor to endorse death penalty for hate speech offenders or for any other of fence.
“As governor, I will never sign any death warrant for anybody, what I can only do is to commute the sentence to life imprisonment or I leave the decision for the governor that comes after me.”
Akeredolu, who delivered the keynote address at the 6th Biennial International Conference organised by the Center for Peace and Strategic Studies, University of Ilorin, on Monday, noted that the nature of emergence and structure of modern states in post colonial states, especially in Africa, was the fundamental reason for the myriad of crises among the people brought together by colonial fiat, making the quest for peace and progress elusive in most developing countries, including Nigeria.
