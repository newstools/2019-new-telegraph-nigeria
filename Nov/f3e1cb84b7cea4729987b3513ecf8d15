…Says no plan to impose levies on religious bodies Concerned by the reports of frequent closure of mosques and churches in recent times, the Lagos State Government on Tuesday held an emergency stakeholders’ meeting with the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC), saying no doctrine encourages noise pollution.  The government said that noise pollution is antithetical to smart city and that the dream of developing a 21st century Lagos cannot be achieved in a noisy state where lawlessness in religious practices is allowed to sway.  Hence, the government said that to achieve peaceful coexistence among the adherents of various religions in the state, certain guidelines must be followed and practiced. It added that the religious leaders through the state’s Ministry of Home Affairs will collaborate with the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources through the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LASEPA) on the eradication of noise pollution.  At meeting, the religious leaders expressed concern over frequent clamp down on their religious centres, saying that the inter-religious body deserved to be carried along in the enforcement of the noise pollution law.  At the meeting, mosques were allowed to make use of their speakers only for call to prayers but not for other religious activities, the churches were also urged to minimize noise generation level during services and control noise generation during night vigils and other activities.  Speaking on the highlights of the decision reached after the meeting, the state’s Commissioner for Home Affairs, Mrs Uzamot Akinbile-Yusuff said that the stakeholders have agreed to have a data base for religious bodies for ease of reference and communication purposes.
