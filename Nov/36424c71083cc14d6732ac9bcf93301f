 A new study by Adobe shows that while an increasing number of consumers are using mobile banking, the vast majority still consider branch locations an important part of their banking experience.  The study of 1,000 consumers across multiple age groups shows that 89 per cent of them use their bank’s web/mobile options, with 67 per cent using online options to check their account balances, and 52 per cent going online to conduct the majority of their banking transactions.   Despite that high percentage of online banking customers, 75 per cent of consumers surveyed still believe physical bank branches matter and 70% per cent of consumers have still visited a branch location in the past month.   “We’re finding that consumers are increasingly engaging with their banks online, especially for quick transactions like checking balances, but banks are just scratching the surface,” Craig Peasley, director of marketing at Adobe, said in a press release; “the data shows that there’s still room to delight customers with offerings that combine the face-to-face service that’s still popular and digital offerings.”   The remaining survey results bear out that above mentioned window of opportunity. The study shows 62 per cent of consumers say their bank’s digital offerings are just above average, compared with the rest of their digital experiences.   The study showed that 76 per cent cited security and privacy as key considerations when digitally enrolling in a bank, while 50 per cent  of respondents said they worry about the safety of their finances when using a digital-only bank.
