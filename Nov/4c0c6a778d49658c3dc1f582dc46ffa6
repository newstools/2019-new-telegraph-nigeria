A High Court sitting in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital has refused an oral application brought by a former member of the state House of Assembly, Muhammed Adebayo, seeking to terminate the criminal charge brought against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). It would be recalled that the Ilorin Zonal Office of the Commission had on August 1 arraigned Adebayo on a six-count charge bordering on land fraud and obtaining money under false pretence before Justice Sikiru Oyinloye of the state High Court. The charge stated: “That you, Mohammed Adebayo, sometime in July 2013 in Ilorin within the jurisdiction of this honourable court with intent to  defraud and obtained the sum of N950,000 from one Mary Omowunmi Kolade on the false pretence that three plots of land (situate at Malete, Moro Local Government Area of Kwara State) which  you sold to her belonged to you, a representation you knew to be false punishable under section 1 of the Advance Fee Fraud and other fraud related offences.” The accused person had pleaded not guilty to the charges. At the resumed hearing of the matter on Wednesday, counsel to the defendant, Barrister I. Abdul-Azeez, told the Presiding Judge that: “My Lord, the victim in this matter had written a letter to the prosecution to withdraw their complaints against the defendant, in the light of the absence of the prosecution counsel. I therefore urge this honourable court to terminate the charge.”
