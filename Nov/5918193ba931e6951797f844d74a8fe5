R aheem Sterling admitted “emotions got the better of me” after being dropped for England’s Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro following a clash with team-mate Joe Gomez.   The Football Association said Sterling had been dropped “as a result of a disturbance in a private team area”.   The Manchester City forward, 24, then took to social media to confirm “a five to 10 second thing” with Liverpool’s Joe Gomez, 22, in the England camp.   But he added the pair were now “good”.   Sterling and Gomez had an on-field argument during the Reds’ 3-1 Premier League victory at Anfield on Sunday.  “Both Joe and I have had words and figured things out and moved on,” Sterling said via his Instagram account on Tuesday.  “We are in a sport where emotions run high and I am man enough to admit when emotions got the better of me.  “This is why we play this sport because of our love for it – me and Joe Gomez are good, we both understand it was a five to 10 second thing… it’s done, we move forward and not make this bigger than it is.”   “Let’s get focus on our game on Thursday,” Sterling added.
