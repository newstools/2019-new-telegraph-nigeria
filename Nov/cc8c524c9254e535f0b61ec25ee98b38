  Proposes tax to fight scourge    A Professor of Medical Parasitology, Abimbola Amoo, has said Nigeria will require the sum of N420billion to eradicate malaria through total fumigation of the country against mosquitoes on or before the year 2030. To this end, Amoo, who is a senior lecturer at the Olabisi Onabanjo University (OOU), Ago-Iwoye, Ogun State, called for the introduction of Mosquito Responsibility Tax to raise the needed funds. Speaking while delivering the 92nd inaugural lecture of the university in Ago-Iwoye, the don said the proposed tax of one dollar monthly should be imposed on every adult Nigerian. The lecture was titled: ‘Parasites of animals and man: A dance in the forest of death.” Amoo explained that the money will be used in surveillance, biological and chemical control of mosquitoes as well as for inter-agency cooperation and research on mosquitoes. According to him, the scourge of malaria caused by parasite from the female anopheles mosquito is a huge health burden in Nigeria. He stated that malaria has often been responsible for the increasing hospital visits, hospital admission, anaemia during pregnancy, school absenteeism among children and even deaths. The professor noted that the treatment of people with malaria and use of insecticide treated mosquito nets have proved inadequate and ineffective in eradicating malaria, hence the need to attack the vector (causative organism) by destruction of mosquitoes.
