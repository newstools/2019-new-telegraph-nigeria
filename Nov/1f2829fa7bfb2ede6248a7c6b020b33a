The All Progressives Congress (APC) has read the riot act, stating that it would expel any member seeking a third term for President Muhammadu Buhari.
The party’s warning came as it denied the membership of one Charles Enya, who is in court seeking for the amendment of the constitution to provide for third term for President Buhari and other governors.
However, the President had last week stated categorically that he is too old to seek for third term and beside he would abide the constitution of Nigeria that stipulates two term for his office.
APC, in a statement from its National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, reacting to litigation seeking for third term for President Buhari said: “The All Progressives Congress (APC) has read in the media about a purported legal action taken by a self-proclaimed member of the Party, Charles Enya, seeking an amendment of the constitution to allow President Muhammadu Buhari run for a third term in office.
“The Party had initially chosen to ignore him. However, it has become important to send a clear message to him and such other agents provocateurs.
“At the last National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the Party, President Buhari didn’t mince words and he is not the type that talks tongue-in-cheek. He pointedly said he would abide by the constitution and uphold the oath of office he took, swearing by the holy book he believes in. This he said was besides his advanced age which made such an idea beyond his contemplation.
“The NEC meeting highlights released to the media by the party equally quoted the President admonishing APC members, leaders and elected officials to reposition themselves in their respective constituencies so as to sustain the administration’s landmark legacies beyond 2023 when the President’s constitutionally permitted terms end.”
