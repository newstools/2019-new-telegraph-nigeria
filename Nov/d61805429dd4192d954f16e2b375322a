R ivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike has declared that he remained Rivers State Governor because of the intervention of God who dislodged forces of darkness primed to rob the Rivers mandate on March 9, 2019.  Speaking during the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) Holy Ghost Rally at the Adokiye Amiesimaka yesterday, Governor Wike described himself as a living testimony of God’s blessing.  He said: “Nigerians are aware of what happened on 9th March, 2019. If anyone says he does not believe in God that event of March 9 should make you believe God.  “But for God, the enemies would have taken over the state. I thank the Church for standing firm.  They prayed for God’s will to be done and God’s will was done.  But for your prayers, I won’t be here as Rivers State Governor.  “Anytime I have the opportunity, I repeat the declaration with authority and I owe nobody an apology. I am standing on solid Authority. Rivers State is a Christian State.  “If we have all churches embark on sanitation, our state will be cleaner.  We will support this programme financially and we shall donate three vehicles to the Church for the programme.”  Wike, however, said that God had used the General Overseer of RCCG to bless Rivers State.  He said that the Annual Holy Ghost Rally had been a blessing to the State.  General Overseer of Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye said everyone needed help, saying that the best source to get help was from God.  He said: “No matter how influential and powerful, everyone needs help. Everyone needs help and the best help you can get is from the Almighty God.”
