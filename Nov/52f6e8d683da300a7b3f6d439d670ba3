The Court of Appeal Abuja Division Thursday dismissed the appeal filed by the defeated candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Emmanuel Jime and upheld the re-election of Governor Samuel Ortom Governor of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the second term. Jime had approached the court to nullify and set aside the judgment of the Benue State Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal which on October 7 upheld the victory of Governor Ortom in the March governorship election in the state. He alleged that the election was characterised by over-voting, did not comply with the provisions of the Electoral Act and as such should be nullified and be declared rightful winner of the same election. However, delivering judgement, Justice F. D Oho dismissed Jime’s appeal for lacking in merit and awarded a cost of N150, 000 to be paid to each of the respondents in the suit. The five-man panel unanimously resolved all the five issues formulated in the appeal against Jime and the APC, and agreed with the respondents’ counsels that the appeal lacks merit. The panel also dismissed the cross appeal filed by second and third respondents in the appeal and awarded cost of N250, 000 against the cross appellants. But miffed by the outcome of the case, Emmanuel Jime Thursday told his supporters he will proceed to the Supreme Court to continue with his fight.
