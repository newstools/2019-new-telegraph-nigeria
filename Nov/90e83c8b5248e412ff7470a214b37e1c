Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, has stated that the area giving him sleepless nights in his team is the defence. Rohr however expressed delight with the recent form of his strikers in their first two matches of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, as he believes scoring six goals in two matches is not a mean feat for the youthful squad. The German coach admitted that the defence was the missing link during the team’s 2-1 and 4-2 defeat of Republic of Benin and Lesotho respectively but he was quick to add that he and his assistants in the technical crew would work on all loopholes to avoid errors noted in the future. He expressed satisfaction with his strikers which he said scored six goals in the two AFCON qualifiers. “I am satisfied with what we did against Benin and Lesotho. We scored six goals in two matches, and we won them both; which is a good achievement. However, we made some mistakes, which allowed the opponents to score, but we will work on those errors and get better,” Rohr told journalists before jetting out of the country for holiday. The tactician reckoned that it would be better for the team’s stability if the defenders did not concede goals the way they did in Uyo and Maseru. Although Rohr did not mention any particular striker that awed him during both matches, the 66 year old sweat merchant pointed out further that the Eagles’ attack could hold its own against any team in the world presently.
