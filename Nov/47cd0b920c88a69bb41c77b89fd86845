President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in Bayelsa State, David Lyon, on his “impressive victory”. He felicitated with the governor-elect in a statement on Monday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina. The President also commended APC supporters in particular and Nigerians in general in Bayelsa who exercised their civic rights in a peaceful manner, despite the pockets of unrest recorded in some parts of the state. He, however, condemned the loss of lives in the state, particularly prior to the election and, commiserated with the families of the victims. “Violence during elections vitiates our commitment to demonstrate to the world and upcoming generation that we are a people capable of electing leaders in a peaceful and orderly manner,” President Buhari was quoted as saying in the statement. He noted that officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies did their best within the ambit of the law to ensure free, fair and credible elections. According to the President, it is unfortunate that pockets of unrest, mostly sponsored by desperate politicians were recorded during the poll. He promised to work with the incoming government to improve the lives of the people in Bayelsa while ensuring the security of lives and property of all citizens. Buhari also urged the governor-elect to carry other divergent interests along in the next phase of governance. He appealed to those aggrieved by the outcome of the election to seek redress through the constitutionally established channels.
