He warned that arrangement had been made to ensure that those caught will be arrested and prosecuted in line with relevant laws of Lagos State as security  personnel have been contacted to carry out  such directives. The Director-General, who affirmed the commitment of Governor Babajide Sanwo-olu led administration to safety of lives and property of its citizenry, advised members of the public to disregard any illegal purported summons, abatement notices, seal orders and so on.
