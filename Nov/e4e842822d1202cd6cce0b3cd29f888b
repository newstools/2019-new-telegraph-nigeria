Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has advocated adequate preparation for Nigeria to survive in the post-oil years which he said could be nearer than expected. He has therefore called for better attention to technical education, agriculture and enterprise.
“The whole world is preparing for post-oil years and this means we must consciously wean ourselves off the unhelpful addiction to the oil wealth. We must promote skills acquisition, agribusiness, and enterprise,” AbdulRazaq said on Thursday at the 26th Convocation Ceremony of the Kwara State Polytechnic in Ilorin, the state capital.
The governor was represented at the event by the Secretary to the State Government, Prof Mamman Saba Jibril.
He described as lacking depth earlier suggestions that Nigeria should scrap Polytechnic education, saying that the coming post oil years open the window for institutions offering technical education to redirect the country to the path of sustainable growth and self reliance.
“Kwara under us will promote agribusiness, skills acquisition, private initiatives and local technological inventions,” he said.
Speaking earlier at the official swearing in of the NYSC 2019 Batch C (Stream I) Orientation Course in Yikpata in Edu Local Government Area of the State, AbdulRazaq called on the youth corps members to ensure adherence to rules at the camp and pay good attention to all the entrepreneurial trainings being offered.
Represented by Deputy Governor Kayode Alabi, the governor also urged them to reflect over the objectives of the mandatory one year national service which began some 46 years ago.
