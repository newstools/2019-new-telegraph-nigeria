    The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has begun distribution of sensitive materials to various Registration Area Centres (RACs) in Bayelsa State ahead of Saturday’s governorship poll taking place in the state. At the Central Bank in Yenagoa, the venue of the distribution, INEC officials, party agents, both national and international Observers were all at the vicinity. The Resident Electoral Commission (REC), Monday Udoh told journalists that INEC was 100 per cent ready to conduct credible elections for the people. “We are here to observe and monitor the movement of the materials. The sensitive materials are ballot papers and result sheets and Card Readers. “The distribution is moving smoothly, the security agents are here and National Union of Road Transporter Workers (NURTW) is also with us. The police have deployed many of their men for this distribution and the election proper.” On the court granting the All Progressives Congress (APC) stay of execution to participate in the contest, the REC said, he was not the court but all political parties will participate. “For now, all the political parties are participating unless there is a specific court order – then we can disqualify the affected party,” Udoh explained.
