The biggest iPhone ever is coming next year, a report out of Asia claims. Apple’s 2020 lineup will top out with an iPhone whose screen measures 6.7 inches diagonally, according to Korean news site ETNews. That’s only about an inch less than the display of Apple’s iPad Mini, which measures 7.9 inches. The iPhone 11 Pro Max, for comparison, has a 6.5-inch display, reports the New York Post. On the smaller end of the spectrum, the report said Apple will put out a 5.4-inch iPhone next year as well, which is smaller than the smaller iPhone 11 Pro’s 5.8-inch OLED display. Samsung will manufacture the OLED displays for both models, ETNews says, noting that Chinese OLED production capabilities have yet to catch up to South Korea’s. Apple will, however, keep a 6.1-inch model in its roster, a size that has proven popular with iPhone 11 buyers. The 6.1-inch phone will receive a screen quality upgrade, according to the report, with LG supplying OLED displays for the handset. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company typically announces its new phones at a September event in the Bay Area. Last month, high-profile Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported that the company was eyeing a first quarter 2020 launch for a low-priced iPhone SE2 that could sell for as low as $399. Shares of Apple were up 0.8 percent Wednesday afternoon, at $266.46.
