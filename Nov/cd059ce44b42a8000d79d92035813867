Researchers in the United States (US) have found that residential greenness could protect against premature all-cause mortality. Findings of the new study, which was published in the journal ‘The Lancet Planetary Health,’ provided strong evidence on the impact of increasing green areas on mortality. The longitudinal study involving seven countries and over eight million people, is a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) in collaboration with Colorado State University and the World Health Organisation (WHO). The seven different countries involved in the study are Canada, United States, Spain, Italy, Australia, Switzerland and China). Many previous studies suggested that green spaces in cities have positive health effect, including less stress, improved mental health, and lower risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and premature death, among others. The team found that an increment in greenness around homes was significantly associated with reduced premature mortality. More specifically, the study provided an estimate for the protective effect: a four per cent reduction in premature mortality per each increment of 0.1 in vegetation score within 500 meters of the residence, the ‘Medical Express’ reported.
