As the Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, unveiled the state’s 2020 budget today at the state House of Assembly, New Telegraph gathered last night that the governor has placed a priority on education and health in the budget, thereby increasing allocations to the two sectors. The size of the budget was not immediately clear last night, but sources close to the government said it will be bigger than last year’s N1.046 trillion. According to the sources, the budget will give top priority to Education and Health. It was also not clear how much will be spent on the two sectors, but it is believed that the allocation to health will be almost double of last year’s N29.9 billion. “It will be over N30 billion,” an official said, pleading not to be named because “it is out of place to divulge details of the budget before they are released”. Another source who also pleaded not to be named, said education will have a big chunk of the sectoral allocations. He said the education vote will be “almost double of last year’s vote at over N40 billion,” he added. Sanwo-Olu is said to have made the sectoral allocations in a “bold” bid to fulfill his campaign promises and emphasise the point that “it is not all about bricks and mortars; development should focus on human beings.”
