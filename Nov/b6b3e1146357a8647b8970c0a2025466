The Duke (Enogie) of Ogan community in Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo State, HRH George Igbinovia, has abandoned his palace and fled his community following mayhem that engulfed the area. Irate youths of the community had wanted to lynch the top chief over a feud between members of the same family. About nine buildings and vehicles were razed in the wake of the mayhem that trailed the community on Saturday last week. Hundreds of residents of the community have also fled the troubled area and are yet to return to their homes. New Telegraph learnt that the youths had chased away the Monarch after soldiers invited to the community by the Enogie and his sons shot one Agharuwa Pulley dead. The youths, according to eye witness accounts, had mobilised to the Enogie’s palace to demand for money realised from the burrow pit in the community when one of his sons drove in with armed soldiers. The soldiers were said to have shot sporadically into the air during which a bullet hit Agharuwa who died on the spot. Source close to the community said the crisis erupted over struggle to control the burrow pit between eldest son of the Enogie and his step brothers. But HRH Igbinovia told newsmen that his eldest son instigated the community against him over money realised from the burrow pit. He explained that: “They have driven me away; it is only these clothes on body that I have left. My son said I am old.” On his part, the eldest son, Prince Daniel Igbinovia, denied the allegation stressing that the boy was killed by soldiers brought by his step brothers.
