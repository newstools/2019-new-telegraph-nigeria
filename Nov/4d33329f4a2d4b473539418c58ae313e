Ebonyi State government, Monday described as untrue the existence
of Bakassi Boys security group in the state.
There were social media reports from some Biafra agitators, including
IPOB, that the state government has inaugurated Bakassi Boys security
outfit to confront the agitators.
The Biafra Restoration Voice (TBRV) had  reported that the Bakassi Boys
was inaugurated to attack members of IPOB because of their opposition
to Rural Grazing Area (RUGA) in the state and South-east in general.
But the state government described it as strange and untrue.
Speaking with reporters in Abakaliki, the state capital, the Commissioner for Internal Security and Border Peace, Chief Stanley
Okoro Emegha dismissed the insinuations and berated Biafra agitators for the rumour.
“This is a strange story as a far as the state is concerned, there is no security outfit that can be established in this state without the
knowledge of the state government and as such there is nothing like Bakassi Boys.
“There is nothing like Bakassi or ISAKABA, IPOB, MASSOB or whatever you call them. People may stay in their homes based on their agitations and say they are IPOB or MASSOB or they are this or that but they are not known in Ebonyi State because their activities are against the law of the land.”
