YIAGA AFRICA said its Parallel Vote Tabulation (PVT) methodology showed that the last Saturday’s governorship election did not hold in at least 25 percent of the polling units of Bayelsa State.
At a press statement in Abuja Monday, YIAGA AFRICA said it deployed 21 mobile observers and 500 citizen observers for its PVT to a statistical sample of 250 polling units located across all eight local government areas of Bayelsa State.
It also disclosed that eight LGA result collation observers were deployed to the LGA collation centers.
The statement, which was signed by Dr. Aisha Abdullahi and Ezenwa Nwagwu, Chair and Co-Chair respectively of YIAGA AFRICA, alleged that the collation process for the Bayelsa governorship election was manipulated, particularly for Southern Ijaw local government.
“This calls into question the official results announced by INEC and credibility of this election,” the statement added.
Although it said its PVT could not determine who has won the governorship election for Bayelsa, “regardless of the outcome, the PVT estimates suggest that the official results were manipulated during the collation process.”
