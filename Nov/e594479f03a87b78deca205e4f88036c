…Katsina Utd to compound Nasarawa Utd woes  Akwa United head coach, John Obuh, will be facing one of the biggest matches of his reign at the club when the Promise Keepers travel to Aba to battle eight-time champions of the Nigeria Professional Football League, Enyimba, in one of the MatchDay 3 games scheduled for various centres in the country this weekend. The battle of neighbours will be the second home game for the People’s Elephant who hosted Nasarawa United during the week in a rescheduled game. Enyimba are one of the two clubs from the country still playing on the continent after qualifying for the group stages of the CAF Confederation Cup. Apart from the game in Aba, Rangers, the other club still on the continent, will play host to MFM of Lagos. MFM shocked bookmakers during the Matchday 1 of the season as they defeated Heartland 1-0 in Okigwe, the home of the Naze Millionaires. They however failed to build on the victory after drawing 1-1 at home against FC IfeanyiUbah in their second game. They will however have their hands full in the game against Rangers who will have the support of their fans at the Cathedral. Two newly promoted sides, Warri Wolves and Adamawa United, will be up against each other this weekend as they both seek their first win of the season. Warri Wolves have drawn their first two games against Akwa United and Sunshine Stars while Adamawa United have drawn one while losing the other. League leaders, Plateau United, will be playing against another Northern side, Wikki Tourists, as they continue to cement their position at the top of the table. Other matches this weekend will see Delta Force taking on Jigawa Golden Stars as Heartland play against Akwa Starlets. Lobi will be away to Kano Pillars while it will be a game between FC IfeanyiUbah and Rivers United.
