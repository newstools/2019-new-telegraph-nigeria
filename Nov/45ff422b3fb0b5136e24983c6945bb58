Onyekachi Eze, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has demanded the cancellation of the result of last Saturday’s governorship election in Okene, Kogi State, alleging that the 112, 000 votes scored by the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the area was fictitious. PDP in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said there was evidence of alterations of figures to reduce its vote in the area and allocate imported figures to the APC. “Our party hopes that this apparent moves to allocate fictitious results to the APC has no bearing with the allegations in the public space that Governor Yahaya Bello and the APC had compromised highly placed INEC officials with huge sums of money to alter results in favour of the APC,” the party further stated. It maintained that nobody would accept what it described as “the provocative alteration of results from polling units as well as allocation of fictitious votes, particularly the awarding of 112, 000 votes to APC in Okene.”
