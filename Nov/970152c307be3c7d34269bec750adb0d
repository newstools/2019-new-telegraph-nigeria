Defender Joe Gomez and midfielder Jordan Henderson have pulled out of England’s squad before Sunday’s final Euro 2020 qualifier in Kosovo. Gomez, 22, picked up a knee injury in training, while Liverpool team-mate Henderson, 29, has a viral infection. Forward Raheem Sterling is available again after being dropped for the 7-0 win over Montenegrofollowing a clash with Gomez at England’s training camp, reports the BBC. Gomez was booed as he came on as a substitute at Wembley on Thursday. England manager Gareth Southgate has said he will have no hesitation in naming Manchester City’s Sterling, 24, in the starting line-up for the match in Pristina (17:00 GMT kick-off). The Three Lions have already qualified as group winners for next summer’s tournament.
