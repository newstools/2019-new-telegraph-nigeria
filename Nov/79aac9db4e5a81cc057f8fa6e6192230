…say report designed to misinform public Emmanuel Onani, Abuja There are indications that the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja did not threaten to jail the Director-General (DG) of the Department of State Services, Mr. Yusuf Bichi, contrary to reports in some sections of the media. According to the said reports, the alleged threat followed the continued detention of convener of #Revolution Now Movement, Mr. Omoyele Sowore, and an activist, Mr. Olawale Bakare, However, findings by New Telegraph showed that at no time did the court issue such a threat. Rather, the duo only instituted a contempt suit against the DSS, which had yet to be heard. This was as security officials, who pleaded anonymity, said that “the fake news is clearly designed to misinform the public”. They said that “though the writers created the impression that the court sat on Monday, November 25, 2019, the fact remains that it never did.” One of the security sources, told our correspondent that: “A senior counsel in the court disclosed that the judge did not make the misleading pronouncement reportedly carried by sections of the media.” He said: “That Sowore’s legal team filled, on November 12, 2019, Form 48, otherwise a complaint form in the court, does not suggest a committal of the DG to jail,” He went further to say that: “It should be noted that a petition for committal for contempt is not necessarily an order for contempt. It also does not amount to guilt for contempt. This is a major reason the media hype, in its entirety, should be disregarded.” Consequently, the security source condemned a situation  whereby some outfits “bought this deception and gave it undue publication without detailed investigation”.
