Arsenal Chairman Sir Chips Keswick is reportedly considering resigning from the board over Unai Emery’s continued reign at the club and feels powerless to do anything. The Gunners failed to win yet again in the Premier League on Saturday, escaping with a 2-2 draw at home to Southampton thanks to a brace from Alexandre Lacazette – though could easily have lost the match. Arsenal now sit in seventh place in the table, eight points adrift of the top-four spots, and have not won in the league since beating Bournemouth at the start of October. The pressure is now ramping up on Emery, with large sections of supporters turning on the manager and chanting for him to leave during Saturday’s clash at the Emirates. According to The Athletic, those noises were heard loud and clear in the boardroom and Sir Chips – who has been chairman since taking over from Peter Hill-Wood in 2013 – felt ‘compelled’ to consider handing in his resignation. He feels he has been frozen out from the decision-making process over Emery’s future and does not want to ‘carry the can’ for the current discontent. Technical Director Edu and Gead of Football Raul Sanllehi are the two key players in Arsenal’s hierarchy now and intend to give Emery more time before reassessing his position. Managing Director Vinai Venkatesham, Chiefnegotiator Huss Fahmy and Josh Kroenke, son of owner Stan, make up the decision-making group, with Sir Chips having been sidelined with virtually no say in Emery’s future. Should the 79-year-old, who is a lifelong Arsenal fan, walk away from the club it would end a long association with the Gunners, having first become a director back in 2005. Emery is believed to have three more Premier League games to turn Arsenal’s season around – against Norwich, Brighton and West Ham – and any further slip-ups could see him axed, particularly with north London rivals Tottenham having acted so decisively.
