The nation’s power grid experienced a total collapse twice in four hours, plunging consumers across the country into blackout. The grid, which is being managed by government-owned Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), has continued to suffer system collapse over the years amid a lack of spinning reserve that is meant to forestall such occurrences. Eko Electricity Distribution Plc, one of the nation’s distribution companies, disclosed that the grid collapsed at 11:15pm on Friday and 3:15am on Saturday. “At 2315hrs, we experienced a system collapse across all transmission stations. Supply was received at 0315hrs. Sadly, at 0438hrs, the system collapsed again. TCN and our team are working to restore supply. Kindly bear with us,” the Disco said on its Twitter handle. Another Disco, Jos Electricity Distribution Plc, announced to its customers that “there is power outage in all our franchise states due to system collapse nationwide. “We will provide an update shortly. Thank you for bearing with us,” it said on Twitter.
