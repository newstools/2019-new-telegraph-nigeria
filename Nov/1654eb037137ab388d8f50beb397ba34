Ekiti State First Lady, Erelu Bisi Fayemi, has advised parents on adequate deworming of their children in line with medical prescriptions to prevent diseases associated with worms’ infection. Fayemi made the call on Thursday in Ado-Ekiti, during the flag-off of mass deworming of schools children in the state. The flag off ceremony took place at the State Universal Basic Education (SUBEB) office complex and Okesa Health Centres in Ado-Ekiti. Fayemi noted that diseases associated with worm infections are common in places where sanitation is inadequate and water supply is poor. She urged residents to ensure they have well sanitised environment and use clean waters. Fayemi said 24 per cent of the world’s population is infected with the soil transmitted infectious diseases, particularly among school children. She said: “The symptoms of soil transmitted infestation include intestinal manifestation (diarrhoea and abdominal pains), general malaise and weakness of the body, impaired cognitive and physical development, anaemia and others. “Worm infection includes blood in urine, anaemia and cancer of the bladder. All the common worms in school age children can be treated effectively with pills. “In consequence, the Ekiti State Government has embarked on a mass deworming campaign to treat school children, age four to 15 years in Ekiti State as part of Dr Kayode Fayemi’s commitment to the health and well-being of the citizens.” Fayemi added that the governor had since the inception of the administration, demonstrated his commitment to the provision of effective health care delivery system for the people through several interventions like the free health programmes, school feeding among others. “The introduction of the school feeding programme in particular will impact positively on the mass deworming campaign.
