    Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo (Mrs) of an Ikeja Special Offences Court, Lagos Wednesday sentenced three men, who kidnapped the traditional ruler of Iba in Lagos State, Oba Goriola Oseni, to both life imprisonment and death by hanging. Justice Tawio convicted and sentenced the three men: Duba Furejo, Reuben Anthony and Yerin Fresh on a seven-count charge bordering on conspiracy, murder, attempted murder, armed robbery and kidnapping. The trio, alongside one Ododomo Isaiah (now late), abducted the 74-year-old monarch in his palace at Iba around 8pm on July 16, 2015. The convicts also shot dead two people â€“ a palace guard, Sunday Okanlawon and a commercial motorcyclist, Joseph Okeke. The prosecution team, led by the Solicitor General of Lagos State, Titilayo Shitta-Bey, said that the convicts also attempted to murder Abosede Oseni, wife of the Oba and took away her cell phone. Shitta-Bey said that the offences contravened Sections 223, 230, 297, 299, 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. According to the judgement of the court, the trio are to serve a total prison sentence of 153 years: 30 years each for conspiracy to commit murder, armed robbery and kidnapping, while 21 years each was slammed for kidnapping. The convicts were further sentenced to life imprisonment for both attempted murder and armed robbery. While pronouncing her judgement, Justice Taiwo said the defendants, who appeared to be first time offenders, clearly understood the gravity of the offences and the consequences of their actions.
