The Benue State Police Command, yesterday, confirmed that a nine-year-old, identified as Maria Abah, committed suicide at Ankpa Quarters area of Makurdi metropolis. The Benue State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), Catherine Sewuese Anene, disclosed that the girl committed the crime inside her room. Anene said the command was yet to ascertain the reason the girl decided to take her life. She said that the Command has commenced investigation to unravel the circumstances leading to the girl’s death. Anene said that the corpse of the deceased has been deposited at Bishop Murray’s Hospital Mortuary in Makurdi. The police spokesperson assured members of the public that the police would not rest on its oars until the truth about the suicide was unravelled. However, neighbours, who spoke with our correspondent, said that the deceased, who hailed from Owukpa in Ogbadibo Local Government Area of the state, was brought to Makurdi by the General Overseer of Mount Zion Ministry in Makurdi as a house-help, to a woman, who runs the church. The late Maria was staying in the same room with the General Overseer’s children, where she was found dead. It was further gathered that the deceased was allegedly accused by the other children of bed wetting on several occasions and even beaten up several times. Many people felt that the beating over bedwetting made her to take her life. When journalists visited the residence of the General Overseer of the Mount Zion Ministry church, some members of the family, declined comments. They said their mother had gone to the police headquarters to sign some documents before travelling to the village for burial.
