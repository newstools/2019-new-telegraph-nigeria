Two persons reportedly lost their lives yesterday at Aruwa village of Atakumosa Local Government Area of Osun State when northern miners and southern miners clashed in the process of extraction of gold in the local government. Eye witness account told journalists that: “The violent clash on the site among labourers claimed two lives, in which one was said to be of Northern extraction, while the other victim is a Yoruba man.  “The death of that Yoruba labourer is what is presently creating tension amongst Northerners living in Sabo area of Ile-Ife, going by their experience in 2017.  “Since many of those Northern labourers reside at Sabo, there is an apprehension that the Yorubas might want to revenge the death of their kinsman the way it happened then, which made those northerners to come out with weapons to defend themselves and their property.”
