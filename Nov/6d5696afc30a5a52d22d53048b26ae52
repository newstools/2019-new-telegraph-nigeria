A TV personality, lecturer, leadership ambassador, Prof Princess Halliday trained as a Petroleum Engineer, communications expert and an occasional actress. She has a show, The Princess Halliday Show that is on MNET and shows in 48 countries. This beautiful lady from Rivers State is one of the young promising Nigerians out there and has been a strong voice in Africa as regards women empowerment. At age 17, she founded Empower Africa Initiative, a platform that ensures African women in leadership positions are strengthened. In this interview with VANESSA OKWARA, she talks about her life and women in leadership in Africa   How has it been?  I am very well, thank you!  How seriously are women in Africa being taken in terms of leadership?  We live in a fast-changing world, especially in Africa and it has seriously affected our people. There is this mindset and value that tend to subject women to their sexuality. But we are telling people that you must stop subjecting women sexuality when it comes to leadership positions. Mine is to make sure that we change the narrative so that the woman cannot only be respected but also be at the table where decisions are made. If you are a woman, you must have experienced that in one way or the other.  What are you exactly coming back home to do in Nigeria? <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-270974" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Prof.-Princess-Halliday-Women-must-be-at-tables.png?resize=300%2C157&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="157" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Prof.-Princess-Halliday-Women-must-be-at-tables.png?resize=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Prof.-Princess-Halliday-Women-must-be-at-tables.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1"> I have some speaking engagements. But that is not all. I am also on the lookout for collaborations with some people in Lagos; we are working with them at the moment towards leadership issues. My goal is to make sure that every young person knows that there is the need to learn to be a leader. We hope to educate them on what it takes to be authentic leaders. You will believe with me that one of the biggest challenges we have as a country is leadership and so we have to start this conversation with the younger ones on what it takes to lead.  Lack of mentorship amongst young Africans has become a big problem?  I hear that and I agree with you. I also think that many young people have been wired to let things remain the way they are; they want to keep accepting the status quo. There has been no ability to challenge the status quo. We need people who will not just be subservient but challenge the status quo by asking questions. One of the major problems we have in Nigeria is that people do not even have the confidence to ask why. They think if they ask questions it means being disrespectful. No you are not. It is not disrespectful to be heard. You have to speak to power.   The elders also believe that the Nigerian youth is not ready for leadership; do you share the same opinion?  I do not completely agree with that. I think great leaders are ones who extend their cycle of influence to everyone thereby making everyone feel like they belong. Most leaders in Africa do not extend their level of influence to allow a young person to see a road map of becoming a leader. So I don’t believe that the young people do not have leadership capacity. Anybody born of a woman is supposed to be tutored on how to be a leader. Some leaders are born, but leadership can be learnt.  Are you of the opinion that we do not have good leaders in Nigeria?  I am not saying we do not have good leaders in Nigeria. I am saying that a lot more needs to be done to broaden our horizon. We have to broaden our mindset. We have to learn that as leaders, you must extend your level of influence and think of how to create the next generation of leaders. We can’t be in office forever. We have to create opportunities for other people who are qualified. There is something I usually say and that is that we have to begin to govern our nation based on meritoc racy. What can you accomplish? What do you know? Once one is evaluated and seen to have the capacity to lead, he has to be given the chance to lead. But when we wake up and assume it is not for them, it will not only affect us but our children and our children’s children; and even further generations will be affected.   What image are Nigerians getting as a people in the US, when it comes to leadership?   I cannot say that on a large scale, but I know that as an individual, wherever I am present or wherever Nigeria is mentioned, something great is seen. In America at the moment, I am recognised with what they call ‘Extraordinary Ability in Leadership’.  USA accorded me that privilege. You must be at the top of your field in leadership to be given that honour.   With your pedigree in the US, has any leader in Nigeria approached you in the hope that you could be involved in contributing your quota here?   Well, I raise my hand up all the time. When I spoke at a forum hosted by the International Monetary Fund, IMF about a year and half ago in Washington DC, I kept raising my hand. One problem we have as women is that we afraid of raising our hands. I am very quick to raise my hands. I raise my hand and I negotiate for myself.   Are there some women in Africa that are your role models?   I think that any woman that has paved the way for me to be at the table is a role model. Any woman that has done something to create a chance for another woman is a role model. There are many women who are role models in Africa. Many women are doing well.   Nigeria is blessed with both natural and human resources. Do you agree that Nigeria has not taken advantage of her human resources?   That is also true. We are very highly educated. We are qualified. But we need to start believing in ourselves. We can be that change we want to be. We can be what America is. We can be what we go to London or India to seek.  The last International Day of the Girl Child had the theme, ‘Unstoppable’. What is your advice to the girl child?   I will say to every young woman that you can be who you want to be. I tell you this totally that you have the capacity to be who you want to be and nothing can stop you. Nigerian women should begin to ask the right questions, and start challenging the status quo. They should not rely on conventional belief and systems.   What makes you proud as a Nigerian with the negative stereotype out there?   That is a tough question. I am a Nigerian. And I am proud of being a Nigerian. I know that we are working towards having a better country.   Nigeria has a rich culture especially with her music. What is it like in the United States?   Yeah, Nigerian music has grown beyond everyone’s expectations. It is hugely accepted in the US. As a matter of fact, I work out every day and when I am working out, I always have Nigerian music on my ears. After studying and teaching, working out for me is awesome and Nigerian music helps me out when I am doing so. Davido, Tiwa Savage and Wiz Kid are all exceptional.   You studied Engineering. How do you reconcile that with your job on TV and even leadership?   Yeah, I got my first degree in Petroleum Engineering and that was over a decade ago. But I did that because of my late father. When I was growing up, I was a gifted child. My father said the only way I could make him happy was to become an engineer and work with Shell. And I had to become an engineer. Unfortunately, my father did not live to see me become an engineer. I later branched off to study Communication, and later International Business, and now a PhD in Leadership.
