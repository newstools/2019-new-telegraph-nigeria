At least, 28 million Nigerians are living with the Hepatitis B virus, with more than half of the number unaware of the medical condition. A Professor of Gastroentorology/ Hepatology at the Bayero University, Kano, Adamu Alhaji Samaila, made the frightening revelation yesterday, at an awareness lecture and screening exercise for Hepatitis B virus held at headquarters of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) in Abuja. It was organised by the medical branch of the service. The lecture was approved by the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar as part of measures to ensure that hepatitis and other similar diseases do not pose a challenge to the NAF’s operational readiness. In his presentation, the guest lecturer said: “About 28 million Nigerians are suffering from Hepatitis B. Over 2 billion (global figure) individuals have evidence of previous and present infection. 240 million chronic carriers, one million deaths annually.” Accordingly, Samaila called for screening and testing, saying doing so will facilitate early detection and treatment where necessary. In his opening remarks, the CAS maintained that, beyond the deployment of platforms for battles, there was the compelling need for personnel to be mentally and physically fit. This, he noted, was due to the nature of the environment they operate. The CAS, who was represented by the Chief of Policy and Plans, Air Vice Marshal Napoleon Bali, said upon his assumption of office, he had upgraded the Directorate of Medical Services to a branch status to underscore the importance attached to mental and physical health of officers and personnel of the NAF. He said: “On assumption of office as the Chief of the Air Staff, we were faced with enormous responsibility of supporting the maintenance of peace in conflict environments both internally and externally which required a robust medical coverage for NAF personnel engaged in’ operational and supporting duties.
