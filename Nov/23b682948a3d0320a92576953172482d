The Union staffers, who are being owed cumulative 11 months’ salaries according to a statement signed by the Chairman Dr Biodun Olaniran, and Secretary Dr Toyin Abegunrin, said they might resort to strike at the expiration of the ultimatum if the university fails to pay. Resorting to the resolution arrived at after their Congress, the Union also threatened to withhold the Rain Semester results of 2018/2019 academic session until the salaries are paid. The executives said: “The Union gives the university administration till Friday, November 15 to pay the salaries of August, September and October 2019, failure of which will cause the Union to hold a Congress on Monday, November 18 where necessary action deemed fit will be taken. That, Rain Semester results of 2018/2019 academic session would not be submitted until the said salaries are paid,” it said. Meanwhile, the university’s Vice Chancellor, Professor Michael Ologunde, was said to have attributed the non-payment of the salaries to non-release of subvention to it by the owner states of Oyo and Osun
