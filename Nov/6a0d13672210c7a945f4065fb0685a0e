Researchers from the United Kingdom (UK) said vitamin D was linked with poor muscle health in older adult. These are the findings of a new study published recently in the journal ‘Clinical Interventions in Ageing’. To address the problem, study co-author, Eamon Laird, has called for the implementation of policies that could eliminate vitamin D deficiencies in the population by fortifying food with vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency can lead to a loss of bone density, which can contribute to osteoporosis and fractures (broken bones). Severe vitamin D deficiency can also lead to other diseases. In children, it can cause rickets, a rare disease that causes the bones to become soft and bend. Adults older than 65, are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiencies. People get vitamin D through food and by exposure to sunlight. In severe cases, deficiency can lead to thin, brittle or misshapen bones and Vitamin D supplementation is the main treatment. In this study, the team examined more than 4,100 people, aged 60 and older, in England. About four in 10 with vitamin D deficiency had muscle weakness — twice the level found among those who had adequate vitamin D levels. According to the findings, impaired muscle performance was three times more common among those with vitamin D deficiency (25.2 per cent) than those with adequate vitamin D (7.9 per cent). Further analysis showed that vitamin D deficiency significantly increased the odds of impaired muscle strength and performance.’ In addition, participants who got regular moderate physical activity were much less likely to have poor muscle strength and physical performance, the study showed. Alternatively, maintaining muscle health helps seniors maintain their independence, mobility and quality of life. It also lowers their risk of falls and frailty. First author, Niamh Aspell, who did her doctoral studies at Trinity, said the findings support the need for public health strategies to eliminate vitamin D deficiency in older people.
