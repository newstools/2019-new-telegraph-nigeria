The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Saturday, called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to reject results coming from Okene and Okehi Local Government Areas of the State, alleging that they have been compromised.  The party in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, accused the agents of Governor Yahaya Bello and the All Progressives Congress (APC) of threatening and forcing INEC presiding officers and members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) to endorse pre-filled results sheets in favour of the APC, in some local government areas. PDP further alleged that the governor and the APC were desperate to allocate fictitious votes and fabricate results in their favour in Okene and Okehi Local Government Areas in Kogi Central senatorial zone.  “For instance, in Kabba/ Bunu Okekoko Ward Unit 9, the baby units have been reduced from two to one, a situation that will lead to disenfranchising of voters to reduce votes belonging to the PDP. “Also the serial number on the ballot papers brought to the area is different from numbers on ballot papers released in Abuja for the area.  “Such swapping of ballot papers is a deliberate ploy to cause confusion and derail the electoral process in PDP stronghold. “INEC and security officials must take immediate steps to arrest the situation as the development is already causing tension and could lead to the electorate having no option than to resort to self-help to defend their democratic rights,” the party warned.  PDP said it would not accept manipulated results coming from Okene and Okehi local government areas. It called on security agencies to immediately detail a reinforced team to Okene and Okehi to save the lives of the presiding officers and the NYSC members from the APC and agents of Yahaya Bello.
