A nurse has been kicked out of the profession after he was jailed for 15 years for raping a patient. Mohamed Kamara, 48, pulled the curtains around the woman’s bed at Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, on May 15, 2017. He then tried to force feed her sleeping pills before sexually abusing her. Kamara had been assigned to the woman as one of a team of one-to-one mental health nurses providing 24-hour care because of the risk she posed. After being raped she suffered from PTSD, emotional unstable personality disorder and depression, reports metro.co.uk. After the rape he forced her to have a shower and changed her bedsheets in a bid to get rid of any evidence. He also threatened her to try and stop her calling police. However, the victim told her daughter and Kmaara was arrested before being jailed at Snaresbrook Crown Court in July 2018. The Nursing and Midwifery Council held a hearing where it was decided he should be struck off. Panel chairman Paul Morris said: “Mr Kamara has been convicted of raping an extremely vulnerable patient in her hospital bed. “The panel considered that not only was this a very serious criminal conviction, but that it also constituted a gross breach of trust and an abuse of his position. “It considered that, due to the very serious nature of Mr Kamara’s conviction and the surrounding circumstances, the only sanction which would adequately protect the public and satisfy the public interest is a striking-off order. “The panel decided that to take any other action in this case would undermine public confidence in the profession and the NMC as a regulatory body, and leave the public exposed to a future risk of harm. “The panel therefore decided that the appropriate and proportionate sanction is a striking-off order.”
