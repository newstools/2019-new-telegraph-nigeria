Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obas, has said the immediate past governor of the state, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, repeatedly violated the constitutional stipulation of the state’s budget law, adding that the former governor resorted to blackmail and harassment against the 8th Assembly from performing its duties.  This is just as the speaker said a cleaning company, Visionscape, engaged by the last administration, was considered a ghost by the legislature because it had no provision in the state’s budget.  Speaking in an address he read yesterday during the presentation of 2020 budget by the state Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, in the Assembly’s chamber, Obasa said matter of budget presentation was essential, adding that beyond its constitutional stipulation, it required the backing of law to make it implementable and executable; without which it became an offence punishable under the law.  Sanwo-Olu presented to the Assembly a budget estimate of N1.168 trillion to be funded through a projected total revenue of N1.071trillion. He tagged the budget: “Budget of Awakening to a Greater Lagos.”  Obasa said: “Lagos State budget has become a topical issue vis-à-vis last administration where provision of the budget law was being viciously violated. It is worthy of note that the Nigeria 1999 Constitution recognises the separation of power and empowers the state House of Assembly to dictate how the state fund was being expended and the manner of its presentation.
