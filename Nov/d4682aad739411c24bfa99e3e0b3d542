Normal health services at the Benue State University Teaching Hospital (BSUTH) have grounded to a halt following a strike embarked upon by the Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU).
The strike has crippled all activities as some patients were seen been moved out of the hospital by their relations to private hospitals to continue with their medication.
The various associations that joined the strike comprised of nurses, pharmacists, administrative officers, clerical staff, social workers, optometrics, physiotherapists, midwives, laboratory technicians and scientists.
Others are mortuary attendants, imaging scientists, drivers, engineers, plumbers, carpenters, porters, psychologists
New Telegraph learnt that medical doctors and management staff have not joined the strike.
Public Relations Officer of BSUTH, Mr. Cephas Hough, who confirmed the development, said the members of the union downed tools on Friday midnight after they closed from work.
“They went on strike last Friday midnight after they closed from work. They are demanding among other things the non implementation of their promotions and payment of their accumulated arrears,” he said.
Our correspondent, who visited the hospital Sunday for an on the spot assessment, observed that it was an eyesore at the Emergency and Intensive Care Unit (E&ICU) which was very unhygienic and emitting dangerous odour.
The situation was the same with toilets and latrines as there was virtually nobody to attend to them, while patients that had scheduled appointments with medical doctors were turned down.
