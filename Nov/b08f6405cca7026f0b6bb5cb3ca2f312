One retail mall, many      empty stores   Despite the growth in the retail sector going by the number of shopping malls adorning Nigerian cities, DAYO AYEYEMI reports that the success is gradually dwindling due to a rise in empty stores in many of the retail malls   W ith growing population of over 180 million, Nigeria offers enormous opportunities for real estate, despite structural weakness in its economy. Besides, the nation’s cities with a population of over one million people and growing middle class have presented several possible markets for investors to enter.  It wasn’t therefore a surprise when multinational investors launched the foremost Palm Shopping Mall in Victoria Island and Ikeja Shopping Mall, Lagos in 2005 and 2011 respectively recording outstanding success. Many other retail malls have come on board in major city centres since then.  There is no doubt that the emergence  of retail malls have changed  the face of shopping in Nigerian cities of Abuja, Ibadan, Enugu, Port Harcourt  and Asaba  among others, revealing new generation of consumers.  However, despite the excitement that followed by shoppers and fun seekers, a visit to some of these new malls, especially in Lagos and Ogun States lately, showed that all is not well as many of the stores are still empty. <img class="size-medium wp-image-274555 alignleft" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/One-retail-mall-many-empty-stores-.png?resize=300%2C154&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="154" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/One-retail-mall-many-empty-stores-.png?resize=300%2C154&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/One-retail-mall-many-empty-stores-.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1">New Telegraph’s investigation showed that empty stores were evident in the Palm, Ota in Ogun State and Novare Mall, Sangotedo, Lekki-Ajah, Lagos State.  As these malls are not fully subscribed to by retailers. Further  findings showed that the  Palms Shopping Mall, Victoria Island, Ikeja Shopping Mall and  Ceddi Mall at CBD Abuja were full of activities.   Aside the formal malls, New Telegraph also discovered that empty stores were prevalent in the popular Tejuosho Shopping Complex at Yaba, while the newly-completed Ogba Multipurpose Shopping Complex  is yet to be occupied. According to a report, retailing in Nigeria posted slow growth in value terms at constant 2018 prices.  Reasons such as gloomy economic climate and fluctuations in the exchange rate were adduced to the slow growth.  Besides, economic uncertainties served to limit the budge of most consumers, who focused on buying basics goods and reined in their spending on non-essential products.  According to the Managing Director of Financial Derivatives Company, Mr Bismarck Rewane, in his latest report on the real estate sector, there was rising vacancy factor in the Nigerian malls.  Analysts from the company pointed out that empty stores in Nigerian malls were on the rise. These, they noted have reflected dwindling consumers’ purchasing power and deteriorating state of the economy.  According to the analysts, service charge was eroding profitability of retailers in the malls. Besides, advent of online shopping by Jumia, Konga, Kara and PayPorte, among others has reduced human traffic to the malls, as consumers can order their goods online and get deliveries without leaving their home.  According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), internet-user penetration in sub-Saharan Africa has grown from 0.5 per cent in 2000 to 10.6 per cent last year. Although the figure is still far behind the world average of about 30 per cent, an increasing number of Africans are becoming more familiar with online shopping.  Detailing  the retails’ vacancy rates in a report,  analysts from Tayo Odunsi-led Northcourt Real Estate, said the Palms Ota and Atlantic Mall, Lagos led the pack with 77 per cent and 75 per cent vacancy rate respectively. These were closely followed by Jabi Lake, Abuja- 40 per cent; Apapa Mall, Lagos- 38 per cent; Gateway Mall, Abuja -38 per cent and Silverbird Entertainment – 28 per cent.  The retail malls’ vacancy rates are Port Harcourt Mall -8 per cent; Genesis Centre, Port Harcourt – 25 per cent; Big Treat, Port Harcourt -15 per cent; The palm , Lagos -0 per cent; The Lagoon Shopping Centre – 13 per cent; Silver Bird Mall, laygos – 8 per cent; Novare Mall, Lagos – 28 per cent; Maryland Mall, Lagos- 8 per cent;  Leisure Mall, laygos  -12 per cent; Ikeja City Mall, Lagos – 2 per cent; Festival Mall, Lagos – 14 per cent; E-Centre Lagos – 7 per cent;  Circle Mall, Lagos -12 per cent ; Atlantic Mall, Lagos- 75 per cent; Apapa Mall, Lagos- -38 per cent;  Adeniran Ogunsanya Mall, Lagos – 9 per cent ; Silverbird Entertainment – 28 per cent; Jabi Lake, Abuja- 40 per cent; Grand Towers, Abuja- 15 per cent;  Gateway Mall, Abuja -38 per cent;  Ceddi plaza,Abuja- 21 per cent; they Palms, Ibadan  -25 per cent; and The Palms, Ota, Ogun – 77 per cent.   In a report, analysts from McKensey and Company estimated that between 2008 and 2020, there would be a $40 billion growth opportunity in food and consumer goods in Nigeria, the highest in any African nation. Consumers’ views According to a shopper at the Palm, Ota, Ogun State, Mr. Simeon Adelanke, who lived in Agbado Area of Lagos, unlike when the mall was opened for business newly, traffic to the mall has reduced tremendously. Besides, he said there were mini retail malls in inner streets that served as alternative to the big retail malls. According to him, except it was compulsory, people did not need to travel long distance to Ikeja or Ota, malls. He also attributed gridlock and people’s low income to low patronage of malls.  Another shopper in Ogba, who identified himself simply as “ Chris”, said the high rent is space in some of the malls was responsible for rising vacancy rate and  empty stores.  He pointed out that sale of a space per square metre in newly completed Ogba retail mall was put at N720,000 per annum, queuing the rationale behind the high rental value. “What is the person going to sell there? Who will buy the items?  How is the owner going to sell and make profit with such exorbitant rent,”  he said.  Others also blamed low income, traffic gridlock and emergence of mini stores within neibourghoods for rising vacancy rate in the malls.  ‘How can it be subscribed to when the developer puts the rent of space per square metre  at N720,000.?” one of the  shop owners  built by the Association of Police  Officers Wives built in Ogba, Mrs Cecilia  Obi,  said.  Another trader in cosmetics, Mrs Tina Godwin, said that  high rental values  of stores in most of the shopping malls coupled with current economic challenges  scared prospective tenants  away.   According to Mr. Sunday Ajayi, a banker, many mini retail malls such as QuickPick,  Supper Shoppy, Hubmart and Shopmart, among others  were being opened within streets and neibourghoods  in Lagos and other locations, pointing out that people, rather than travelling long distance, preferred to shop nearby.  This decision, he said took tenants and consumers out of big retail malls, except shoppers and fun seekers who are interested in cinemas and others exclusive services offered by the malls.   On Tejuosho Shopping Centre, a trader, Alhaja Serifat, who owns a shop nearby, said that many of those who rented shops in the ultra-modern market are regretting doing so due to low sale and high rent.  According to her, many of them have been battling to recoup their investments, adding that those who bought stores outright have not been able to make enough sales to justify their investments. This, she said made many traders to abandon their stores and moved to open shops in the fringes of the market complex.   An impeccable source at the Palm mall, Ota, said many of the stores have been rented out, but owners/ tenants were yet to open for business. According to him, some of the tenants have not opened to business due to reasons known to them  Further investigation by New Telegraph revealed that the amount of money for space per square metre in the mall was beyond what people around could cope with.  According to the source, the least lettable space in the mall was 30 square metres, while the highest was 60,000 square metres, adding that per square metre of space costs N30,000 each.   By implication, anyone seeking lettable space in the mall must be ready to pay N900,000 minimum, aside  from service charge and others. Except Shoprite store that people besieged to buy loaves of bread and household items, other stores in the mall suffered low sale.  Also, a source at Novare Mall  Lekki said the facility was still new and that as time passes by,  the mall would get maximum subscribers. Experts’views Lagos based estate surveyor and valuer,  Mr. Stephen Jagun, adduced  low purchasing power of citizens and poor economy as reasons for rising vacancy rate in some of the new retail malls.  “The purchasing power of citizens is very low; hence patronage is poor. The shops can come up with ways of driving traffic to their shops. Because if they don’t sell, they’ll not be able to pay their rent,” he said.  Jagun, who is the Principal Partner, Stephen Jagun and Associates,  also  blamed long  distance for low patronage and  higher percentage of vacant stores in   Novare Palm, Lekki and The Palm, Ota.  He said: “For Novare and Ota Palms, distance is a great factor to their performance. Road to Otta is horrible and those around the shop are not really buoyant.  “For Novare, you have to be in long traffic to visit.” He, however, expressed hope of a better patronage for the malls  when various estates around them  are fully occupied.  Another estate surveyor and valuer,  Mr.  Richard Olodu, stated that the advent of value of reality, affordability problem due to economic reality, and competition due to property market penetration by the available alternatives were responsible for         rising vacancy rate in most of the retail malls. Besides, Olodu added that wrong location, inaccurate demographics, assumptive development appraisals, expensive construction rates and wrong lifestyle focus, among others could be responsible.   According to Olodu, the malls spent too much money on lighting and heating because of imported design not utilizing natural lighting and ventilation. This, he said  made the cost of the shops to be expensive. “Only few shops (anchor shops) like Shoprite, PEP and SPAR (the biggest hypermarket chain in Nigeria) can survive the heat. Location of the malls is not the issue but traffic problems in Lagos. Purchasing power is also generally low,” he said. Olodu added that the most killing of the reasons was high  e-commerce patronage (online purchases).   He said : “People are buying increasingly from Jumai, Konga, PayPorte, VConnect, Kara, Printivo, OLX, Jiji, Obiwezzy and Ajebo market. Only Palm shopping mall at Oniru, City Mall at Onikan and CEDDI Mall at CBD Abuja are doing well.” Chairman,  H.O.B.  Estates Limited, Chief Olusegun Bamgbade, also blamed serious economic crisis, which has squeezed cash from pockets of low and middle income Nigerians for the rising vacancy rate. Bamgbade emphasised that the rising vacancy rate in the malls was a reflection of serious economic crisis in the country.   He added that people did not have enough money to patronize retail malls.   “There is a serious economic crisis in Nigeria. People don’t know yet. You’ll only know when you listen to people of varying categories. “You’ll hear people complain of no money; no shelter; no job; no one to run to; no one to help; etc. That’s why the suicide rate in Nigeria is now endemic. It wasn’t so before.” “Where people get employment opportunities, they don’t have transport fare to get there,” he said.  Bamgbade also pointed out that retail malls created veritable quantum of job opportunities, but their operators did not usually have enough funds to run it.  “Where there is fund, they don’t have ready staff for obvious reasons earlier stated. Where there’s fund, and ready staff, the purchasing power of the people is not available,” the HOB chairman said. He explained that if there had been concerted efforts to improve money supply in circulation, things would have fared better. According to him, if housing and construction sector have benefited immensely from government policies and actions, there would have been money in circulation. “If there’s money in circulation, retail malls would benefit more,” he said.   New Telegraph also learnt that due to the unfriendly economy climate, Nigeria did not record any deliveries of new space in the formal retail market as at the end third quarter of 2019 According to the report by Broll Nigeria, although some projects were nearing completion in the core and secondary markets, they are yet to be delivered.  These  uncompleted projects, Broll analysts said  measured below 10,000 square metres (m²) and included the Landmark Retail Boulevard (approximately 6,000m²) and the Simbiat Ikeja Mall in Lagos State (4,900m²); Oshogbo Mall in Osun State (roughly 5,000m²) and a retail project in Port Harcourt of approximately 9,000m².  However, analysts said there have been notable revisions upwards in rental values in the core market, noting that asking rentals in the successful malls in Lagos were  above $100 per square metre per month for 50m² – 250m² boxes.  “While, average asking rentals in other core market locations generally range from $40/m²/month to $75/m²/month, up from $30/m²/month to $70/m²/month recorded in H2:2018, rentals are flat in secondary market locations at $15/m²/month to $25/m²/month,” they said.  According to analysts, landlords in the core market retail malls were less inclined to offer discounted rentals, as was once the case during the economic recession, especially as vacancy rates declined in certain malls.   Analysts said: “Landlords are also generally unwilling to accept naira denominated rents in core market locations, however, with the exception of a small minority, naira rentals are welcomed in secondary market locations . “In the near term, landlords largely see no capacity for rental growth from current levels, and even though new deliveries are set to increase supply, it is not anticipated to be at a magnitude capable of disrupting current rental rates.” Analysts stated that landlords were able to highlight certain factors that existing occupiers now require to enhance the usability of their current space.  Such factors, according to them, included improved amenities, additional seating areas within the mall, free onsite parking to improve dwell time, early lease terminations and service charge reconciliations. One of the analysts said: “Possibly, the most important factor that has been highlighted by existing tenants is a reduction in occupied box sizes.  “Medium to large box sizes have proven difficult to lease in both core and secondary retail markets as prospective tenants are unable to justify the financial costs attributed to acquiring these premises which range from 100m² – 1,000m².”   On overall vacancy rate, another analyst said it averaged 20 per cent across core and secondary market locations, noting that the very successful malls were operating below two per cent.  On rental values, the Broll report stated that rents have remained largely unchanged in first half of 2019 in secondary market location   However, until the nation’s economy improves, rising vacancy rate in the retail sector will continue.
