 T he President of the Nigeria Football federation, Amaju Pinnick has defended the decision to lure Queen Park Rangers midfielder into playing for the country, saying his addition will make the Super Eagles stronger ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The NFF boss has come under criticism aftyer after pictures of him and  Eze surfaced online with a caption suggesting the duo met in London, England for discussion regarding the Eagles.  “Can you imagine a midfield with (Wilfred) Ndidi, (Joe) Aribo,(Oghene)  Etebo  and Eze?  I’ve no regrets talking to Eze, who visited me at home with his girlfriend,” Pinnick said.   “We need to make a solid representation at Qatar 2022 & it starts with improving on your squad with quality players like Eze.” We talked at length in my house and I won’t relent on his pursuit until the deal is done. “He is Nigerian, the next big football sensation and I would rather he achieves that mission wearing Nigeria’s jerseys, instead of playing for another country.”
