President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday charged the governors on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to stop giving excuses to the people when it comes to service delivery.
The President gave the charge at the 3rd Federal Government/Progressives Governors Forum (PGF) Parley on Policy Synergy with the theme: Strengthening Public Service Delivery, which held in Jos Plateau State, just as the National Chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole demanded that APC governors should be the first to pay the new N30,000 minimum wage and more.
Representated by Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, the President said his government will do everything possible not to betray the trust given to him by Nigerian electorate.
He said: “Early in 2019, Nigerians overwhelmingly re-elected me as their President. That election was a referendum on not just my leadership but on our party. Similarly, some state governors were re-elected while new ones also came on board. To whom much is giving, much is expected. It is therefore incumbent on on us to meet the expectations of our teeming population. There should be no room for excuses and that is where the outcome of this parley, bevomes very critical.”
According to the Buhari, the current administration has remained committed to improving the welfare of all Nigerians.
The President said the decision to focus the parley on four key sectors, namely; transportation, health, education and humanitarian and disaster management were commendable.
