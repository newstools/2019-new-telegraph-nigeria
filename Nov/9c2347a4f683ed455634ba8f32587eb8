Former Provost Marshal of the Nigerian Army, Brigadier-General Idada Ikponmwen (rtd) Sunday faulted the continued closure of Nigerian borders to its neighbours, pointing out that the action negates several international treaties Nigeria is a signatory to. He said what was needed was proper and efficient policing of the borders. Speaking to newsmen in Benin, the Edo State capital, Ikponmwen also frowned at the notion that President Muhammadu Buhari could govern from anywhere adding that his decision not to handover to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo negates the spirit and letters of the 1999 Constitution. He said there was the urgent need for the Customs and Immigration Services to wake to their principal responsibilities of manning the porous borders with neighbouring countries to checkmate the observable lapses and excesses of criminal elements and their collaborators. He cautioned that the porosity of the country’s borders in both Southern and Northern states is inexcusable as the executive arm of government shown much ineptitude and corruption on many places. He said “Our border closure negates the concept of free trade, free movement of people of the ECOWAS region and African Free Trade Treaty (AFT) agreement, both of which the country is signatory too.”
