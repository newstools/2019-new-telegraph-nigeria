The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called for an investigation into the cause of the fire that gutted some buildings in the Balogun Market in Lagos State a few days ago.
The party also called for probe into the cause of the delay in putting in place measures that would ensure more proactive fire emergency interventions in the country.
PDP in a statement Thursday by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, expressed sadness over the losses encountered by traders in the market.
The party said it was “disturbed by the manifest system deficiencies that led to the failure to promptly bring the fire under control and abate the losses.”
It  commiserated with victims of the inferno and urged the government as well as public-spirited groups and individuals to come to their aid.
