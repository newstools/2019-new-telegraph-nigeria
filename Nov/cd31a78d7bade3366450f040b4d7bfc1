The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has been asked to disqualify the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Engr. Musa Wada, for tomorrow’s governorship election in Kogi State over alleged forgery of his school certificate. The claimant, one Femi Joseph, had in a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/1146/2019 dragged the PDP, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and Wada before the court. The suit was instituted by way of an originating summons at the registry of the court on September 27, shortly after the publication of Forms CF001 (particulars of persons seeking election to office) of all candidates in the Kogi gubernatorial election by INEC. The claimant through his counsel, Mike Enahoro submitted that by virtue of Section 31(5) & (6) of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended), he reasonably believes that the information supplied by the PDP candidate in both his Form CF001 and the attached First School Leaving Certificate as to his primary school education were false. He therefore prayed the court to determine that the information was indeed false and on that basis, disqualify the plaintiff from contesting as the candidate of the PDP. He prayed the court to determine whether having regard to the clear and unambiguous provisions of Section 31 (5) and (6) of the Electoral Act, 2010 (As Amended), 3rd Defendant’s INEC FORM CFOO1 and the Primary School Certificate, bearing Number: 910922, attached therewith and submitted to the 2nd Defendant by the 1st and 3rd Defendants, contain false information regarding the 3rd Defendant’s Primary School Certificate He also wants the court to determine whether having regard to the clear and unambiguous provisions of Section 31 (5) and (6) of the Electoral Act, 2010 (As Amended), vis-a-vis 3rd Defendant’s INEC FORM CFOO1 and the Primary School Certificate, bearing Number: 910922, attached therewith and submitted to the 2nd Defendant by the 1st and 3rd Defendants, the 3rd Defendant is disqualified from contesting the Kogi State Governorship Election slated for 16th day of November, 2019, for submitting to the 2nd Defendant false information regarding the 3rd Defendant’s Primary School Certificate. While the PDP as a party has responded to the said suit, Wada is yet to file any response.
