The governor of Bayelsa State, Henry Seriake Dickson has pledged to continue giving corps members posted to the state all the welfare and security that they need.
Speaking on Monday at Kaima during the closing ceremony of 2019 Batch C Stream 1 Orientation Course for corps members deployed to the state for their mandatory one year national service, Dickson, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary General Services, Anthony Ikhobo, also enjoined the corps members to quickly report to their places of posting and passionately contribute their quota to the development of host communities through primary and secondary assignments.
“Initiate and embark on viable projects that will positively impact your host communities. In this wise, I hasten to declare you as ‘ Restoration Agents’ that will partner with the state government in developmental programmes especially in health, education and infrastructural development.
“I want to once again assure you that your welfare and security remain our top priority. I have put sufficient polices in place to ensure your security and welfare throughout your stay in Bayelsa State. My government has continued to engage corps members in developmental programmes for the mutual benefit of the state and the NYSC Scheme,” the governor explained.
Earlier in a welcome address, the NYSC Bayelsa State Coordinator, Mrs Ojugo Elizabeth Iyowuna commended the government and good people of Bayelsa for the support to NYSC programmes.
She equally commended the Headquarters 16 Brigade Nigeria Army, the INEC Bayelsa Resident Electoral Commissioner, Federal Medical Center (FMC) Yengoa and other collaborating agencies for releasing their personnel to participate in the orientation exercise.
