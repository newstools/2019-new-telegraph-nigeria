Onyekachi Eze, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to reject results coming from Okene and Okehi local government areas of Kogi State, alleging that they have been compromised. The party in a statement Saturday by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, accused the agents of Governor Yahaya Bello and the All Progressives Congress (APC) of threatening and forcing INEC presiding officers and members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) to endorse pre-filled results sheets in favour of the APC, in some local government areas. PDP further alleged that the governor and the APC were desperate to to allocate fictitious votes and fabricate results in their favour in Okene and Okehi Local Government Areas in Kogi Central senatorial zone. “For instance, in Kabba/Bunu Okekoko Ward Unit 9, the baby units have been reduced from two to one, a situation that will lead to disenfranchising of voters to reduce votes belonging to the PDP. “Also the serial numbers on the ballot papers brought to the area is different from numbers on ballot papers released in Abuja for the area,” the party alleged. PDP said it would not accept manipulated results coming from Okene and Okehi local government areas
