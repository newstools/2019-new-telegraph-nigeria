 The Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) has expressed displeasure with consistent dwindling in revenue accruing from mines and steel sector into federation account, New Telegraph has learnt. To this end, a team was raised by FAAC to meet with top officials of the Federal Ministry of Mines and Steel Development (MMSD) with a view to establishing reasons, and proffer solutions to halt further revenue dip. Insider source hinted this medium that FAAC had established consistent dip over time in revenue flow from mines and steel sources, and resolved to confront officials of the ministry for explanation. An official document sighted by New Telegraph over the weekend confirmed FAAC’s worries regarding revenue dip in the sector. “The chairman, post mortem sub-committee referred to the decision at the last meeting that mandated the PMSC to liaise with the MMSD on strategies put in place to improve revenue generation from the mines and steel sector. “The committee met with the Permanent Secretary, Alhaji Abdulkadir Mu’azu and other officials of the ministry on Friday, 11th October, 2019,” FAAC noted in the official document sighted over the weekend. It was learnt that some of the challenges cited by the ministry as responsible for dip revenue remittance into federation purse include, lack of enabling environment for mining operators; ambiguity of the Land Use Act vis-a-vis the Solid Mineral Department Act, 2007 as it relates to the ownership and control of resources. The summary of revenue collection from mines and steel sources between January and October, 2019 exclusively obtained by our correspondent showed a total sum of N4,195,372,560.71. Breakdown of collections showed that in January 2019, the sum of N346,049,105.83 was collected, N351,408, 486.69 in February, N503,938,341.12 March, April collection was N423,472,370.30, May N350,945,953.98, June N227,222,294.82; July N460,810,493.22, August collection N716,827,116.09, September N372,583,350.60 while the sum of N442,115,048.06 was collected as revenue in October. The balance in the solid minerals revenue account as at 31st October, 2019 stood at N16,782,803,052.76 as against the June 2019 figure of N14,790,467,044.79 and November 2018 figure of N12. 2 billion. FAAC shared N702.058 billion last week to three tires of government as revenue for month of October. The sum of N8,700,232,009.05 of the amount came from solid minerals revenue account domiciled with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Sources at Mines and Steel Ministry said issue of revenue dip has been brought to the attention of the minister, Arch. Olamilekan Adegbite. He said the minister recently inaugurated a 14 man ministerial committee whose mandate include, closing leakages, tackling illegal mining and enhancing generated revenue from the mining sector. A committee on optimisation of revenue from mineral resources sector, New Telegraph learnt was inaugurated last week by the minister. Members of the committee were tasked to carefully record artisanal mining activities that are geared towards revenue generation. “The committee is to ensure that revenue generated from artisanal miners’ activities are recorded and work out ways to block leakages from illegal mining accruals. Blockage of mineral revenue leakages and proper recording would boost the economy and encourage more people to go into mining, which would lift the masses out of poverty. “So far, the mineral sector contributes about one per cent to the GDP, and according to the roadmap, we are hoping that by 2025, we can raise this to about five per cent. “The country has over 44 minerals. If we can harness that, it will increase the revenue base of the country. There are activities going on in this sector by the artisanal miners which are not recorded. These are not captured in the revenue of government. They account for about 95 per cent of what is mined and exported. Inaugurating a committee like this, they will look at those avenues of leakages and come up with policies and action plan and look at that,” the minister said. Chairman of the committee, Minister of State for Mines and Steel Development, Dr. Uchechukwu Ogah, regretted that the solid mineral sector, with its great potential, could only contribute less than N4 billion revenue annually.
