Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has called on wealthy sons and daughters of the state to channel their influence and wealth toward supporting the government in developing their respective communities. He made the call on Friday while inaugurating the Old Ileogbo-Iwo road. The 3.85 kilometre road was flagged off by the governor in March, 2019 in furtherance of his earlier approval for the construction of the road, which was singlehandedly facilitated by Engr. Abel Adeleke as his contribution to the development of his community. The governor lauded the philanthropic gesture of Adeleke in using his position at the Peculiar Group where he works to influence development in his community. He said: “The road project is a product of philosophy and personal sacrifice by a wellmeaning son of Ileogbo, Mr Abel Olanrewaju Adeleke. “On behalf of the government, the people of Ileogbo in particular and Osun in general, I thank Adeleke for this huge contribution to the socioeconomic development of Ileogbo and its environs. “This is a commendable community development endeavour that government cannot take for granted since government alone cannot provide all the needs of the people “I, therefore, call on other towns as well as wealthy indigenes of our state to emulate this gesture to make massive development achievable in the state. “As you are all aware, massive construction, rehabilitation and upgrading of roads are critical to the Development Agenda of our government and we are using them as the drivers of the economic transformation of the state.”
