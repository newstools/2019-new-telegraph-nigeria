Turkish champions Galatasaray are plotting a move for Bordeaux’s Nigeria international Samuel Kalu. According to Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, Kalu has been offered to Galatasaray by a French intermediary following the injuries suffered by Radamel Falcao and Florin Andone. The report added that the unnamed French agent contacted Vice-President Abdurrahim Albayrak and said that he could bring Samuel Kalu, provided the winger’s asking price is met. Allnigeriasoccer.com can report that though the identity of the agent remains a mystery, Kalu is represented by French-based agent William D’Avila of DW Sports Management, who has close ties to Galatasarayand Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr, so this is not a transfer rumour. D’Avila was among the agents that brokered the deal that took Henry Onyekuru to Galatasaray in the 2018-2019 season and also handles the affairs of another Galatasaray-owned player, Valentine Ozornwafor. Kalu joined Bordeaux on a five-year deal in August 2018 for a fee in the region of 8.5 million euros and has gone on to make 45 appearances for the Ligue 1 club in all competitions, scoring 5 goals and providing six assists.
