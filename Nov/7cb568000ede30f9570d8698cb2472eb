In 1888, 130 years ago, George Safford Parker founded the world’s largest pen factory, obtaining his own patent – the fountain pen Parker. A pen was no longer considered a writing instrument ever since. The writer’s tool gained an unprecedented status and leveled up its prestige rank with the help of new discerning owners and collectors: powerful politicians, business figures, show-business celebrities.   Even in this technology age we still use pens in our daily lives. Whether to write down a note while on a phone call or even something as simple as a grocery list, a pen will be needed to do so.   Due to the variety of materials and new pattern-making technologies, golden pens were put in the same rank as executive-class cars and Swiss-made watches.   The most expensive pen costs $1,470,600! The Aurora Diamant e Fountain Pen is the most expensive writing instrument and contains over 30 carats of De Beer’s diamonds on a solid platinum barrel. It has a two-tone, rhodium-treated, 18KT solid gold nib and is personalized with a coat of arms, signature or portrait. The golden masterpiece Aurora Diamante is not inferior in price to the mansion in Beverly Hills, which makes this pen an unquestionable leader in the top of the world’s most expensive pens made of gold. The Italian company produces such models in limited quantities: one per year.
