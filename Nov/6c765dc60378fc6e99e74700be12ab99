Former Minister of State for Agriculture and governorship aspirant in Bayelsa State, Senator Heineken Lokpobri has asked his supporters to vote for the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief David Lyon in the forthcoming election.
Lokpobri, who spoke to the media Thursday at the private office of the APC National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole in Abuja, however, said his case against the APC governorship primaries was still valid.
The former minister, who is aggrieved over the APC governorship primaries in Bayelsa State and has gone to court to challenge the outcome, said he would remain in APC that gave him a platform to serve as a minister.
Speaking in the company of the APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, the Chairman of the Bayelsa State Governorship Campaign Council and Governor of Jigawa State, Alhaji Abubakar Badaru and the chairman of the Progressive Governors’ Forum and governor of Kebbi State, Senator Atiku Bagudu, Lokpobiri said he has no reason to work against his party, the APC.
Addressing the media, he said: “The reason why I am here is to pay a courtesy call on the National Chairman having been spoken to by him and I have a great respect for him and the  president.
“l am a very strong member of APC and I came today to formally tell our Chairman and to speak to Nigerians and particularly the electorate in Bayelsa that all of them should vote for APC regardless of what will happen in the matter that is fixed for judgment on November 14. No matter what happens as the case may be I will now remember I worked for the success of the party which is more important than anybody’s personal interest.”
