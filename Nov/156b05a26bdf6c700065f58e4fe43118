At least 30 suspected Boko Haram Terrorists (BHTs) operating in the fringes of Sambisa Forest in Borno State, have been killed in air operations.
The operation by the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) component of Operation Lafiya Dole, was conducted on Wednesday.
Director of Public Relations and Information (DOPRI), Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, who made the disclosure in a statement Thursday, said the operation was occasioned by intelligence reports indicating the presence of the terrorist elements within the location.
According to the DOPRI, the intelligence, surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) mission, had revealed the presence of some 30 enemies of state at the location.
He explained that, some of the suspects, who fled the location, after the targeted hit, were later neutralised.
