      Tragedy struck residents of Ankpa Quarters area of Makurdi metropolis on Thursday as a nine-year-old girl identified as Maria Abah committed suicide. The girl, according to the state Police Command’s Public Relations Officer, DSP Catherine Sewuese Anene, committed the crime right inside her room. Anene said the command was yet to ascertain the reason why the little girl decided to take her life at that age. She said that the Command has commenced investigation to unravel the mystery behind her death. Anene said corpse of the deceased had been deposited at the morgue at the Bishop Murray’s Hospital in Makurdi. The Police spokesperson assured that police would not rest on their oars until the truth about the suicide is uncovered, as no one she said, has been arrested hence it has not been established as a culpable homicide. However, neighbours, who spoke to New Telegraph said the deceased who hailed from Owukpa in Ogbadibo Local Government Area of the state, was brought to Makurdi by the General Overseer of Mount Zion Ministry in Makurdi as a house-help to the woman who runs the church before the incident happened. Late Maria was said to be staying in the same room with the General Overseer’s other children where she was said to have been found dead on the floor Thursday.
