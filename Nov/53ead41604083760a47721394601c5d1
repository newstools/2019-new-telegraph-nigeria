An Ikeja High Court, Lagos Tuesday remanded a dismissed Police Inspector, Ogunyemi Olalekan, at the Ikoyi Prisons for the alleged murder of a 35-year-old man, Kolade Johnson at a viewing centre in Lagos. The 45-year-old police officer, who pleaded not guilty, was arraigned on a one-count charge of murder. According to Mr Yhaqub Oshoala, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), the police officer, before his dismissal, was working with the Special Anti-Cultism Squad (SACS) of the Nigeria Police Force. Oshoala said that the defendant committed the offence at about 5.10pm on March 31 at Onipetesi Estate, Mangoro area of Lagos. “The former police inspector unlawfully killed Johnson by shooting him with an AK47 rifle in the lower abdomen. “The offence contravenes Section 223 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015,” Oshoala said. However, following Olalekan’s not guilty plea, requested that the defendant, who has since been incarcerated after his arrest, remain prison custody pending the determination of the case. “We ask that the defendant continue to be detained in prison custody before the trial date. Our witnesses are available and we are ready to commence,” Oshoala said.
