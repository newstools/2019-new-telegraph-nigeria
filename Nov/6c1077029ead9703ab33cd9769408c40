Minister of Sports Sunday Dare has expressed profound displeasure at the sliding fortune of Nigerian football following the failure of Dream Team to qualify for the 2020 Olympic Games.  The minister wrote on his Twitter account that it was important to chart a new course for the game. “Nigeria’s game against S.A. (South Africa) which ended in a draw concentrates the mind.  Time to take a look back and find out where the rain began to beat us. Like I said before, our football needs a return to the basics of grassroot football, pristine sports admin, sound technical coaching…,” the Minister tweeted early on Saturday morning.  “Government will take appropriate steps and in a timely fashion to improve our football fortunes. Current outcomes offer the opportunity to review, restrategize and develop a long term plan for football development. We will dust up great ideas already abandoned and implement.”  “Nigerian football across the spectrum will benefit from this new outlook which will involve critical stakeholders. Government, mindful that Nigeria is a football nation will be bold in embracing best practices in modern football.”
