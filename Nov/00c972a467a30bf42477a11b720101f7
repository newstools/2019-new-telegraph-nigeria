Granit Xhaka has told Arsenal he wants to leave but the Gunners are concerned about selling the midfielder in January, according to reports. The Switzerland international was stripped of the Arsenal captaincy this week for his irate response to supporters who booed him off the pitch in the 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace last month. Xhaka has not played for Arsenal since the draw against Roy Hodgson’s side at the Emirates Stadium and Unai Emery has been evasive when asked about whether the midfielder still has a future at the club. Meanwhile, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has replaced Xhaka as Arsenal captain. According to MailOnline, Xhaka has now made it known to Arsenal that his preference is to leave the club following his clash with supporters. But the report claims that Arsenal are ‘concerned’ that teams looking to buy Xhaka will try to capitalise on the midfielder’s fall-out with supporters and will submit low offers. It’s also claimed that Arsenal’s hierarchy felt that Xhaka should have stepped down from his role as captain immediately after the incident, rather than allow the situation to drag out for several days. Emery had privately called on Xhaka to issue a swift apology but the midfielder delayed his response until last Thursday where he then claimed the abuse he had received from Arsenal supporters had provoked his reaction. Arsenal are understood to be hopeful of receiving an offer for Xhaka which reflects the £34 million they paid to sign him from Borussia Monchengladbach in 2016. Xhaka still has just under four years left on his current £100,000-a-week contract with Arsenal which expires in 2023, reports metro.co.uk.
