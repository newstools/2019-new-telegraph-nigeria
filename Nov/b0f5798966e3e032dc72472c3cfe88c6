Kunle Olayeni, Abeokuta Sultan of Sokoto and President-General, Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), Alhaji Saâ€™ad Abubakar, has expressed dissatisfaction with the number of universities established by Muslim organisations in the country. Abubakar said there is urgent need for the Nawair-Ud-Deen Society of Nigeria (NUD) and other Muslim groups to rise to the occasion and address the prevailing educational challenges across the nation. He spoke at the 80th anniversary of NUD and presentation of merit and posthumous awards to deserving individuals which held, weekend, at its National Central Mosque, Abeokuta, Ogun State. At the event, which was attended by eminent personalities and distinguished Islamic scholars, Governor Dapo Abiodun also commended NUD for its efforts fostered at sustaining religious peace through the provision of education. Abiodun, who was represented by his deputy, Engr. Noimot Salako-Oyedele, asked the Muslim organisation to partner with his administration in repositioning the education sector in the state for optimal performance. In his remarks, the Sultan urged influential Muslims to support the Nawair-Ud-Deen Society of Nigeria in establishing tertiary institutions across the country. According to him, Muslim children deserve qualitative education and good schools to contribute towards nation-building. Abubakar, who lauded the NUD for its investments in education, challenged the organisation to also consider setting up universities to adequately educate Muslim children in accordance with Islamic tradition. The Sultan noted that such universities would also address the discrimination arising from the use of hijab by Muslim females in certain educational institutions.
