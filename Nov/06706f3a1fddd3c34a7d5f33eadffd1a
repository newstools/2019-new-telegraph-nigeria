President Muhammadu Buhari has cut short his two-week private visit to London by two days as he arrived the Presidential Wing of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport Abuja on Friday evening. The president, who was on official visit to Saudi Arabia before the commencement of the private visit to London on November 2, was initially scheduled to return to Nigeria on November 17. The president attended the third Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where he later performed the Lesser Hajj alongside Governors Atiku Bagudu, Aminu Masari and Babagana Zulum of Kebbi, Katsina and Borno States. The Nigerian leader was in Saudi Arabia when the Supreme Court on October 30, dismissed the appeal by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar challenging his victory at the February 23 presidential poll. President Buhari returned to Abuja on the day the apex court ruled that he was “eminently qualified” to contest the presidential election. The presidential aircraft conveying the Nigerian leader and few of his aides landed at the airport at about 9.40p.m. The President was received on arrival by his Chief of Staff, Malam Abba Kyari, FCT Minister, Malam Muhammed Bello, some heads of security agencies and presidential aides.
