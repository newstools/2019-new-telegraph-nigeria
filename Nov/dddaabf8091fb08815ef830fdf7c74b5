…22,889 foreigners refused entry    N o fewer than 17,616 Nigerians were deported back to the country, from across the world in 2018.  Also, 22,889 foreign nationals were denied entry into Nigeria for various reasons, even as 1,044 Nigerians were blocked from travelling overseas in the same year.  The statistics were made available in the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) Border Management Strategy (2019 – 2023) obtained by our correspondent in Abuja. According to the Service, 339 Nigerians got repatriated from across the globe, with 33 cases of stowaways recorded.  The Federal Government granted asylum to 15,458 foreigners in 2018, out of a total of 31,475 applications received. A total of 46,933 refugees were received in the same year. Further perusal of the manual indicated that immigration operatives intercepted a total of 454 victims of human trafficking, child labour and smuggling of migrants, while 78 human trafficking suspects met their Waterloo. Nigeria’s borders witnessed traffic in 2018, with a total of 4,529,158 travellers crossing her designated borders.  While 78 per cent of the number entered and exited the country by air, about 70 per cent of the travellers were Nigerians.  This was as the NIS further disclosed in the four-year strategy document, that it issued a total of 1,227,158 passports in the year under review.  The 4.5 million figure of international travellers showed a 22 per cent increase over that of 2017, according to the referenced document.  “NIS operates at the front line of Immigration control at all five of the nation’s international airports (Abuja, Enugu, Kano, Lagos and Port Harcourt) and at other airports that are temporarily set up for international travel on key religious and cultural occasions,” the report said.
