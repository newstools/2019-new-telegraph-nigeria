A 63-year-old high school teacher accused of having sex with a 17-year-old student was found dead alongside her hubby in their North Carolina home, authorities said. Emma Neil Ogle and her husband Michael died from gunshot wounds Wednesday at their Huntersville home in the wake of her sex scandal at Garnier High School, news station Fox46 reported. Police said a relative called 911 to report that Ogle was armed and barricaded inside the residence with her husband, reports New York Post. Officers arrived to the scene to discover her husband dead inside from a gunshot wound, according to the report. The teacher died shortly after her husband, though the circumstances surrounding her death are unclear, Fox46 reported. Ogleâ€™s death comes after she was arrested last Thursday on charges she had sex with a student 46 years her junior. School officials said the veteran teacher was suspended without pay from the district following her arrest.
