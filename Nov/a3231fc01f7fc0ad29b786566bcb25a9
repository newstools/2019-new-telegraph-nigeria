Tottenham have sacked head coach Mauricio Pochettino after five years in charge of the Premier League club. The former Southampton boss, 47, was appointed in May 2014 and led Spurs to the Champions League final last season, where they lost to Liverpool, reports the BBC. But the club have made a disappointing start to the current campaign and are 14th in the Premier League. “We were extremely reluctant to make this change,” said Spurs chairman Daniel Levy. “It is not a decision the board has taken lightly, nor in haste. Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.”
