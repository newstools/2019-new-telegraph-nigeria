Following the ordeal which former governor of Imo State, Owelle Rochas Okorocha faced that almost submerged him without a helping hand coming from high quarters; the statue-loving Senator may have decided to become a lone ranger who expresses his thoughts without fear or favour.   The road to Damascus for the former presidential aspirant began when he tried to impose his son in-law, Uche Nwosu on the electorate. His party, the APC, would have none of that and frustrated his plans. The eventual division between the governor and his party paved the way for Emeka Ihedioha of the PDP to emerge the new governor.   Also, it is on record that having won his senatorial election, Okorocha faced another battle as his certificate of return was withheld by INEC on allegation that he pressured the resident electoral commissioner into announcing results in his favour. It took the intervention of a high court before he could join his colleagues at the red chambers.   Having gone through his ordeal, he seems to have decided to pitch his tent as a lone ranger who is no longer diplomatic in his utterances but speaks not minding whose ox is gored. Not too long ago, he suggested having three senators from each state should be scrapped and replace it with one senator per state. This of course didnâ€™t go down well with his colleagues in the chamber as the motion was expressly ignored. Recently also, he spoke about dicey chances of APC surviving beyond 2023. This also, some believe, it was a jibe aimed at some folks in the party
