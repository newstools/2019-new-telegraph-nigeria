The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said that the Republic of Benin continues to post a strong economic performance despite the closure of the country’s border with Nigeria. In a press release issued at the completion of the latest visit to Benin by an IMF Mission, the fund quoted   Luc Eyraud, who led the staff team  during the visit as saying that “Benin’s recent economic performance remains strong despite a less supportive external environment and the closure of the border with Nigeria. “Real GDP is expected to grow by 6.4 per cent in 2019, mostly driven by the agriculture and transport sectors. Growth should accelerate in 2020 and remain sustained over the medium term, buttressed by vigorous cotton production, construction, and port activities. “Consumer price inflation, affected by the high agriculture production, has been on a declining trend, falling by 1.4 percent in the first nine months of 2019, relative to the same period one year earlier. “It is expected to remain well below the 3.0 per cent regional ceiling in 2019 and 2020. The fiscal deficit for 2019 is estimated at 2.3 per cent of the recently rebased GDP. “Performance under the IMF-supported program has been very satisfactory so far this year. All end-June 2019 quantitative performance criteria and the end-September structural benchmark program were met.”
