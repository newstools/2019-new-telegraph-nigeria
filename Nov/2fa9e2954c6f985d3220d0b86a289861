The Special Assistant on Social Media to President Muhmmadu Buhari, Laureta Onochie has declared that the Chairman and founder of Air Peace, Allen Onyema deserves to face the $20 million fraud allegations levelled against him by the United States government. Onochie, on her official Twitter handle @Laurestar, said that the Air Peace Chief Executive is only reaping what he has sowed. According to the presidential aide, she is yet to understand what President Muhammadu Buhari should have done with a man so indicted by the United States government. “I do not understand what Pres. @MBuhari has to do with Mr. Onyema of Air Peace being indicted and charged in the USA. According to our Attorney General, the Federal Government has not even been informed of the situation,” Onechie noted. The United States Department of Justice, on Friday last week, charged the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Air Peace, Mr. Allen Onyema, with bank fraud and money laundering for moving more than $20 million from Nigeria through United States bank accounts in a scheme involving false documents based on the purchase of airplanes. Onechie, in her remarks, explained that: “American laws go after those who BREAK them. What a man sows… “How much has Nigeria invested in the Niger Delta Amnesty Programme, NDDC and 13% derivation funds? All, mostly in a black hole. “Do we know the extent of poverty, ignorance and disease in the Niger Delta? Please let America too help us see how Niger Delta underdeveloped Niger Delta. “Those of us from the Niger Delta who are the direct beneficiaries of the sufferings that emanated from the looting of our wealth, will tackle them. It’s our war that is being fought. “Laws, Nigerian or American, go after those who break them so we must mind our business. QED!”
