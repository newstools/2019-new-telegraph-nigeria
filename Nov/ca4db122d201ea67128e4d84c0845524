    The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Ilorin Zonal Office has secured the conviction of one Abolarin Kayode who was being prosecuted on offences bordering on internet fraud and other fraud related offences. Abolarin was on Thursday convicted and sentenced to six months imprisonment by a High Court sitting in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, which was presided over by Justice Sikiru Oyinloye. The defendant after his arraignment had pleaded with the Commission for plea bargain, having considered his involvement in internet fraud and the proof of evidence gathered against him by the anti-graft body. The amended charge stated: “That you,  Abolarin Kayode on or about 6th day of February 2019, in Ilorin within the jurisdiction of the High Court of Kwara State, did attempt to cheat by impersonation, when you presented yourself as Dawn Groff and sent an email to one Gregory Carter, an American citizen through your acclaimed email groffdawn77@gmail.com, that Budweiser Drink is carrying out Vehicle advertisement programme, a representation you knew to be false and thereby committed an offence contrary to section 95 of the penal code and punishable under section 324 of the same penal code.” The accused person pleaded guilty to the amended charge. While reviewing the facts of the case, Olamide Sadiq, an Operative of the EFCC told the court that: “My Lord, on the 4th of February 2019, based on intelligence reports, operatives of the Commission arrested the defendant and others at Agric Estate in Ilorin for their involvement in internet scam, we analysed his phone and laptop and discovered that he created four emails for himself, the email conversations were printed in his presence and discovered that he sent several fraudulent messages to his victims, that was the circumstance in which I knew the defendant my Lord.” Delivering judgment on the matter, Justice Oyinloye said the prosecution had been able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, adding that the anti-graft body had also been able to link the defendant with the allegations of intent fraud brought against him.
