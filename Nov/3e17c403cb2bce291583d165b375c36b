The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Oyo State Command, on Thursday destroyed about 40 hectares of Indian hemp plantation in Aba Tade, Oluyole Local Government Area of the state.
While addressing newsmen during the exercise, the state NDLEA Commander, Mr Ralph Igwenagu, said the command had previously destroyed six hectares of plantation in Oke Ogun area of the state.
He noted that the discovery of the plantation was an indication that a good number of farmers in the state were engaging in Indian hemp cultivation.
According to him, five suspects have been arrested in connection with the plantation, adding that investigation was still ongoing.
Determined not only to destroy Indian hemp plantations, the Commander said the agency would reduce its trafficking and abuse to the barest minimum in the state.
