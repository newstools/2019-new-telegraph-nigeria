A non-governmental organisation, the Legal Defence and Assistance Project (LEDAP) has dragged the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio and four others to the Federal High Court in Abuja to challenge the composition of a three-man interim committee to run the affairs of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). In the suit, LEDAP alongside three Niger Delta indigenes; Iruo Onoruvwe, Anatole Osuji and Walter Abere, are questioning the powers of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, to constitute the interim committee. The minister had told reporters in Abuja last week that the interim committee was to prepare ground for the new Board and supervise the forensic audit which President Muhammadu Buhari had ordered weeks ago. Dissatisfied with the arrangement, LEDAP through its Executive Director, Mr. Chino Obiagwu (SAN) and the three Niger Delta indigenes dragged Akpabio, the NDDC and the three men who constituted the interim committee to court. The three men who were named as the third to fifth defendants are; Dr. Gbene Joi Nunieh, Dr. Cairo Ojougboh and Chief Ibanga Bassey Etang. In the suit, the plaintiffs argued that the composition of the interim committee by Akpabio is contrary to Section 2, 10 and 12 of the Niger Delta Development Commission (Establishment, etc) Act No 6, 2000 (as amended). They argued that under Section 12 of the said Act, it is only the president that can appoint the Managing Director and Executive Directors of the NDDC and that such powers cannot be delegated to the minister. They further argued that the president had already nominated certain persons to be appointed as Managing Director and Executive Directors of the NDDC and same had already been legally confirmed by the Senate.
