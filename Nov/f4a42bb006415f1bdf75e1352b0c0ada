Former Super Eagles’ striker, Daniel Amokachi, has said Coach Gernot Rohr will be faced with selection problem in his quest for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations AFCON and 2022 World Cup finals both in Cameroon and Qatar but expressed satisfaction with the array of talented young players on offer to the team. He said that the coach would have problems selecting the best possible starting line-up at each point in time. ‘The Bull’ as Amokachi is fondly called said that the Eagles would not find it difficult qualifying for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, but went on to warn that reaching the right combination of players for each match will be a dilemma for Rohr. The former Club Brugge of Belgium, Everton of England and Besiktas of Turkey all-action attacker added that Rohr would have to be firm in his choice of players for each match, considering that his vast collection of skilful and effective players could pose a challenge in making the right decisions on who to drop and who to play. He, however, reckoned that the rare Nigerian fighting spirit and winning mentality should see the side through the AFCON 2021 qualifiers, where they have already won their first two matches and next play Sierra Leone home and away in August 2020. Amokachi, who has since handled Nigeria’s B-squad and a club in Finland, said: “There should be no problem in Nigeria qualifying for AFCON. Making it to AFCON is not the problem, but the problem is how to employ the talents we have in the right way. How do we achieve the right choice of players on the pitch to get the results we want?”
