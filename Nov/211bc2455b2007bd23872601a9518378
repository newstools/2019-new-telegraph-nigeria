Ex-militant leaders in the Niger Delta yesterday passed a vote of confidence on the Interim Management Committee (IMC) of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), saying it is credible to change the lives of the rural communities.  The duo, General Victor Ebikabowei (aka BoyLoaf) and General Jakrich Sobomabo aka (Egberipapa), who spoke during a courtesy visit to the IMC at the NDDC’s headquarters, said: “We the ex-militant leaders and people of the Niger Delta region are fully in support of the Interim Management Committee of the NDDC where we have capable hands like Joi Nunieh, Managing Director, Dr. Cairo Ojougboh, Executive Director Projects (EDP) and Chief Ibanga Bassey Etan Director Finance (EDF).  “We are solidly behind them because these are the kind of persons that are credible to change the lives of the rural communities in the Niger Delta region and we are going to support you to any length in order for you to succeed,” they said.
