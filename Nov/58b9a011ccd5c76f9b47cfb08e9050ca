Niger Delta Dev e l o p m e n t Commission (NDDC) Acting Executive Director Projects, Dr. Cairo Ojougboh yesterday directed all contractors handling NDDC projects to return to sites or be ready to face the consequences. Ojougboh, who gave the directive while addressing newsmen, said this had become necessary following President Muhammadu Buhari administration’s avowed commitment to ensure that the Niger Delta Social Economic Development nerve centres were adequately connected by a network of quality and long-lasting sustainable projects. He said the Federal Government’s policy drive was to ensure that all public funds channeled into infrastructural development, were judiciously accounted for, adding that as a result of this that President Buhari ordered a forensic audit of the NDDC and subsequent inauguration of Interim Management Committee to oversee the commission while the audit lasts. According to him, the three-member Interim Management Committee would not fold its arms and watch its efforts being sabotaged by any contractor, who attempts to cut corners rather than stick to acceptable standards and specifications. Ojougboh added: “The ongoing efforts to expand lasting projects in the region have been due largely to the deliberate efforts of Federal Government to aggressively tackle the rot and infrastructural deficiency across the Niger Delta region, with a view to ensuring that no part of it is left behind.” He, however, assured the people of the region that all projects embarked upon by the Commission would be completed, even as he commended them for their unflinching support to the Interim Management Committee and in drawing government’s attention to the lapses witnessed by the commission in recent times. This was as Ojougboh reiterated that the task of developing the region remained a collective responsibility of all the people.
