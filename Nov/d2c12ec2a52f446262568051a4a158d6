T he National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to act quickly on the Abuja High Court ruling, which disqualified the deputy governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bishop Degi in the Saturday governorship election in Beyelsa State.   Secondus, in a statement by his Media Adviser, Ike Abonyi, said the electoral umpire should invoke the relevant sections of the Constitution and the Electoral Act to disqualify the APC candidate.   According to him, what the court ruling meant was that APC has no validly nominated candidate for the November 16 governorship election.  As the stage is set for the election, the PDP National Chairman, therefore, called on the military and other security agencies to show high level of professionalism in the Saturdayâ€™s governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa States respectively.
