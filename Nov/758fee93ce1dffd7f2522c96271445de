The Senator representing Ogun Central, Ibikunle Amosun, has debunked reports that he was interested in running for Presidency in the 2023 elections. Amosun, who is the immediate past governor of Ogun State, said posters and publications purporting his 2023 presidential ambition are “nothing but sheer distraction.” This was contained in a statement made available to reporters on Thursday in Abeokuta, which was signed by Alhaji Bola Adeyemi for the Senator Ibikunle Amosun Media Office. He said as a member of the upper chamber of the National Assembly, his hands are full, adding that he was committed to working with fellow patriots on how best to move the nation forward. The former governor also took a swipe at persons nursing presidential ambition at a time President Muhammadu Buhari had just begun to consolidate on the successes of his first term. According to him, such persons are enemies of the Nigerian state and do not desire any good for Buhari. Amosun said: “My attention has just been drawn to a poster, suggesting I had thrown my hat into the 2023 Presidential race. “It definitely belies logic that such a move would be my preoccupation or in any way linked to me, when indeed I have not spent a year in my current assignment as the Senator representing Ogun Central District. “It goes without saying that anyone nursing a presidential ambition at a time President Muhammadu Buhari has just begun to consolidate on the successes of his first term, is not only an enemy of the Nigerian State, but clearly does not desire any good for Mr President. “The poster and any of such publication is nothing but sheer distraction. As a Senator, my hands are full and I am committed to working with fellow patriots on how best to move our nation forward by supporting and working with President Buhari. “There is a time for everything. The time to address 2023 is clearly not anywhere close.”
