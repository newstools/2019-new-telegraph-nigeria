Downstream oil major, OVH Energy Marketing Limited, on Wednesday declared that it had sacked two of its major dealers, sounding note of warning to others. The Chief Executive Officer of OVH, Huub Stokman, who declared this on the side lines of a media briefing at the company’s office in Apapa, Lagos, maintained that the dealers were sack based on their violation of OVH’s firm stand against profiteering and cheating of customers. “We released two dealers over cheating. We found out, we kicked them out,” he said, adding: “We will not pretend about it. We abhor cheating of our customers and with us they will always be in a safe hand.” Noting that his company had surged investment in key areas of business like jetty and loading gantry, quality control, OVH academy and aviation, Stokman maintained that the war on cheating of customers is also taken seriously. “If you keep doing the same thing over the time, you will keep having same result. When you desire improvement, you need to look at an improved way of doing the same thing. “We invested in new equipment to guarantee efficiency. We also upgraded 50 of our retail sites. We have done a lot also on our lube bays. All of this is to give our customers a new exciting experience,” he said.
