…Says Reps will work against Senate A member of the House of Representatives representing Jos south/Jos East Federal Constituency of Plateau State, Hon. Dachung Musa Bagos (PDP) has said the proposed Hate Speech and Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation Bill will not see the light of the day in the lower chamber.
Bagos, who disclosed this shortly after presenting a petition from his constituents to the senator representing Jos south senatorial district, Senator I.D. Gyang rejecting the proposed legislation.
He said it will be better if the senate does not transmit the bill to the House saying members of the House are mobilising to kill the bill as soon as it comes to the lower chamber.
The lawmaker said: “On behalf of the good and peaceful people of Jos South/Jos East Federal Constituency, I humbly write in view of the above subject matter, having received series of complaints and objections via text messages, calls, emails, WhatsApp messages and direct contact with some of my constituents who are aggrieved and had to express their concerns over the Hate Speech and Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation Bills currently undergoing passage into law by the Senate, Federal Republic of Nigeria.”
He said: “The views expressed by my constituents, many Nigerian citizens and even foreign nationals who have reached me all voiced out against the passage of the two bills.
“The views so expressed align with my thoughts and position as the Honourable Member, Representing Jos South/Jos East Federal Constituency, Plateau State. More so that there are extant laws in our Jurisprudence and under the Law of Tort like the Defamation of Character, Libel and Slander, that addresses the concerns raised by the two bills.”
