The Forum of State Chairmen of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has thrown its weight behind their National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole in the face off with the Director-General of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Mr. Salihu Lukman, who is calling for his resignation.
The Forum in a statement issued in Abuja Thursday and jointly signed by its Chairman, Ali Bukar Dalori and Secretary, Mr. Ben Nwoye, told the APC governors to sack Lukman from his position as the Director-General of the Progressive Governors Forum.
The APC state chairmen said they are satisfied with the leadership of the current National Working Committee (NWC) led by Oshiomhole.
The statement reads in part: “The attention of state chairmen of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has been drawn to a statement credited to one Salihu Lukman, who claimed to be the Director-General of the Progressives Governors Forum.
“We have decided to ignore his crass display of ignorance in the past, but as stakeholders in the progressive party, we find his actions and comments very suspicious and one that cannot be said that is coming from anyone close to the APC family.
“The position of the National Chairman of our great party is not a child’s play and we cannot allow it to be demeaned by questionable characters like Salihu Lukman who as it seems is being used by some disgruntled elements and even the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with a view to causing disaffection in our great party and we cannot continue to condone that.”
