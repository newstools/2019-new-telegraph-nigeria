Ex-international Sam Sodje has said the Super Eagles Manager Gernot Rohr still has a lot of work to do on his team following their performance in their 2-1 win over Benin Republic in a 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifying match on Wednesday. The former West Brom of England defender told our correspondent after the game that the team struggled in all departments and lacked cohesion in the encounter. He said although there were no minnows in African football anymore, the Eagles should have asserted their authority on their opponents with their performance. “Of course the team needs to improve in so many areas; it is difficult to mention a particular department but they need to play more as a team. We saw that there were no enough communication and cohesion and they were generally scrappy but I am sure the coach has noticed some of the mistakes and will work on them going forward,” he said. However, the former Reading star hailed the players’ mentality, praising them for coming from behind to record the victory. “We didn’t start the game very well but credit must be given to the team for overcoming that setback to record victory. In football, result is what that is matter not the way you play and it is good that they were able to defeat Benin Republic today,’ he said.
