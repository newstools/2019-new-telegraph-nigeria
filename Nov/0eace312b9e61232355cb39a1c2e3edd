The Onne Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has intensified actions to ensure that goods cleared at the port would undergo proper documentation procedures. Its Area Controller, Comptroller Galadima Saidu has assigned a dedicated team of Customs operatives to do necessary due diligence to ensure that goods arriving through the port were properly documented. The Area Controller on assuming duty a few months ago had warned officers and men of the command that there would be no room for arbitrary violation of established procedures and processes under his command. He had stressed that the federal government’s law on import documentation must be carried out to the letter. Consequently, officers and men of the Federal Ocean Terminal (FOT) gate, Onne, of the Nigerian Customs Service appear to have tightened the exit corridors in keeping with international best practices in import documentation at the exit gate, thereby generating more revenue to the Federal Government. This, however, was not without a price or sacrifice among the men and officers of the Nigerian Customs Service as their firm stance had pitched them against some agents and touts. Leader of the Transparency Group of the Customs Licensed Agents, Chief Jerry Obichere, while commending the Onne Customs for keeping with the rules of engagement in international documentation procedures at the Port, advised importers and agents operating at the port to look beyond personal gains and align with public and national interest as represented by the Customs documentation policy. “At the port today, import goods are undergoing physical examination before final exit at the FOT gate and this procedure is jeopardizing the plans of agents and touts bent on cutting corners,” he said.
