Justice Abiola Soladoye of an Ikeja Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Court, Lagos Monday told a widow, whose 19-year-old son was accused of sodomizing a minor, to mentor her son in order for him to desist from such acts.
The 19-year-old, Chinedu Ezebuka, was docked for allegedly sodomising a 13-year-old secondary school student (name withheld).
Ezebuka, a mechanic, was arraigned on March 25 on a one-count charge of sexual assault by penetration contrary to Section 261 of the Criminal Law of Lagos 2015.
According to the State Prosecutor, Mrs Arinola Momoh-Ayokanbi, the defendant committed the offence at 8pm on January 9,  2018 at Akinwunmi Street, Ikeja.
“He sexually assaulted the minor by penetrating him through the anus.
“The mechanic was allegedly caught in the act of defiling the minor by a member of the public who reported the offence to authorities,” Momoh-Ayokanbi said.
However, Justice Soladoye admonished the mother of the accused after the prosecutor told the court that the parents of the complainant and other witnesses were no longer interested in pursuing the case.
The judge, addressing the widow, said: “You need to talk to your son, pray with him, guide him and spend quality time with him. God is a God of second chances.
“Get your church involved, get an elderly person in your neighbourhood to also mentor him. You cannot abandon him, for he is your tomorrow.”
