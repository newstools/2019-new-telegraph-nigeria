Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Saturday’s rerun election in Kogi West, Senator Dino Malaye, has called for the postponement of the exercise. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed November 30 for the supplementary election in areas where the election did not hold due to violence. But Melaye, who visited the headquarters of the Commission for the second time since the November 16 election, said the shift would enable INEC to address what he described as “noticed infractions in the November 16 election and concerns over areas where the supplementary election would be held.” He had earlier submitted a petition calling for total cancellation of the election, which he supported with attached 21 video CDs and documentary evidence to prove that there was no election in Kogi West. Melaye said he was also at INEC headquarters to submit additional facts to those in his early petition, which he believe were unknown to INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu. “What is new in what we have submitted today is that we have attached a copy of form EC8B of ward A in Lokoja Local Government Area where INEC during collation cancelled results of nine out of 23 Polling Units in the LGA,” he explained.
