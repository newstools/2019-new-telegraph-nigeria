T he Anambra State Police Command yesterday said it has discovered a decomposing body of a man in his apartment in Awka.  The Anambra State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), a Superintendent of Police (SP), Mohammed Haruna, disclosed this in a statement. He noted that the man was believed to have died of natural causes in the apartment where he lived alone.   He said Mr. Duke Ezeonwuka, who lived in the Kawata area, where the decomposed body was discovered, reported to police on November 26, that one of the houses he managed had been locked from inside with occupant’s phone switched off.  The spokesman said Ezeonwuka gave the name of the occupant of the four-flat apartment as Dr Albert Gini, and that the man had rented the place for clinic and residency purposes.   Ezeonwuka thought the man had travelled to Brazil as usual since September when he last saw him, but was however taken aback by an unusual odour oozing out from one of the rooms in the upper floor. Ezeonwuka said this prompted him to call on neighbours, who assisted him to open the window, where they saw the decomposed body in the room.   Haruna said police detectives from ‘B’ Division Awka led by the DPO visited the scene and confirmed the incident. He said the deceased`s Gionee cell phone, which was plugged for charging was recovered and photographs taken.   According to him, no implement of violence was seen or observed, and thus, no foul play suspected from a critical analysis of the crime scene.  He further noted that the relatives of the deceased have been contacted and arrangements on going to evacuate the remains for autopsy and prevent disease outbreak in the vicinity.
