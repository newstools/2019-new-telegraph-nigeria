President Church of Christ in Nations Rev. Dr. Dachollom Datiri has described the delay in the resettlement of Internally Displaced Persons in the state as a failure on the part of Governor Simon Lalong’s administration. Datiri said this on Tuesday during the Opening Ceremony of the 97th General Church Council at the Headquarters Church, Jos Plateau State. According to him, despite promises by the Plateau State government a year ago, their resettlement still remains a mirage. “We must tell government the truth and say that the Plateau State government has failed us in her responsibility of resettlement of the IDPs “Government has failed us and IDPs continue to languish in their woes, despite promises by the Plateau State government a year ago. They are victims of man’s inhumanity to man that occurred in many parts of Plateau State last year and especially in Barkin Ladi LGC,” he said. The clergy said the situation of the IDPs is made worst by the fact that spirited individuals and NGOs that used to offer assistance have all grown tired and the assistance has dried up. The COCIN President, also in his speech, said attacks on communities had continued unabated and accused government of doing nothing to stop it.
