Victor Osimhen scored twice as the Super Eagles defeated Lesotho 4-2 in 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifiers Match Day 2 tie at the Setsoto stadium on Sunday.   Alex Iwobi and Samuel Chukwueze were also on score sheet for Nigeria while Chidozie Awaziem conceded an own goal.   Manager Gernot Rohr made two changes to the starting line-up that beat Benin Republic in Uyo five days ago, with Moses Simon and Awaziem coming into the side at the expense of Samuel Kalu and Jamilu Collins respectively.   Lesotho took the lead against the run of play when Masoabi Nkoto took advantage of some lax Nigeria defending to put the hosts ahead after eleven minutes following a cross from the left channel.   But the lead would only last till the 26th minute when Osimhen led the Super Eagles press, charging down the right to set up Iwobi who slotted home from close range.   The duo of Chukwueze and Osimhen looked particularly dangerous on the break and alongside Simon, who tested goalkeeper Ntsane Lichaba with a ferocious drive from a free-kick.   On the 36th minute, Osimhen was at it again when he found space to ping in a lob which Chukwueze got on the end of to beat Lichaba with a good header.   The Lille striker was proving too difficult to handle for The Crocodiles, as he would yet threaten after the break when he rattled the cross bar with a shot.   He will then get his goal deep into the game when Ola Aina broke free from the right flank to play him in for a neat finish and take the game to 3-1.   Osimhen made it 4-1 on the 84th minute mark when impressive second half substitute Ramon Azeez shrugged off his marker to find the long-limbed front man who rounded Lichaba to grab his brace as Nigeria looked all but set to close out 2019 in style.
