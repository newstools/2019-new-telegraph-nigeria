President of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR), Mallam Mukhtar Sirajo, on Thursday, stressed the need to build strong institutions towards strengthening and improving the nation’s democracy.
Sirajo, who spoke in Abeokuta at the 2019 annual colloquium of the Ogun State chapter of NIPR, bemoaned the spate of impunity in governance and public sector, saying such was gradually weakening the nation’s institutions.
At the event with the theme, “Strengthening Nigeria’s social institutions: The PR dimensions,” the state’s Deputy Governor, Engr Noimot Salako-Oyedele, advocated the imperative of public relations in achieving good governance in the country.
Discussants at the colloquium included the state commandant of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Hammed Abodurin; Eddy Aina, Kola Olugbodi and Akin Okudero, among others.
Sirajo, in his address read by the NIPR Registrar, Kayode Yeku, said Nigeria requires visionary leaders and not strong men to build democratic institutions that would outlast generations.
According to him, the country and other African nations remain where they were today because strong men ruled their weak institutions.
He said: “Only visionary leaders and not strong men are able to build democratic institutions that would outlast generations. Africa is where it is today because strong men ruled its weak institutions.
“For example, in a presidential system of democracy, it is essential that the judicial, legislative and executive arms of government work hand in hand, albeit independent of one another.
“Nigeria requires capable, reliable, efficient and transparent institutions; strong and viable legislature, honest police force, independent judges, an independent press, a vibrant private sector and a civil society to give life to our democracy.”
