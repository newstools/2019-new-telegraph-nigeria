An Ikeja High Court, Lagos on Friday admitted in evidence the confessional statement made by two gang members of an alleged kidnap kingpin, Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike, alias Evans, to the police. Justice Hakeem Oshodi ruled on the issue of voluntariness and admissibility of the confessional statements made by the 4th and 6th defendants after hearing submissions and final written addresses of both the defence and prosecution counsels. Evans is standing trial alongside five accomplices; Uche Amadi, Okechukwu Nwachukwu, Chilaka Ifeanyi, Victor Chukwunonso Aduba and a woman, Ogechi Uchechukwu on a two-count charge of conspiracy and kidnapping. The six were arraigned on August 30, 2017 for the alleged kidnap of the Chief Executive Officer of Maydon Pharmaceutical Limited, Donatus Dunu, from whose family they allegedly collected the sum of 223,000 euros (N100million) as ransom. The judge, in his ruling, said that there was no evidence before the court to prove that the defendants were tortured during the process of obtaining their statements by the police.
