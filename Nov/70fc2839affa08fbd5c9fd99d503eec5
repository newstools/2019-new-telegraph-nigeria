Nigeria U-23 coach Imama Amapakabo has said his side were unlucky to crash out of the ongoing CAF U-23 African Cup of Nations in the group stage, missing the Tokyo 2020 Olympics Games ticket.  The team played a goalless draw with South Africa in Cairo on Friday which was not enough for them to progress to the semifinal of the U-23 AFCON putting the coach under intense criticism.  “We were unlucky and unfortunate to go out because we gave everything, but it’s totally out of my hands,” he told BBC.  “I know that, as a coach, you come under pressure. We have to look at the future – this [Olympic hopes] has ended, whichever way we want to look at it.”   Africa’s most successful side at the Games, Nigeria went out of the U-23 Africa Cup of Nations on Friday with questions raised about Amapakabo’s future following the country’s poor results under his watch.  The Super Eagles B side failed to qualify for the 2020 African Nations Championship (CHAN) and his team also suffered an embarrassing early exit at the regional WAFU Cup tournament in October.  Amapakabo is aware that his position has become untenable following his recent failure, but said that it is up to his employers to make a decision on his future.   “I can’t say anything now because it all depends on what the federation wants in terms of going forward.” he added.  Nigeria – bronze medallists at Rio 2016 – won the 1996 Olympic football tournament and are the first African country to complete an Olympic medal sweep having won a sliver medal in Beijing in 2008.
