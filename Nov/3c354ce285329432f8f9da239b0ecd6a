Former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olabode George has said he would continue to work for the unity of this country regardless of the attacks against his position. This is just as the former Military Governor of Ondo State charged the younger generation to strive towards uniting the country, adding that though the older generation tried to unite the country without telling the youth that they can succeed. George spoke on Saturday when the Northern Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) conferred him with the award of Garkuwan Matasan Najeriya (Philanthropist Per Excellence). According to him, the older generation made the “small mistake” of trying to be honest with each other in a bid to unite the country. He said: “I want to appeal to the younger generation.  We, the older ones, have made small mistake and that is the mistake of trying to be honest with ourselves and unite this country. We have not succeeded. “But I plead with you, you can succeed. There are no differences. Yes there are cultural differences but who chose where he is to be born. God decided where you would be born. You don’t know where you will go in the next round, you can’t determine that.” Recalling that his best friend is a Northerner, he advised those fanning embers of disunity for selfish gains to remember that power is transient.
