      The Bayelsa State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has urged the people of the state not be deterred by Thursday’s judgement by the Bayelsa State High Court disqualifying the candidature of David Lyon. Reacting to the judgement, which was delivered by Justice Jane Inyang, the alternate Director General of the David Lyon Campaign Organisation, Professor Seiyefa Brisibe said that the judgment does not hold water and therefore should be disregarded. Addressing the media in Yenagoa, the state capital on Thursday, Brisibe urged the people not to panic saying that it has appealed the judgment while filing for stay of execution of the ruling. He noted that the governorship candidate, David Lyon and his running mate, Degi Eremienyo were fully on the ballot for the election adding that Bayelans should not listen to rumours,. “Our opponents are actually jittery because of the acceptance of our candidate because testimonies abound. “Because of their jittery nature, people will want to do anything that will scuttle the peace of the state. “Everyone that desires the peace of the state should not worry. Your preferred candidate and his deputy are squarely on the ballot. “We have done everything procedurally to make sure that the judgement doesn’t stand. Come out en masse and vote for APC,” the alternate DG said.
