The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) will on December 11, re-arraign a former Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Hon, Adeyemi Ikuforiji and his aide, Oyebode Atoyebi, for alleged laundering of N500 million at a Federal High Court in Lagos. The duo are to stand trial on a 56-count charge bordering on the alleged offence before Justice Mohammed Liman. Justice Liman fixed the date on Wednesday upon a request by the defence lawyer, Tunde Akinrinmisi, for an adjournment of the matter to allow for proper service of the charge on his clients. The lawyer told the court that he received a hearing notice as one of the lawyers who represented the defendants and it was out of “utmost respect for the court” that he came to court on Wednesday. He prayed the judge to grant an adjournment for him to get in touch with the defendants who were absent at Wednesday’s proceedings. Responding, EFCC’s lawyer, Rotimi Oyedepo, expressed his reservations about Akinrinmisi’s request saying the case has suffered series of adjournments in the past. He alleged that the charge has been served on the defendants when the trial started some years ago. “This is a case that the prosecution has given evidence and closed its case but Justice Ibrahim Buba discharged the defendants on no-case submission, which travelled from here up to the Supreme Court. Here we are six years after,” Oyedepo said.
