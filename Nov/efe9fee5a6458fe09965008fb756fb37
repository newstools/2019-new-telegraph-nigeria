The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and the United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) have concluded arrangement to sign a $1.16 million grant as part funding for the NNPC-Abuja Independent Power Project (IPP). The corporation disclosed this in a statement by Mr. Samson Makoji, Acting spokesman for NNPC, in Abuja yesterday. He said that the arrangement was the outcome of a business meeting between the Management of NNPC and the USTDA at the NNPC Towers. Makoji noted that both parties agreed to close out the deal on December 1, adding that the IPP was modeled to generate 1,350 megawatts of electricity to alleviate the power challenge in the country. The Group Managing Director of NNPC, Malam Mele Kyari, said that the plan by the corporation to build the 1,350MW power plant in Abuja was part of the national strategy to monetize the abundant natural gas resources in the country. He added that the USDTA grant was to complement the ongoing feed project in order to make the Abuja IPP initiative more bankable for strategic investors’ participation. “As a state-owned oil company and enabler organisation, we know that our investment in the Abuja 1,350mw IPP will increase energy supply level with great impact on the nation’s economy. “Therefore, the USTDA grant is timely to make it a bankable project that would attract foreign direct investment into the country,” he said.
