Protests by various communities in Zungeru, Niger State on Thursday has led to the cancellation of the visit to the Zungeru Hydro Power Dam by the Minister of Power, Saleh Mamman.
The over two thousand protesters, led by the State Youth Leader, Comrade Bello B. Shariff, blocked the Zungeru-Kontagora road as early as 10am demanding for the rehabilitation and construction of roads in all parts of the state especially the roads leading to Zungeru.
It was reliably learnt that the Minister, who was supposed to visit the dam, cancelled the trip after getting feelers that the communities were protesting.
The state government, led by the Deputy Governor Ahmed Mohammed Ketso, arrived Zungeru without the Minister.
Speaking during the protest, Shariff said all the communities surrounding the Zungeru Hydro Dam in Zungeru town in Wushishi Local Government of Niger State were involved.
“We appreciate the commitment of His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR) towards the completion of the Zungeru Dam project inherited from his predecessor having considered its economic and social violability to the state, and Nigeria,” he said.
He further stated that the communities are aware that the financing facility for the construction of the Zungeru Dam is to cover for the rebuilding and as well converting them to reinforced concrete highways for these major route – Bida – Lemu – Wushishi Zungeru and Zungeru-Tegina – Kontagora Road to withstand the conveying of heavy equipment to the dam site.
