  Jubilation over the declaration of Governor Yahaya Bello as Kogi State governor-elect for second term, on Monday turned bloody at Achadamu community in Ofu Local Government Area, as blood thirsty thugs set ablaze a 60-year-old woman, Mrs Acheju Abuh in her home. The thugs it was learnt were celebrating the victory of Yahaya Bello at last Saturday’s election in the state, when they moved to the late Mrs Abuh home, locked her inside the house and set it on fire. The victim, Mrs Acheju Abuh, was the Women Leader of Wada Aro Campaign Council, Ochadamu Ward. Reacting to the banal act, the spokesman, Wada/Aro Campaign Council, Faruk Adejoh-Audu said: “The jubilant thugs were Chanting GYB 4+4, the thugs, shooting sporadically, arrived Hon (Mrs) Abuh’s house at about 2pm this afternoon (on Monday) and surrounded the house, bolting every exit and escape from outside. “They then poured petrol on the building and set it ablaze as other terrorized villagers watched from hiding. She reportedly attempted to escape through a window but was prevented by the metal burglary proof and gun shots with bullets raining in her direction. “The blood-thirsty thugs waited, shooting and watching with relish while Mrs Abuh cried from inside the inferno until her voice died out. “They reportedly left only when the entire house and Mrs Abuh had been burnt to ashes. There are fears that the killing spree may escalate. “We are calling on all men of good conscience to immediately help the people of Kogi State appeal to the Inspector General of Police to rein in Bello’s thugs and protect our people whose only crime was that they voted for their choice, a vote that was never allowed to count.” Meanwhile, the Kogi State Police Command confirmed the incident through its Public Relations Office, DSP William Aya.
