Hundreds of retired staff of the Nigeria Bottling Company, (NBC) in Benue State on Monday barricaded the entrance into the company in protest over non-payment of their entitlements.
The retirees, who specifically worked in Coca Cola company, blocked the gate of the Coca Cola depot in Makurdi, preventing vehicles from entering and leaving.
The visibly angry looking retirees vowed to remain on the gate and keep it sealed indefinitely until their demands are met.
Leader of the protesters, Mr. Vincent  Shagbaor told journalists that they decided to stage the protest after several failed attempts to prevail on the company to pay them their own benefits.
Shagbaor confirmed that the situation with their colleagues from other states is different as their benefits have been cleared and wondered why the situation in Benue remains unattended to.
“We are here because NBC has refused to hear our calls demanding for our payments.
“We have gathered as a body and want to fight a common course, a course of liberating our people and trying to get our refunds from Nigeria Bottling Company.
“We were engaged by law and enrolled in insurance scheme  with Crusader Insurance Company Nigeria Limited
“But for over 13 years, that we have been disengaged they have refused to pay our members what is due for them,  that is why we are protesting
“We have some contribution with other companies, but what we are now pressing for is that insurance refunds,” he said.
