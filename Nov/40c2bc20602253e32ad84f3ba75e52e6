The APC has commended the various security agencies over their respective roles during Saturday’s governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states. This is as the party called on its supporters to remain calm as they await the full results of the elections.   APC, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, said: “We are aware of several hoodlums brought into Kogi State from Osun and Oyo states few days before the elections, just as we monitored the grand preparation to unleash violence in Bayelsa State. “We are delighted that the forces of darkness have failed. The subterfuge deployed by the PDP to rig the election in both states, including the Kogi West senatorial rerun election was thwarted.”
