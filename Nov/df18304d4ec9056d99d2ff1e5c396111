Nollywood actress, Halima Abubakar says her father used to check regularly to confirm that she was still a virgin while growing up.    She made this known via her Instagram page recently while reacting to American rapper, T.I’s statement on checking his daughter’s virginity status regularly. According to the movie star, it is not a bad thing for a parent to check their daughter’s virginity.   “I don’t see anything wrong in checking if your daughter is still a virgin. I remember my dad taking me to see different doctors; just to be sure. He stopped after three times. I hated him then a bit but he is just a father trying to protect his stubborn daughter.”   She said this in defense of the rapper, T.I’s statement about taking his daughter to the hospital regularly to check if she is still a virgin and this got everyone talking.   T.I. says he’s simply exercising his right as a parent to steer his daughter away from what he considers bad decisions.
