At least 28 million Nigerians are living with the Hepatitis B virus, with more than half of the number unaware of their medical condition.
A Professor of Gastroentorology/Hepatology at the Bayero University, Kano,
Adamu Alhaji Samaila, made the frightening revelation Friday, at an awareness lecture and screening excercise for Hepatitis B virus, which held at the headquarters of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) in Abuja. It was organised by the medical branch of the Service.
The lecture was approved by the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, as part of measures to ensure that Hepatitis and other similar diseases do not pose a challenge to the NAF’s operational readiness.
In his presentation, the guest lecturer said: “About 28 million Nigerians are suffering from Hepatitis B.
“Over 2 billion (global figure) individuals have evidence of previous and present infection. 240 million chronic carriers. 1 million deaths annually.”
Accordingly, Samaila called for screening and testing, saying doing so will facilitate early detection and treatment, where necessary.
In his opening remarks, the CAS maintained that, beyond the deployment of platforms for battles, there was the compelling need personnel to be mentally and physically fit.
