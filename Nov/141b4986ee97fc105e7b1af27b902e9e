Scotland Yard has unleashed a new weapon in the fight against computer crime — two springer spaniels trained to sniff out mobile phones, laptops and even SIM cards. Police dogs Bolly and Murphy’s super-sensitive noses can uncover data storage devices missed during the most meticulous fingertip searches by their human counterparts. During a pilot project, Bolly used her incredible sense of smell to locate a paedophile’s laptop — hidden in a secret compartment in a dinner tray and wedged down the side of a bed, reports standard.co.uk.
Another suspect tried to hide a tiny SIM card behind laminate floor beading in his home. A sex offender, trying to conceal his camera disguised as a torch, was caught out when a dog detected the device’s SD memory card in a box of rubbish previously searched by local officers. The Met is now deploying digital media detection dogs in counter terrorism, robbery and murder cases to retrieve phones, computers, USB sticks and hard drives.
English springer spaniel Bolly was bred at the Metropolitan police dog unit training base at Keston in Bromley.
