There are indications that organisers of the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon will on Wednesday (November 27) stage a world press conference to unveil plans for the 2020 edition of the annual race. It was gathered that the press parley which is expected to take place at Bagauda Kaltho Hall in Alausa, Ikeja will officially detail the innovations in place for the 5th edition of the international race. The Access Bank Lagos City Marathon was recently upgraded by the world athletics body to a Silver Label; less than five years after its maiden edition. The annual race is unarguably the biggest one-day event in Africa from its inception in 2015 and it has been organized according to the standard of IAAF, the world governing body for athletics. In an interview with Olukayode Thomas, Head Communications and Media for the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon, he revealed that arrangements are in top gear to have another spectacular race for 2020. “Yes, we will be having a presence conference on Wednesday but strictly based on invitation to intimate the media on our plans for the 2020 Access Bank Lagos City Marathon,” he said. “It is always important to carry the media along in our plans as they have been our partners right from the first edition up until now” From the over 50,000 participants that took part in the first edition of the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon, over 100,000 took part in the most recent edition that took place in February 2019 and much more are expected for the 2020 race.
