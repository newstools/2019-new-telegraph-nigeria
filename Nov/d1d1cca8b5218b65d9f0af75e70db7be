The candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for this weekend’s governorship election in Kogi State, Engr. Musa Wada, has urged the people of the state not to be deterred by threats of violence and come out to vote. He gave the charge yesterday at a rally in Ayingba, Dekina Local Government Area of the state. Attributing the huge crowd at the rally to the people’s determination to vote out the APC-led government in the state, Wada said: “Nobody gave you one naira to come here. You are here because of interest, determination and desire to end maladministration, poverty, lack of salary payment and development decay that characterized the APC government in Kogi State. “I want to assure you that your sacrifice to liberate the state will not go unnoticed because my first priority as governor, if Allah permits, will be total human and physical development. “I want enter into covenant with you that I will not compromise in the provision in my ‘rescue mission’ agenda as I will review all the injustice done to you by the present APC government in Kogi State.” Wada, who assured the people and the electorate that their votes will count, called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), police and other security agencies to be professional in the discharge of their duties before, during and after the election.
