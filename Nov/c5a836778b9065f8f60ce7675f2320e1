MAKURDI Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom on Wednesday threw his support behind a fresh electoral reform which has mandated the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to adopt the electronic voting (e-voting) system for future polls. A Bill to amend the Electoral Act 2010 and to make provision for electronic database into which all results in an election should be transmitted directly from polling units to a Central Database had already scaled through second reading at the National Assembly.
Ortom believes that amending the electoral law to accommodate the e-voting system would give birth to a more credible, violence-free, free and fair election in the country. The governor conveyed his feeling while speaking at the occasion of High Level Consultation on Promoting Social Cohesion in the aftermath of the general elections Benue State organised by the INECin collaboration with United Nations and National Peace held in Makurdi, the state capital. He emphasized that it was plausible for the country to embrace the system since the government has introduced e-governance in most of her activities, stressing that government needs to enfold  modern technological developments as the days when analogue systems and approaches to doing things were adopted has been consigned into history.
