A Swedish appeals court has found former Nigeria international Dickson Etuhu guilty for attempted match-fixing. The Court of Appeals in Stockholm said in a release on Wednesday said that it was clear that Etuhu and an unnamed former player tried to influence AIK keeper Kyriakos “Kenny” Stamatopoulos to fix a match in Sweden’s top division in 2017, reports the BBC. Etuhu, who played for several English clubs including Manchester City, Sunderland and Fulham, escaped a jail sentence but was instead fined and sentenced to serve probation, without further details being made public. The 37-year-old, who left AIK Solna in 2016, says he will be appealing against the ruling at the Supreme Court. The court said that “the content of what the men submitted to the player (Stamatopoulos) was so clear that it should be considered a criminal offer of bribe.” Etuhu had intially been acquitted by a court last year but that was appealed by prosecutor Johan Lindmark, who told local Swedish newspaper ‘Expressen’ that he was satisfied with today’s outcome. “It was with satisfaction that I received the verdict today,” Lindmark said. “I had appealed on the grounds that I thought the court of law would change and was not surprised when I saw the verdict.” Etuhu played 20 times for the Super Eagles including at two Africa Cup of Nations in 2008 and 2010 as well as the World Cup in South Africa.
