Fresh indications emerged on Thursday that the embattled lecturer at the Federal Polytechnic, Offa, Mustapha Ilyas Abdulwasiu would be re-arraigned by the Ilorin Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission ( EFCC).
The Commission had last week Tuesday arraigned the defendant before Justice Sikiru Oyinloye of a Kwara State High Court sitting in Ilorin on a nine-count charge bordering on employment scam and obtaining money under false pretence.
Count one of the charge stated: “That you Mustapha Ilyas Abdulwasiu between June and July 2018 at Offa, within the jurisdiction of this honourable Court with intent to defraud obtained the sum of N600,000 from one Amubiaya Raphael Oluwafemi by false pretence that you were in charge of employment at the Federal Polytechnic,  Offa and obtained the money for the purpose of securing employment for the said Amubiaya Raphael Oluwafemi and his wife,  Amubiaya Remi Janet which representation you knew to be false and thereby committed an offence contrary to section 1(3) of the Advance Fee Fraud and other Fraud Related Offences Act, No. 14, 2006.”
While Count nine of the charge stated: “That you,  Mustapha Ilyas Abdulwasiu  between December,  2018 and February 2019 at Offa within the jurisdiction of this honourable Court with intent to defraud obtained the sum of N550,000 from one Mustapha Kabir by false pretence that you were in charge of employment at the Federal Polytechnic,  Offa and you obtained the money for the purpose of securing employment for the said Mustapha Kabir and his wife,  Jimoh Ganiyatu which representation you knew to be false and thereby committed an offence contrary to section 1 (3) of the Advance Fee Fraud and other Fraud Related Offences Act,  No 14 , 2006.”
But the story took another twist on Tuesday when the Counsel to the embattled lecturer, Basir Oladipo told the Presiding Judge that the accused was making moves to settle with both the complainants and the prosecution.
