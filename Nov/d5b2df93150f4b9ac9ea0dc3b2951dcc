The three Indiana judges who were involved in a brawl in Indianapolis that left two of them shot have been temporarily suspended by the Indiana Supreme Court. The state Supreme Court handed down the order Tuesday, writing in its ruling that the actions of Clark County Judges Andrew Adams and Bradley Jacobs and Crawford County Judge Sabrina Bell “were not merely embarrassing on a personal level … they discredited the entire Indiana judiciary,” the Washington Post reported. The order states that all three judges were intoxicated and “behaving in an injudicious manner” during the May 1 incident in a White Castle parking lot. Jacobs and Adams were shot following a scuffle with strangers in the lot — about a half-mile from the state Capitol — after a night of bar-hopping, reports the New York Post. Adams and two other men were charged in connection with the fight. Under the order of the Indiana Supreme Court, Adams will serve a 60-day unpaid suspension ending January 12, and Jacobs and Bell will serve 30-day unpaid suspensions ending December 22.
