A Special Offences (Mobile) Court at Oshodi on Tuesday convicted 37 individuals for various traffic violations.  The alleged traffic offenders were prosecuted by the Lagos State Attorney-General (AG) and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN).  Out of the 37 alleged traffic violators, 18 were charged for driving against traffic (one way), 12 for driving on the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor while seven others were motorcycle offenders. During the proceedings, the Magistrate of the Mobile Court, Mrs Omobola Salau handed out various sentences to the traffic offenders.  Some offenders were ordered to forfeit their vehicles to the LASG while fines ranging from N15,000 to N20,000 were handed out to the violators. Offenders were also ordered to serve community service ranging from 100 hours to 25 hours.  The magistrate, while addressing the AG, said that there were no databases for traffic violations in the state.  “There are no databases for traffic offenders in Lagos State to ensure effective adjudication of these cases. “We will appreciate if the government of Lagos State looks into this problem,” she said.
