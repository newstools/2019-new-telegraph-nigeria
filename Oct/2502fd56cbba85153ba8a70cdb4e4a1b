Men of the underworld yesterday attacked a community in Gauraka in Tafa Local Government Area of Niger State, killed two persons and injured several others. The state House of Assembly Speaker, Hon Abdullahi Bawa Wuse, disclosed this while hosting the state Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), George Uwem Edem, in Minna. The speaker lamented the lack of security in most communities. He said: “In the raid of over three hours, no security was at hand to help the community.” Wuse added that the affected community was part of his constituency and he was called by the people after the robbers had completed their operations. He said: “The robbers stormed Gauraka community in the early hours of today (yesterday) about 3a.m., raided from house to house and attacked the people. Two people were killed. “It is not fair that there is no police station in this community. Even the outstation has only two policewomen and what could they have done in a situation like this?” Wuse stressed the need for security agencies to put in their best and assist the state to curb the rising insecurities. He added: “We cannot continue to lose lives resulting from banditry, kidnapping and robbery. The security situation in the state is getting out of hand and we need to find a way to address it. “We must stand up as a state to collectively fight this menace; we cannot continue to allow it to happen. Our people cannot continue to suffer and face these problems all the time.” The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Abubakar Muhammad, said the police were in control of the situation. He said: “Our men responded immediately after receiving a distress call. Unfortunately, the call did not come on time. “In the attack, two people died and some persons were harmed by the robbers. However, we want our people to contact the security on time.”
