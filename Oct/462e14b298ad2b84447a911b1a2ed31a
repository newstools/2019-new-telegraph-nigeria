E den Hazard scored his first goal for Real Madrid as Los Blancos extended their unbeaten start to the LaLiga season to eight games with a 3-2 win over Granada. Karim Benzema had given Madrid an early lead at the Bernabeu before Hazard found the net, for the first time since his Â£89million move from Chelsea, in first-half stoppage time. Luka Modric extended the advantage after the break before Darwin Machis pulled a goal back from the penalty spot. Domingos Duarte then scored again for the visitors with 12 minutes to make Madrid sweat but James Rodriguez made sure of victory three minutes into stoppage time.
