  •It’s a miracle — Community   Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has fulfilled his promise to upgrade the damaged Taiwo Road in Omu-Aran, headquarters of Irepodun Local Government Area from surface dressing to asphalt overlay, exactly one week after the governor attended the town’s annual get-together where appeals were made to fix the road. As at Saturday afternoon, the Kwara State Road Maintenance Agency (KWARMA) has started asphalt work on the road following approval and release of funds for the rehabilitation work. It would be recalled that at the Omu Aran Day 2019 held in the town on Saturday, the community called on AbdulRazaq to consider fixing the road, among other requests, while the governor promised to look into the request. Omu Aran Development Association (ODA) President Bisi Adeyemi called the development a “miracle”, hailing the speed with which the government acted on the issue. “That’s a great development. It is a miracle. It is a miracle because the governor promised something and within a week he’s doing exactly that. That is marvellous. He shows he’s a man of action. The community is highly appreciative and grateful to the governor for this,” Adeyemi said regarding the road work. The governor had also at the same event said his administration’s upcoming social investment programme was designed to fund small businesses, artisans, and lift many people out of the poverty bracket.
