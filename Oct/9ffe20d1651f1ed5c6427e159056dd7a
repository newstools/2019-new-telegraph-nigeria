At least eight people lost their lives in an auto accident involving two vehicles, a Starlet and a Toyota Corolla, in Yola, Adamawa. The accident occurred about 4p.m., on Wednesday, near Afcott Company, Ngurore in Yola South Local Government Area. A witness said the Starlet was trying to overtake a vehicle conveying corpse from Jada to Guyuk before it ran into the oncoming Toyota Corolla. The accident occurred at a dangerous bend shortly after Ngurore on Numan Road. It was learnt that the head of one of the female victims was severed from her body. Residents of the area said several lives had been lost in accidents which occurred on the spot. A few years ago, a bus belonging to the Adamawa State Chapter of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) crashed on the spot while on its way from Ganye to Guyuk. Wednesdays are the market days of Ngurore and traffic is usually very heavy. The state Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), Mohammed Hussaini, said the dead and those injured were evacuated to the Yola Specialist Hospital. nder Hussaini said the incident was as a result of reckless driving. He urged motorists to be cautious when driving and to obey road signs. Meanwhile, at the Yola Specialist Hospital, people were trooping in and out, trying to confirm if they could recognise any of the victims.
