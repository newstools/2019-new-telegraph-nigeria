Former governor of Ogun State, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, has expressed satisfaction with the leadership style of the incumbent governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, saying the state was progressing under him. Daniel, who downplayed the issue of non-appointment of commissioners by Abiodun after almost five months in power, declared that the governor “knows what he is doing.” He spoke on Tuesday night shortly after paying a courtesy visit to Abiodun at the Governor’s Office, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta. It was the first time since leaving office in 2011 that Daniel would visit the governor’s office. Fielding questions from reporters, the former governor said he was happy that Abiodun had sustained the momentum of governance. He submitted that the state requires a governor with Abiodun’s temperament, urging people of the state to encourage and support him. Daniel explained that he and the governor discussed several issues but ruled out any discussion on the issue of commissioners.
