The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), caucus in the House of Representatives have described as “illegal and unconstitutional”, the impeachment of the former Deputy Governor of Kogi State, Mr Simon Achuba. The lawmakers, in a statement released yesterday, said that the event leading to the purported impeachment of Achuba as deputy governor was “offensive, grotesque and embarrassing”, calling the entire impeachment process as “a hoax”. The statement reads in parts: ” We watched with very keen interest recent development surrounding the embattled deputy governor of Kogi state, His Excellency, Simon Achuba and we join several well-meaning Nigerians and democrats to condemn in very strong terms the purported impeachment of the deputy governor of Kogi State, which is not only baseless, but illegal, unconstitutional and a total debasement of all known democratic principles, due process and the rule of law, by members of the Kogi State House of Assembly in concert with the Kogi State government . “Recall that Mr Simon Achuba has for over a year been at cross purposes and had a running battle with the Kogi State Governor, Mr Yahaya Bello.
