B enue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, yesterday restated his call on the Federal Government to dredge River Benue to put a permanent end to perennial flooding in the state. The governor disclosed this to newsmen after he led other top government functionaries to carry out an on-the-spot assessment of flooded areas within Makurdi metropolis. Ortom, who lamented the magnitude of destruction the disaster caused the victims, regretted that past administrations in the country had awarded contracts for the dredging of the River, yet nothing was done to it.  “It is unfortunate that Nigeria is passing through very difficult economic progress, and I want to believe that if the Federal Government fulfils its promise by ensuring that the River Benue is dredged, the issue of flooding will become a thing of the past. “This is a programme that previous governments had awarded contracts and it is unfortunate that I cannot explain why up till now River Benue has not been dredged. “Now it is a shallow river and once there is excess rainfall or release of water from Lagdo Dam from Cameroon, you will see it overflowing its banks.” Governor Ortom confirmed the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people and prayed that the water subsides to enable the displaced persons return to their various homes.  Executive Secretary of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Dr. Emmanuel Shior, said more than seven local government areas had so far been affected. Shior said property worth billions of naira had also been destroyed by the flood. He added that as an interim measure, the state government had directed all affected persons to relocate to Makurdi Ultra-Modern International Market, a place designated for the victims. The SEMA boss said the state government was currently talking with NEMA, National High Commission for Refugees Migrants and IDPs as well as Christian Aid International and other partners to alleviate the plight of the people.
