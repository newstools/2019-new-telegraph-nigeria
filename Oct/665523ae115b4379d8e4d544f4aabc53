Three of the suspects, David Nwafor, Amechi Nwaogu and Nnamdi Nwafor are from Mbite/IhuobodoAwgu in Awgu Local Government Area, while the fourth suspect, Darlington Agu, is from Ihe village in the same local government. The latter was said to be the motorcyclist who took the other suspects to where they would buy the dead animals. The suspects, who reportedly operated in connivance with cold room operator, were nabbed at Agbogugu axis of Enugu by the operatives of Mbanabo Division. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Ebere Amaraizu, made this known to journalists. Amaraizu said the suspects, who were currently undergoing serious interrogation, were nabbed on Wednesday based on intelligence investigations. “The arrest of the suspects also led to the recovery of dead and decomposing meat which they usually sell to the unsuspecting members of the public. “The Commissioner of Police, Ahmad Abdurrahman, has directed a full-scale investigation in relation to the alleged nefarious activities of the suspects just as suspects are helping the operatives in their investigations.”
