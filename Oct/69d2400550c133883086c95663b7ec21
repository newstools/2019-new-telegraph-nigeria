Governor of Ebonyi state, Chief Dave Umahi yesterday postponed relocation of traders in Abakpa main market Abakaliki, the biggest market in the state to newly constructed International Market to 10th January, 2020. Umahi had given  the traders 18th October, 2019 deadline for relocation of the Abakpa Main market also known as Abakaliki main market  following  intervention of Christian Association of Nigeria which pleaded that the relocation date be extended to January next year. Umahi announced new date for relocation of the market in a meeting he had with the traders, building and Aluminum material dealers at Governor’s Lodge, Government House, Abakaliki. He said: “All the shops that were sealed before should be sealed back today before 2 o’clock, seal also the shops of those that took us to court in building material then day-by-day seal his shop and declare him wanted. “Anybody that wants to bring in politics into this thing, I am equal to the task. Some of you went to social media and write all kinds of rubbish that you wouldn’t have voted for me, this matter is at a time i don’t need your vote again, if you want to put it that way. I have no interest in that place, I was telling FERMA people because they said i can’t stop them work and i said I have right the least person in this state have right to stop them because their work is been badly done. “I am going to move the date of relocation of the market to 10th of January 2020 to honor CAN, but CAN i must get an agreement from all of them. Anybody that is a market person that does not sign this agreement individually must leave by 10th.”
