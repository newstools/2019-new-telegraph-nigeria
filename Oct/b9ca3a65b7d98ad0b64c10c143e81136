 Worried by the tragic loss of lives and the rate of distressed buildings in the area, the Lagos State Government said that it has marked over 100 buildings for demolition in Magodo.
The government also vowed to go after areas with similar topography in Lagos to ensure the safety of the structures, warning property owners with endangered structures to do the right thing or lose their houses.
A woman, two children and her sister were killed when a house built on a hill collapsed on another in the Otun Araromi area of Isheri – Magodo-Isheri.
New Telegraph learnt that the tragic development forced the state government to begin a thorough inspection of endangered buildings to avert recurrence of the tragedy.
Speaking on the planned demolition, the General Manager, Abiola Kosegbe, who led officials of the Lagos State Building Control Agency, LASBCAto the area to monitor illegal development in the area, said that the removal of the marked building was crucial to avert another collapse.
In the area, residents were seen paddling canoes to get to their destination as flood had taken over the road and hundreds of properties.
Kosegbe said: “We are just here to take an inventory of everything going on. We are 100 percent sure that the majority of properties here don’t have a development permit. We are going to take inventory of properties here and we have already served most of them, we will come back, and then they need to bring all their documents.
“Definitely, this is a flood-prone area and is susceptible to flooding, and before people can build here, there is supposed to be an engineering feat that needs to be done here. We will be back here, properties that don’t have a permit, then we will ensure they vacate their properties.”
She noted that notices had been given by the commissioner to residents of the area that they needed to vacate, as the area was not safe for habitation.
