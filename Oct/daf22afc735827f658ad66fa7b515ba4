The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN has  ordered lenders to ensure they have secured funding before bidding for short-term government securities, Bloomberg reported yesterday. According to the news agency, the directive, which took effect Monday, requires that all demand at auctions be “fully backed by appropriate funding,” the CBN said in circular to banks dated Oct. 18. Sanctions could include canceling bids, it said, adding that it “has observed a high level of unfunded demand.” Bloomberg quoted Kunle Ezun, a currency and fixed-income analyst at Ecobank Transnational Inc. in Lagos, as saying that: “Insisting on funding will help the central bank assess effective demand for its securities, rather than work on speculation.” Demand for Nigerian bonds may be dropping because of a slowdown in the global economy as well as weak sentiment toward emerging-market assets, according to Bank of America Corp. The West African nation depends on inflows into debt securities that yield more than 14per cent  to help support the naira.
