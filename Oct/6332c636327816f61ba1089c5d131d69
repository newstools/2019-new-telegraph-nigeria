The Department of State Services (DSS) has confirmed that scores of politicians from the two leading political parties of the All Progressive Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Bayelsa State have been placed under security watch and surveillance over possible involvement in the recruitment of youths and movement of heavy arms ahead of the November 17 governorship election in the state. The State Director of the DSS, Ishaku Yusuf, who made this known on Wednesday in Yenagoa during the election seminar organised by the Nigerian Police Force led by the Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG), Zone 5, D.P.Yakadi for political party chairmen and other stakeholders in the state, said those under security watch are politicians that have been identified as having the capacity of instigate violence during elections. “On the issue of identification of those intending to perpetuate violence during the election that is being done. Those who have the capacity have been put under security watch and homes under surveillance.” Yusuf, however, observed that the poor attitude and attendance of representatives of political parties to the security seminar showed the poor readiness of parties for the elections, adding that “another worry I have for the coming Bayelsa election, is the fact that we have 45 political parties listed for the election but 10 are in attendance here. It shows the security agencies are more ready than the owners of the election.” The Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Zone 5, Mr. D.P. Yakadi, in his lecture, identified various factors that could lead the coming elections into violence and advised critical stakeholders including the media, political parties and the INEC to step up preparations and work against corrupt tendencies before, during and after the elections.
