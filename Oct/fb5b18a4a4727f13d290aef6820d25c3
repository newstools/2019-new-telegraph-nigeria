Wife of Ondo State Governor, Mrs. Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu yesterday joined other First Ladies to officially unveil ‘First Ladies Against Cancer’ (FLAC), an initiative of First Ladies aimed at fighting the scourge of cancer at the official premiering of the movie “DIAMONDS IN THE SKY” at Point Harbour, Victoria Island, Lagos. Other First Ladies on the occasion included Dr. Ibironke Sanwoolu of Lagos State, Erelu Bisi Fayemi of Ekiti State, Evang. Omolewa Ahmed from Kwara, Dr. Mrs. Linda Ayade from Cross River State, Dr. Zainab Bagudu from Kebbi State, Mrs. Monica Ugwuanyi from Enugu State and former First Lady Ogun State, Dr. Mrs. Olufunsho Amosun. Akeredolu while leading other First Ladies to officially unveil the logo of FLAC said women most especially needed to understand how cancer progresses over time as all hands must be on deck to spread the gospel that ‘cancer no longer kills.’ According to her, women no longer needed to die needlessly from the disease as awareness about screening would make it possible for a woman to detect cancer early. While also urging women to go to the hospital when they detect any sign of cancer, Akeredolu stressed that faith and medicine would go hand-in-hand in the quest to get treatment.
