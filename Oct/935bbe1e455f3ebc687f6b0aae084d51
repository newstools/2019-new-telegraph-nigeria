F ederal Capital Territory Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, yesterday called on residents to make more commitment towards peaceful co-existence, saying that there can be no meaningful development without peace.  The minister, who made the call during a parade organised to mark Nigeria’s 59th independence anniversary, said the development of the FCT as the nation’s capital had been very rapid, but not without challenges.   Represented at the occasion by FCT Minister of State, Dr. Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, the minister noted that all hands must be on deck to fulfil the dreams of Nigeria’s and FCT founding fathers.  According to him, Nigeria survived the civil war and other turbulent times it had passed through, just because God wanted the country to remain as one indivisible entity.    He said: “The development of the FCT in itself has not been without its own challenges, many of which are associated with commitment of residents to the ideals of which the FCT was founded.   “It will gladden my heart as I have no doubt it will gladden the hearts of our founding fathers, because it will be the realisation of their dreams if every resident of the FCT truly regards the territory as home and treat her as such.  “For far too long, many residents of the FCT consider her as simply a location where they live out of necessity to make a living while their hearts lie somewhere else. I must say that for the FCT to really make the dreams of her founders become a reality and truly become a home for all Nigerians, we must treat her the way we treat the homes in which we live daily.   “I have often times said that as residents of the FCT, we owe ourselves and indeed the entire country to treat it as our one true home. It is a statement of fact that there now exists a generation of Nigerians who know no other home but the FCT. They were born in Abuja, schooled in Abuja, currently employed in Abuja and have started their own here in Abuja.”
