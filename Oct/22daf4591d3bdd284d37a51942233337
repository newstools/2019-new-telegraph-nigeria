Barcelona may revive their interest in Nigeria’s winger Samuel Chukwueze if they fail in their pursuit for Neymar next summer.   The Blaugrana spent the whole last summer transfer window chasing Neymar who departed Camp Nou two years ago but PSG refused to sanction a move for the Brazilian.   Reports have suggested that Barcelona will not give up on the chase of Neymar especially with Ousmane Dembelé struggling with injuries since his move to the Camp Nou from Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2017.   However, according to a respected Spanish football website Gol Digital, the chiefs at Barca are ready to go for alternatives should Neymar deal fail to scale through next summer.   The former Golden Eaglets star has been an outstanding performer since he broke into Villarreal senior team last season and has now scored 10 goals in 45 appearances for the Yellow Submarines. Although Villarreal have inserted a release clause of 63 million euros into the Nigerian’s latest contract, he is seen as a cheaper alternative to Neymar.   Meanwhile, reports also suggested that Barca rivals Atletico are also still interested the dazzling Nigerian winger and may also make a move for his next July.   Chukwueze has also been linked with English Premier League giants including Liverpool, Arsenal  and Leicester City.
