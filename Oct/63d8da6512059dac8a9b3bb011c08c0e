The Nigeria Football Federation Reforms Committee on Tuesday evening ended a two-day meeting in Abuja with focus on how to best re-position Nigerian Football through tinkering with governance structure, women’s football and youth/grassroots development and the various leagues.  While thanking all the members, the Chairman of the committee, Seyi Akinwunmi, who is also NFF’s 1st Vice President, revealed that the committee’s final recommendations would be implemented by the NFF. Some of the decision agreed on was to provide the most stable and sustainable foundations for football in Nigeria.  To ensure a commitment to the principles of good governance, inclusion and transparency in all areas of its operations which also requires its member associations, officials and employees to meet the high standards set in this regard.   Also, to adapt to the latest development in the world of football so as to ensure that its operations and values adhere to the best governance standards possible.   To progressively adopt a wide range of reforms that reflect the views of the Nigerian and International Football Community in order to meet the evolving needs of the modern game.   And finally to ensure that the principles enunciated by the Committee and its recommendations which are accepted by the Executive Committee are incorporated into an amended version of the NFF Statutes and pave the way for further significant and much-needed changes to NFF’s governance structure, electoral procedures and dispute resolution mechanism.
