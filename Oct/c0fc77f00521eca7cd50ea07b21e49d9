 T he Senate yesterday mandated the management of the University of Maiduguri (UNIMAID) to put on hold the recent increment of tuition fees for students of the institution. The Senate also directed its Committee on Tertiary Education and TETFUND to investigate the matter with a view to finding a lasting solution to the issue.  The apex legislative chamber made the resolution following a motion considered during plenary sponsored by Senator Abubakar Kyari (APC, Borno North). While leading debate on the motion, Kyari bemoaned the recent decision by UNIMAID management to increase the registration and other fees of the school from N25,000 to N129,000, an increase of over 400 per cent.  “Half of the men in North-East Nigeria have received no education at all, and this figure rises to over sixty-one per cent for women. It is imperative that schools in the North-East should remain of strategic national interest with overwhelming national security importance,” he said.   He pointed out that education remained a repellent and potent tool to defeat Boko Haram and also revamp the North-East from under-development and poverty. The senator further noted that sixty-two per cent of Nigerian children who were not in school live in northern Nigeria.   He said: “Borno State has the highest number of people that don’t have access to education due to Boko Haram crisis in particular.” Accordingly, he called on stakeholders to rise and ensure that the fee increment was reversed due to the greater need to propagate empowerment through education at tertiary levels. Making its resolutions, Senate mandated its Committee on Tertiary Education and TETFUND to also engage the Ministry of Education and other stakeholders such as the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), with a view to reaching consensus on a harmonised fee for all universities across the country.
