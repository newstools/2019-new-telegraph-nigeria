Lagos State Government has alerted residents on the rise of the sea water level, saying that the development has contributed to current to flooding in many parts of Ikoyi, V.I, Dolphin Estate and Oworoshoki. The government explained that the inability of the lagoon to discharge water into the ocean is what is causing backflow into the drainage channels. In a statement by the Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Tunji Bello, the officials of the state are also working on different measuresÂ to remove the constriction and blockades that would allow easy passage for the resultant flooding. The state government is also in talks with the officials of the Ogun-Osun River Basin Authority which is releasing water to do so gradually. He said the officials of the Drainage Department had expected the backflow to go down by evening but from the look of things now may last throughout the weekend. Similarly, the commissioner said the Ogun-Osun River Basin Authority can no longer hold the Oyan Dam hence has been releasing its water causing a rise in the Ogun River and this has affected low lying areas like Isheri North and Magodo and up to Owode Onirin. Bello said until the ocean level goes down, the lagoon cannot discharge water into the ocean and causing back flow into all the drainage outlets in the state.
