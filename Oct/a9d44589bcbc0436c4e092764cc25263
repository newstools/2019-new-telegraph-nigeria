Yenago With less than 35 days to the Bayelsa State governorship election, the governor of the state Henry Seriake Dickson has said that the ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was a ticket of “militancy, terrorism, criminality and cultism”. Speaking on Tuesday in Yenagao during the formal launch and inauguration of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) campaign team, Governor Dickson said that if given the opportunity to govern, their government was going to be the government of militancy and cultism. Disclosing that he was therefore launching “operation wind up APC in Bayelsa State”, the governor said: “Democracy in Bayelsa State cannot be defined as a government of militants and cultists for militants and cultists by militants and cultists.” He, however, told Bayelsans to take the election seriously maintaining that “If you don’t take this election seriously, on the 17th of November a lot of people will be packing to run away from the state.” Continuing he said: “This election is not about myself or about the PDP candidate, Senator Douye Diri, but about the future of the state which is at stake. Therefore you should preserve the glorious future which is being threatened by the inordinate ambitions of some politicians who don’t mean well for our state.” The Governor noted that he was not perturbed by the gale of defections hitting PDP, stating that what was happening now was insignificant and inconsequential compared to the gale of defections in 2015 when the PDP still emerged victorious.
Speaking earlier, the PDP candidate, Senator Douye Diri had urged Bayelsans to desist from voting people whom he said have been tested but failed woefully. As a former National Organising Secretary of the Ijaw National Congress, he said he was at the forefront of fighting against the environmental degradation caused by the operations of International Oil Companies.
