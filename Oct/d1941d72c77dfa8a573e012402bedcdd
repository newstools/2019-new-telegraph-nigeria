Sola Adeyemo, Ibadan The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has indicated its readiness for another showdown with the Federal Government over planned imposition of Integrated Personnel Payroll System (IPPIS) on its members. Following President Muhammadu Buhariâ€™s directive that any worker not on the IPPIS would no longer receive salary, the leaders of the Union summoned an emergency National Executive Council meeting where it was agreed that the leadership at University levels should begin mobilisation of members for an action against the Federal Government. The Chairman, University of Ibadan Chapter, Professor Deji Omole, Sunday said that the Union was not against accountability, but will resist attempt by the government to violate existing laws and autonomy of the University. According to Omole, ASUU has offered to help the Federal Government design the appropriate template that will factor in the peculiarities of university lecturers in the IPPIS, but the government seems bent on using the world-bank designed exploitative template. The ASUU boss said the template designed by government plans to enslave intellectuals as it does not make provisions for payment of arrears of promotion, study leave allowance, responsibility allowance among others.
