 T he Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has advised commercial banks in the country to be circumspect in giving loans or any form of credit to Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State.   This, the party said, was because the state is not willing to bear any responsibility for such facilities if the governor fails to win re-election.   PDP in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said Governor Bello will not win the November 16 governorship election, adding that there is consensus by the people Kogi State to vote its candidate, Engr. Musa Wada, as the next governor.   The PDP accused the Kogi State government of misleading commercial banks into granting it huge loans under certain hazy items and conditions, after which the money would be allegedly frittered by leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and cronies of the administration.   The statement read in part: “Our party wants the nation to note that the people of Kogi State can no longer accept any further mortgaging of the future of the state by Yahaya Bello, whose administration has gone down as the most profligate in the history of our nation and which cannot account for over N700 billion of Kogi funds released to him in the last four years.   “Anybody or organisation in league with Yahaya Bello is directly supporting the torturing and impoverishing of the people of Kogi State by the Bello administration, which has manifested so much insensitivity in owing workers as much as 36 months’ salary arrears.”   Warning that the people of Kogi State are not ready to inherit any financial liabilities, PDP assured of its commitment to running “a prudent, transparent and productive administration where the welfare and economic empowerment of the people is overriding; where salaries are paid promptly, where infrastructure development in critical sectors take center stage and where accountability is the watchword.”   The party added: “In this regard, the PDP urges all financial watch organisations to join the people of Kogi State in monitoring all monetary activities of the Bello administration as well as all inflows into the state coffers, particularly, the N10.06 billion federal refund, which the PDP insists, must be declared and directly channeled for the payment of salaries so as not to allow the ring of APC leaders achieve their plot of diverting and stealing the money for their selfish purposes.”
