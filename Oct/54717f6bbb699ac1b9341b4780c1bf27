The people of Kolokuma/Opokuma Local Government Council in Bayelsa State have declared support for the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief David Lyon, ahead of the November 16 governorship election in the state. They said their son, Senator Douye Diri, who is the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was elected without any form of consultation with them. Speaking on behalf of the people of the area in Sabageria during APC’s governorship campaign rally, Alternate Director General of the APC Bayelsa State 2019 Governorship Campaign Council, Prof. Seiyefa Brisibe, said the PDP deceived the people of Kolokuma/Opokuma during its last primary election that produced Senator Diri. He pointed out that the area had an illustrious son they wanted as governorship candidate, but Governor Seriake Dickson gave the PDP ticket to Diri without consulting with people of the area. He further said that the PDP candidate does not represent the interest of the people of the area and therefore cannot attract any form of development to the people, just as they did not benefit from the Dickson’s government for close to eight years. “They claim we should support them because they have given us a governorship candidate. But did they consult us before giving us the governorship candidate? I urge you to vote for APC because we are sure of empowerment and development when David Lyon is in power,” he declared. The APC governorship candidate, Lyon, on his part, assured the people of the area that if voted into office come November 16, he will complete the Sabageria/Polako bridge project. He also promised to provide soft loans and grants for small and medium scale businesses women from the area, in a bid to move the people above the poverty line. “I am an Ijaw man like you, and I know your problems because they are the same problems I face everyday as a person. When I become governor, I assure you that I would work hard to solve your problems,” he said.
