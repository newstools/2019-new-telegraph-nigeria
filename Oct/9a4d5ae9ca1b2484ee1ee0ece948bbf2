President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday vowed to push headlong the war against drug abuse. The President said the fight remains one of the critical elements of the ‘Next Level’ mandate of this administration. Buhari, who stated this while receiving the report of the Presidential Advisory Committee on the Elimination of Drug Abuse (PACEDA) at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, reiterated the commitment of government to the welfare of the citizenry by fighting the scourge of drug abuse. He said: “Winning the war becomes one of the critical elements of the ‘Next Level’ mandate of this administration. As a government, we have the responsibility to ensure the security and wellbeing of our people. “Our findings have shown that it is more difficult to bring down crime rate to acceptable levels without clearing our country of substances abuse.” President Buhari, however, realising the enormity of the menace, solicited for cooperation of all and sundry. He called on all well-meaning Nigerians and international partners to join hands with relevant government agencies in the fight against drug abuse. While thanking the committee for its timely and diligent prosecution of the assignment, the President assured that the matter was of utmost importance, and the report would be studied along with the recommendations. Earlier, the Chairman of the committee, Brigadier General Buba Marwa (rtd), had told the President that since the committee was inaugurated in December, 2018, it interfaced with a wide spectrum of stakeholders including Ministries, Departments and Agencies, Non-Governmental organisations, Civil Society Organisations, Faith-based Organisations, professional bodies, international partners and members of drug user communities with their parents, teachers and care givers.
