Super Eagles captain Ahmed Musa, Oghenekharo Etebo and Ola Aina will return for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against the Squirrels of Benin in November. Musa, Etebo, and Aina missed out from Nigeria’s 1-1 draw against the five-time World Cup champions, the Samba Boys of Brazil, in an international friendly game at the weekend, due to various injuries. The team coach Gernot Rohr who seems to be worried about the injuries to some of his key players, told Brila Fm that he hoped they would be fit for the big task ahead of the team. “Now what will happen with all these injured players back? “If Musa can come back, if Aina can come back and if Etebo too can come back, so we will see what can happen with the top players for these impactful games,” Rohr added. The three-time AFCON champions will host Benin on November 11 before facing Lesotho on November 19.
