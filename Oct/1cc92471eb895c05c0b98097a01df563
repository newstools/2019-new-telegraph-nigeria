Both top Nigerian officials spoke to the players and officials of the Super Eagles on telephone when President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Mr. Amaju Melvin Pinnick visited the team camp on Saturday evening.   Pinnick was part of the team’s official training at the Singapore National Stadium and then joined the group for dinner, where he made calls to the Lagos State number one citizen and the Youth and Sports Minister.   “I want to commend you all, that is the technical crew, backroom staff and players for the good job you are doing. The whole of Nigeria is behind you. We’ll be watching the game live here, fully supporting you as you go for a win against the Brazilians,” said Youth and Sports Minister.   Lagos State governor was also on the telephone urging the team to do Nigeria proud by going all out against the five-time world champions.  In their responses, Technical Adviser Gernot Rohr and stand-in captain William Ekong promised that the team will put up a good outing that will do the country proud.
