Motorists have expressed concern over the renewed efforts of the Federal Government to re-introduce tollgate on roads across the country, describing it as an anti-people policy. Some members of National Union of Roads Transport Workers (NURTW) who rejected the moves in totality, said the present administration has no better plans for the development of Nigeria, than to unleash hardship on already impoverished masses. A union leader at the popular Utako park in Abuja, Alhaji Abdulrazak Olawole, said the planned policy has revealed more reasons why Nigerians don’t trust their leaders. Olawole, who was embittered that he voted and also mobilised people to vote for the All Progressives Congress (APC), noted that he has not stopped regretting his actions which he acknowledged helped to enshrine “deception” in Nigeria. “Allah, I regret ever voting and also mobilizing people to vote for APC. How can they promise Nigerians better life, but are now bringing hardship. This type of change they are bringing to us is deception and wickedness. “The same people who opposed the return of tollgate on our roads in the past are now the same people who want to return it.” Another respondent, Zakari Musa who said he is a driver, noted that the reintroduction of tollgate on Nigerian roads means that transporters would hike fares, which will occasion more hardship. Musa wondered why the same government that promised the people a better life, would resort to policies that will drain the poor masses of their meagre resources. “Once the tollgate returns, we will have to increase transportation fares. From Abuja which we collect between N1,800 to N2,000, depending on the type of car you enter, will definitely increase to N2,500. “Another problem is that government cannot even be trusted to manage the tollgate well. We may also experience corruption there, because the government will end up using it to create jobs for their, it,” he noted.
