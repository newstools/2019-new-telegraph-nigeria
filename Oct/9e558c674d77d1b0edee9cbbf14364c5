 L agos State governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu has urged the people of Lagos State to take advantage of the Lagos Home Ownership Scheme that government and private partnership is providing to own a house in Lagos State.  Speaking during the Victoria Crest Homes Property Festival in Lekki, Lagos, Governor Sanwo-Olu, who was represented at the event by his Special Adviser on Housing, Mrs Toke Benson-Awoyinka, encouraged people to log in into the housing policy of government.  She also commended the good gesture of Dr. Kennedy Okonkwo, the CEO of Nedcomoaks, owners of Victoria Crest Homes for providing a platform for 1,000 people to be a landlord in Lekki with a deposit of a one million naira.  Her words: “I am glad that the private sector is helping government in term of housing policy. Dr. Okonkwo has done a lot in providing thousands of affordable homes for people in Lagos and I believe if 100 more private sector builders do the same, we would be where we need to be. I am glad that whatever government is preaching, the private sector is also tagging along to make sure it is achieve.  “Lagos State government has its own housing policy. We have Lagos Home Ownership Mortgage Scheme (HOMS). We are also joining private sector people to provide affordable housing for people. We have Lagos HOMS in different parts of state and we are also doing what we can to make sure that housing become affordable to everybody in Lagos.  “I will advise Lagosians to take advantage of the homes that government and private partnership is bringing up. For example, you don’t need to have N45million to own a home in Victoria Crest Homes. With one million naira, you can be a homeowner.”
