The year 2019 is turning out to be a year of awards for the multi-talented actress, producer and model, Yetunde Barnabas. The actress who shot into limelight when she was crowned the Most Beautiful Girl in Abuja and recently Miss Tourism Nigeria, has been nominated at the 2019 Scream Awards for Model of the Year. Ms Barnabas is also nominated for Beauty Queen of the Year at the Africa Choice Awards, billed to hold on the 8th of December 2019. These awards come on the heels of her nomination for the Most Promising Actress of the Year award at the Nigerian Achievers Awards 5.0 for her stellar performances as Ms Pepeiye in the popular hit television sitcom, Papa Ajasco, as well as other feature length films including Erin Folami, Dagogo 1 and 2, Kosepin, Tombolo, and Elegbenla (alongside Niyi Johnson and Akin Olaiya). The actress has enjoyed a meteoric rise in Nollywood, since her debut, featuring in over 50 feature films and several television series, with her portrayal of Ms Pepeiye coming up for rave reviews from critics and viewers. A DSTV ambassadorship role followed her 2017 win at the Most Beautiful Girl in Abuja pageant and since then she has modeled for several notable Nigerian fashion brands. In 2019 she won the Miss Tourism Nigeria pageant and has so carried herself very well as the reigning beauty queen. The actress, who is also a film producer, has so far produced four movies, the latest of which, Omo Iya Osun, was released in late 2018 and had movie goers in a frenzy. She is working on several others and is definitely not slowing down any time soon.
