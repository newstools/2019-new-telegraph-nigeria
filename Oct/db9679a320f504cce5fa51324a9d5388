Policemen attached to Operation Zenda in Benue State yesterday recovered decomposing body of Sergeant Abraham Ihom’s wife, Mrs. Bridget Ihom. Bridget was gruesomely murdered alongside her husband, a policeman serving in Katsina-Ala Division. Officer in charge of the operation, SP Justin Gberindyer, told journalists that Abraham and wife were killed and buried by gunmen in Zaki-Biam in Ukum Local Government Area of the state when he visited home. Sources said it took the men of Operation Zenda relentless efforts to arrest some of the killers to get to the site where Abraham’s wife was buried. However, the men were yet to recover the body of the sergeant at press time. Abraham’s family members were said to have expressed appreciation to Gberindyer, his team, Police Force and Governor Samuel Ortom for intensifying the war against criminality in the state. The same men of Operation Zenda recently uncovered a mass grave in Ushongo Local Government Area and arrested some suspected criminals.
