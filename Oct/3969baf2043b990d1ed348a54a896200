The injury that Nigeria’s first choice goalkeeper, Francis Uzoho, had in Sunday’s friendly match with Brazil has ruled him out for six months.
The Nigerian goalkeeper in an attempt to save a cross in the 60th minute landed awkwardly and thus got his ligament torn.
He was subsequently replaced by Germany-based Fortuna Düsseldorf goakeeper, Maduka Okoye who thus made his debut for Nigeria.
Of late, since the international retirement of Vincent Enyeama and the illness of his replacement, Carl Ikeme who also had to retire, Super Eagles have had to contend with goalkeeping headaches.
Ikechukwu who stepped in in a World Cup qualifying match with Cameroon two years ago turned to be a mere flash.
Daniel Akpeyi has not also fared better as a substitute to either Enyeama or Ikeme.
Theophilus Afelokhai who sidelined Ezenwa in Enyimba and subsequently forced his exit from the club has also not proven a major contender for Nigeria’s number one spot.
The four times he had to pick the ball from his net in the African Nations’ championship duel with Togo last month put serious doubts on his credentials in the national team.
