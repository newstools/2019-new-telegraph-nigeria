A t least, seven people have died after some cultists and Okunde community in Boki Local Government Area of Cross River State engaged in a supremacy war.  It was learnt that owing to the activities of cultists in Okunde, the entire Osokom community under Okunde held a meeting to check their activities.  However, the plan leaked to the cultists and they infiltrated the community. They killed a man, Joseph Bukie Bankong.  The cultists allegedly camped in the Apostolic Church in Okunde, close to Boki Boys’ Secondary School, before striking on Monday night.  Bankong was said to have been opposed to the activities of cult groups before he was hacked to death on Monday night, as he spoke vehemently against their activities.   On Tuesday, the community rose up in search of the cultists and ended up killing six people. They include Alphonsus Etta Ewung, Otu Agbor Edum (Chief Paulinus Otu’s son).   In the resulting fight, several houses and property worth millions of naira were destroyed between Monday and Tuesday.   In a telephone interview, the state Police Commissioner, Austin Agbonlahor, confirmed the cult war.   However, he said the police have been mobilized to the area to maintain peace.
