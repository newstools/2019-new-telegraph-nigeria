 Onyekachi Eze, ABUJA  An Abuja Federal High Court has ordered a substituted service on the governorship candidate  of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in November 16 election in Bayelsa State, Chief David Lyon and his running mate Senator Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo. Lyon and Degi-Eremienyo have been evading court service, forcing the petitioner, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to apply to the court for a substituted service. The request was granted at the sitting of the court on October 2, which also ordered that all other processes be given substituted services. The PDP had accused the APC running mate, Senator Degi of providing false information in the form he submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the election. In the court summon, the party alleged that while the primary school certificate of the senator bears Degi Biobara, his secondary school is bearing Adegi Biobarakumo while his university certificate bears Degi Biobarakuma and MBA certificate, Degi Biobarakuma Wangaha. The party is therefore asking the court to determine the identity of the person(s) in these school results. PDP is also accusing the APC gubernatorial running mate of declaring a false affidavit in the regularization of names for the Senate, arguing that an affidavit does not suffice to correct errors in names as this would need an advert on the newspapers where the names would be published and errors highlighted for notice of the general public.
