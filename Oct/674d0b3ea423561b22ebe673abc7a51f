…As blogger goes into hiding Following the trending audio recording in which an aide to Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State allegedly threatened to deal with a blogger if he did not desist from writing about the state government, a group, South-East Equity Alliance (SEA) has written to Ikpeazu urging him to defend his oath of office.
The group also demanded that the governor immediately sacks his Senior Special Assistant on General Duties, Mr. Uchenna Erondu whose voice is said to have been captured in the audio recording intimidating a student blogger, Ogochukwu Nwaokeoma and threatening to whisk him to Abuja if he dares write anything else about the activities of the Abia State government.
However, there are unconfirmed indications that the blogger, Nwaokeoma, has since fled the state and gone into hiding for fear of his life.
In an open letter to the Abia State governor signed by the National Coordinator of the group, Comrade Ekeh Ifeanyi Chimezie (Imo State); National Secretary, Okoro Williams (Ebonyi State) and the National Public Relations Officer, Debby Tochi Joy (Abia State), the group urged Ikpeazu to rise up in defence of democracy, constitutional governance and his oath to protect lives and properties of Abia citizens.
