The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described the victory of Sokoto State Governor, Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal at the tribunal as an endorsement of his leadership style.
The party said in a statement Wednesday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan that the judgement was a confirmation of the triumph of the will of the people, as expressed in the March 23 governorship election.
According to the PDP, Governor Tambuwal’s victory at the tribunal was evinced in his commitment towards the development of the state and the empowerment of the people.
“Indeed, Governor Tambuwal’s achievements in developing the state and empowering the people in all critical sectors of life stood him out in his first term. His re-election therefore marks the determination of the people to consolidate on good governance in their state,” the statement added.
The party, however, rejected the judgements of the governorship election tribunal that upheld the election of Abdullahi Ganduje and Simon Lalong of Kano and Plateau states respectively.
It nevertheless urged its members and supporters not to lose hope as the tribunal is not the end of the road adding that justice will surely prevail at the end of the day.
