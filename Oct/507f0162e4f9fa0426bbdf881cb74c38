K ada Queens of Kaduna edged northern rivals Desert Queens 22-18 in the first game played at the Prudent Energy Handball League yesterday at the Mobolaji Johnson Sports Complex, Rowe Park, Yaba. Both teams gave their best in a game that saw lots of exciting moments but it was the Queens from Kaduna that did more to win the game. Former Nigerian Women champions, Imo Grasshoppers fell to Ghana Police team 25-36. The results will not affect the position of Grasshoppers on the league table, but was a good test for the Imo team, who currently remains fourth on the log. The Ghanaian team is playing as an invited team and their result will not have any bearing on tournament. Plateau Vipers came out smoking in the tie and were three goals better than Borno Spiders as the game ended 29-26. Spiders played their part in the interesting tie but were unable to score the goals that would give them victory. Their aggressive towards the end of the game was also not enough to help them win the games as they would hope for better luck today. Edo Dynamos continued their good run in the league by beating Owena Queens 29-19 to remain unbeaten in the second phase of the league. This would go down as one of the easiest game for Dynamos who played with a lot of reserves in their tank with the clash against table-topping Safety Babes, a must-win for the Edo team. D. Defenders (Civil Defence) were in ruthless form as they defeated Prison Key Boys 44-22 in a one sided affair yesterday. The Civil Defence dominated the game and it was a matter of how big the scoreline would be as their victory was never in doubt. COAS Shooters were also at their best as they defeated Sokoto Rima 35-32 to end the morning games yesterday.
