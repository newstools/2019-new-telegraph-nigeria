A n extremely hot porridge, being transported in a tricycle in Bauchi State has claimed the lives of three children, aged between nine months and nine years.   The porridge, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), was being transported in a jumbo-size plastic flask when the tricycle plunged into a pothole and upturned, emptying the porridge on the occupants of the tricycle.   Narrating the incident yesterday, a relation of the victims, Malam Auwal Bala, said the tragedy occurred on Wednesday while the family was celebrating the marriage of a member.   He said: “Three women and six children were inside the tricycle conveying the porridge, known as ‘gwate’ in local parlance, to the venue of the celebration. The flask containing the porridge was placed inside the tricycle at the rear and when the tricycle plunged into a large pothole, it summersaulted and the extremely hot content of the flask poured on the children on their heads, shoulders and chests. Three of the children, Aniya Yahaya (6), Mariam Mohammed (9) and Ibrahim Yusuf, nine months, died from serious burns, while a fourth child, Khadijah Usman, aged seven, is currently in critical condition.” Bala added that one of the women also sustained injuries, while the remaining two children and two women escaped unhurt. He said that losing three members of the family, mostly children, was most traumatic, but said that they had since gone ‘philosophical’ about the incident.   He said: “God giveth, God taketh. Who are we to question the will of God.”
