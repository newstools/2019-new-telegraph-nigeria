A push by the Ondo State Governor, Mr. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu SAN, to seek another term in office has received a boost as one of the key leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, Dr. Pius Osunyikanmi, has declared his support for the governor’s second term ambition. Osunyikanmi, who is the Director-General of Directorate of Technical Aids Corps, also gave a marching order to his supporters to mobilise for the party and Akeredolu’s reelection bid. The APC chieftain stated this yesterday while hosting his friend, General Obadiah Ethal (Rtd), at his country home, Ile-Oluji, headquarters of Ile-Oluji/ Oke-Igbo local government. Osunyinkanmi also used the event to clear the air on reports making the rounds in the state that he was nursing an ambition to contest the party’s governorship ticket with Akeredolu. He said: “I will not say much but it is necessary for me to clear the air on some reports. I am not contesting for governorship post and even if I want to contest, Akeredolu must complete his eight years. “So my dear party members, let us continue to promote the political ideology of our great party to the good people of Ondo State and give our maximum support to Arakunrin Akeredolu’s administration. “General, if not because of the weather, I would have driven you to Ore to see the ongoing construction of flyover interchange. This is one of the landmark projects being executed by the Arakunrin Akeredolu’s administration. “We still have confidence in his administration because he has not disappointed us. Our prayer for the governor is that God should give him good health to complete his eight years so that he can revolutionise the entire state. “General, we expect more of your visit to Ondo State. I will be inviting you when the governor will be flagging off his second term campaign and also invite you when he will be sworn-in for second term.”
