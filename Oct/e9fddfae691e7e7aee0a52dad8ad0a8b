A legal consultant and Senior Partner, Olaniwun Ajayi , Mr Muyiwa Balogun, has called on Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) and its Asset Management Partners (AMPs) as well as the Inter-Agency Presidential Committee set up by the Federal Government to leverage the 2019 Amended AMCON Act, which has been signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari and recover the over N5trillion outstanding AMCON debt before sunset. Balogun, who made a case in support of the 2019 amendments while addressing external solicitors and AMPs of AMCON in Abuja, further painted a gloomy picture of what could further befall the already challenged Nigerian economy if the debts are not recovered in good time before the sunset period.   According to him, AMCON debt could easily rise to a whopping N6.6trillion by 2024 because AMCON still owes the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) N4.5trillion and also battling with N1.7trillion of Assets Under Litigation (AUL). Given the fact that the debt will eventually become the burden of the Federal Government and by extension taxpayers, he argued that there was need for speed in recovery just as all hands should be on deck to ensure that AMCON recovers the debt as mandated by the new amendments. He said it was immoral to allow the obligors go without punishment especially since both the Holy Bible and the Quran, which incidentally are the dominant religions in the country, abhor people who borrow without the intention to pay back. The process needed the additional powers, according to Balogun because AMCON operating at 100 per cent efficiency to realise the available collaterals would still face a 68 per cent gap to plug the unrecovered exposure meaning that to plug the gap, AMCON should do whatever it takes including aggressively pursuing both primary and secondary obligors.   From his argument, it is only debtors that would have issues with the new amendments because those who mean well for the Nigerian economy will rather see the act as one that has come to enhance AMCON debt recovery capability and improve supporting regime for enforcement.
