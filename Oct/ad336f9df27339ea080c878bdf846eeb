Nobel Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, will be a special guest to review Chief Keith Richards’ latest book, “Never Quite the Insider: a Nigerian Memoir”, in Lagos on October 17.  The event, set to draw the business, media and literary/ arts community, will be held at Terra Kulture, Victoria Island, Lagos. The book, described by the author as demonstration of “his love affairs with Nigeria”, is partly a memoir, a travelogue and documentation of his management practice in corporate Nigeria. It touches on difficult and sensitive issues including corruption, ethnicity, multinationals’ complacency, and whether white men should wear traditional dress.   “Twenty years of running multiple businesses in Nigeria qualifies me to write an instructive memoir…., I believe I have insights that have values. I should be able to throw in some humour and willingness to tackle controversial subjects of an unusual account of this misunderstood society and my love affair with it,” the author said.  From 2005 to 2007, Richard wrote a weekly column for the Nigerian BusinessDay newspaper called “Outsider Inside”. The column was a mixture of business, social comment, humour and inevitably, politics. His career has spanned over thirty years of involvement in developing markets, especially Africa.  A former Managing Director of Promasidor Nigeria Limited, he had also been Managing Director of Guinness Nigeria Plc and of International Equitable Association, IEA. In recognition of his work with communities, he bagged several chieftaincy titles and is a fellow of Lagos State Polytechnic
