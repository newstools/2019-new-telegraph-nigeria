The two parties reached the agreement at the Headquarters of Ethiopian Airlines after a high-powered meeting attended by the airline’s top executives, led by Group Chief Executive Officer of Ethiopian Airlines, Dr. Tewolde Gebremariam, and a delegation from Rivers State led by Governor Nyesom Wike. The Chief Commercial Officer, Esayas Wolde Mariam, who was also present, declared that Ethiopian Airlines has agreed to fly permanently from Port Harcourt International Airport subject to the approval of the federal authorities. He said: “We are willing and capable to fly into Port Harcourt on a regular basis. For now, we have exhausted our Bilateral Air Agreement approval and we need another approval to operate the Port Harcourt route. “We need your help to ensure that approval comes from the federal authorities. At first, there should be a temporary operating permit, pending the final approval.” Mariam added that Ethiopian Airlines needs the initial support of the Rivers State Government for handling and aviation infrastructure in Port Harcourt to develop the new market. He declared that Ethiopian Airlines will also embark on advertisements to promote Port Harcourt as a tourist and investment destination. On his part, Wike declared that his government would provide an enabling environment for Ethiopian Airlines to operate in the state, promising to make Port Harcourt a regional air transport hub for greater economic development of the state. The governor assured that he will meet with the Minister of Aviation to ensure that Port Harcourt International Airport is approved for Ethiopian Airlines as a destination. He said: “As we, therefore, consolidate on our achievements, we want to also focus on making Port Harcourt city a regional air transport hub through the private public partnership approach while leveraging on the existing aviation infrastructure and related market and other advantages of the state. “I wish to assure you that we are ready to do everything within our powers and spheres of authority and influence to facilitate the realisation of your interest and desire directly and sustainably fly from Port Harcourt to Addis Ababa and other parts of the world.” Wike, who also thanked Ethiopian Airlines for their interest in expanding and retaining their services in Port Harcourt, promised that his government will offer its social partnership, goodwill and support. The governor noted that Port Harcourt was strategically located to serve as a transit point for the entire South-South and parts of the South-East. “We have agreed in principle that there is need for Ethiopian Airlines to fly from Port Harcourt to other destinations. Port Harcourt is a destination of choice, as it easily accessible for the entire South-South and other states in the South-East,” Wike said.
