The All Progressives Congress (APC) Tuesrday said that President Muhammadu Buhari was in hurry to create jobs for the teeming unemployed youths and grow the economy of Nigeria.   The APC National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole made this known when the delegation from the Vietnamese Government paid a visit to members of the National Working Committee (NWC) in Abuja.   The delegation was led by His Excellency, Nguyen Hai Ninh, the Deputy Chief of Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, according to statement from Chief Press Secretary to the APC National Chairman, Simon Ebegbulem.   Quoting his principal, Ebeegbulem said: “To achieve this, the APC-led Federal Government is reviving our textile industry so that we work towards taking advantage of our comparative advantage in this sector so it can help provide jobs to the over two hundred million of our population.”  According to Ebeegbulem in the statement, Oshiomhole disclosed that President Buhari was in a hurry to provide jobs to unemployed Nigerians as well as accelerate the growth of the economy, stating, “it is as a result of this that the APC-led administration is fighting corruption vigorously so our common wealth will not be concentrated in the hands of a few but that of the majority.”     According to him: “With a population of 200million we have the advantage of a huge market but we also have a huge challenge of ensuring an economic growth that will make that 200 million people comfortable. Before the coming of President Buhari, we have missed a lot of opportunities.   “We had challenges in power supply and of course we have our own share of security challenges. And of course the President had to fight corruption so that few people cannot take the wealth of this nation. Nigerians voted overwhelmingly for our President, so we are going to take advantage of this second term to ensure that we accelerate economic growth so that we will meet the needs of our people.”
