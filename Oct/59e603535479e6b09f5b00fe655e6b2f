Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr’s headache for the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho next month may have increased following the injury copped by Lille’s and Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen in last Saturday’s league tie against Bordeaux. Rohr must be in search for a good replacement for the forward that put up a good display against Ukraine and Brazil in Nigeria’s last international friendlies. Lille coach Christopher Galtier confirmed that Osimhen was injured and it could be a big problem for the Club. After picking an injury in Lille’s 3-0 home win against Girondins Bordeaux on Saturday, Osimhen was replaced early in the second half by former French striker Loic Remy. Lille manager Galtier told the press conference after the win that his number one striker was down with an injury that could be serious. “Osimhen has a pain in the adductor, it can be a big problem,” Galtier said. Osimhen is now doubtful for Nigeria’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying double-header against Benin and Lesotho billed for November 14 and 19 respectively. Osimhen has scored seven times and recording two assists in 11 league outings for Les Dogues so far this season.
