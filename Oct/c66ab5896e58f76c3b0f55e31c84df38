  Barely 24 hours after securing the conviction of one Adepoju Tomiwa, an Internet fraudster, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ilorin Zonal Office on Wednesday secured another conviction of one Akinbamidele Femi John charged before a Kwara State High Court on a three-count charge bordering on Internet Fraud and other Fraud Related Offences. While delivering judgment on the matter, Justice Mahmood Abdulgafar said the Court after evaluating the case found the defendant guilty of all the three count charges levelled against him by the anti-graft body and consequently sentenced him to six months imprisonment without an option of fine. Count one of the charge stated: “That you, Akinbamidele Femi John (a.k.a BrendaJason) on or about 20th March, 2018 at Ilorin, Kwara State within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court attempted to commit an offence by pretending to be Brenda Jason,  a female with a gmail account;jasonbrenda00@gmail.com and thereby committed an offence contrary to sections 95 and 321 of the penal code law and punishable under section 324 of the same law.” Akinbamidele had during his arraignment on Monday pleaded guilty to all the three count charges levelled against him by the EFCC.
