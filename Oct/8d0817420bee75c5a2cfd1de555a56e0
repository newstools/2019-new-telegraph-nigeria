H ow often do you bat your eyelashes? Do you just stare or you flaunt it once in a while?  Whether long or short, full or scanty, you don’t need disguising your eyes under red cherry before you can look bold and defiant; all you need is to apply simple approach.  You can look your best wearing blue mascara that makes your eyes blend to coyness!  Blue mascara makes your eyes pop and adds beauty to its contour.   It gives your eyelashes a sexy look, and gives your eyeballs courage to look its best.   When you roll your eyes, you command looks that say: “I’m different” especially at a dinner date.  Rather than wearing black lashes, men want to stare into eyes that are shielded under colourful lashes convincing them that a girl knows how to tempt a man to fall in love.
