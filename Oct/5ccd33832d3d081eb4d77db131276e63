A two-storey building yesterday collapsed at Butcher Line, Dilimi near Zololo Junction in Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State. The collapse came barely three months after a three-storey building caved in at the same area where about four persons died while several others were injured. It was that many people survived yesterday’s building collapse as there was no loss of life. A resident of the community, who gave his name simply as Nura, said the building collapsed about 3.04p.m. In Jjuly, when a three-story building collapsed in the same community, the state government ordered that buildings not properly structured within the metropolis be demolished. The state Deputy Governor, Prof Sony Tyoden, had during a visit to the collapsed building site in July, called on the Nigeria Society of Engineers (NSE) to be proactive in its professional responsibilities to prevent recurrence of such calamities. He said: “When people are constructing buildings they should make sure they get the appropriate authorities which is either Jos Metropolitan Development Board (JMDB) or the Ministry of Lands and Survey. The supervisory agencies should also do their own job. “And I’m also saying that from now onwards, Jos Metropolitan Development Board (JMDB,) the Ministry of Lands and Survey and the security agencies should move from street to street, identify buildings that are not properly structured, mark them for demolition; and we are going to demolish them.” It was also learnt that the JMDB officials had since July commenced demolition of buildings which were substandard which received support, especially from stakeholders. Meanwhile, government officials were yet to issue statement on the latest building.
