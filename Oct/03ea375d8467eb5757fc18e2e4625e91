The gory tales of the fire tragedy of last Wednesday in Upper-Iweka area of Onitsha in Anambra State was one preventable disaster too many. The Chairman of the House Committee on Emergency and Disaster Preparedness, Hon. Tunji Olawuyi, who stated this in a statement in Ilorin on Saturday, said the Committee was shocked and saddened by the sad event. According to him, the Committee is initiating an inquiry to unravel the immediate and remote causes of this preventable tragedy which has led to loss of precious human lives and enormous economic dislocation. The Committee, he said, is working in earnest with the leadership of the House of Representatives to unravel the factors responsible for the apparent dismal level of response of fire service officials in this index case, adding that the committee would not neglect the associated factors that occasioned the petrol tanker fire in the first instance. This inquiry, according to Olawuyi, would afford the Committee an opportunity to review countrywide disaster prevention, mitigation and response mechanisms, collaboratively with multilateral stakeholders.
