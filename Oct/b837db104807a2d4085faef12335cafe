T he ongoing group exhibition showcasing 47 paintings, drawings and ceramic works by three contemporary artists from Nigeria and Cameroon, ends this Friday October 18, at Temple Muse, Victoria Island, Lagos.   Titled STASIS, and curated by SMO Contemporary Art, the exhibition, which opened opens to the public on Monday, September 2, features recent works by Djakou Kassi Nathalie, Olawunmi Banjo, and Kelechi Nwaneri, who explore the meaning of balance and belonging in surreal physical and emotional landscapes.   The three artists originating from different parts of West Africa, one classically trained and two self-taught, with an age difference spanning almost twenty years, draw us into a complex dialogue from three radically different viewpoints. Through detailed paintings, layered and complex drawings, and experimental ceramic works, each artist explores the tension between the conscious and subconscious mind. Each artwork questions how to achieve balance despite societal pressures, mental health challenges, and the effects of climate change on our well-being.   “STASIS provides a creative platform for three artists with very different styles and philosophies to examine the concept of equilibrium and counter-balance, “commented Sandra Mbanefo Obiago, the exhibition curator and Founder of SMO Contemporary Art. “Kassi’s voluminous sculptural ceramics provide a fantastic counter-point to Banjo’s finely painted self-portraits and Nwaneri’s mythological, surreal landscapes.” “The diversity of media and artistic viewpoints are a refreshing start to our fall season,” commented Avinash Wadhwani, Director of Temple Muse. “STASIS touches on important global issues and we are delighted to provide a platform for artists to tell their stories from a contemporary African point of view.”
