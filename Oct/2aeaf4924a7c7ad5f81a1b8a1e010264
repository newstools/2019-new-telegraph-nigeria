Determined to improve the agricultural sector in Nigeria, the INNOSON Motors Nigeria Limited has established a tractor manufacturing plant in Nsukka, Enugu State. The tractor plant which is aimed at improving mechanized agriculture in the country is targeted at training youths in agriculture and providing the much needed machines to improve food production. According to the Chief Executive Officer of INNOSON Group, Chief Innocent Chukwuma, the programme carried out in partnership with the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), this would go a long way in encouraging our youths to go into agriculture. â€œA lot of people are already interested in this venture and even those that are into private or cooperative farm settlement; you know that Ebonyi and Enugu states have something to share in terms of agriculture, so it would improve food production in the South-East, South-south and even the North-East, such as Benue and Kogi states.
