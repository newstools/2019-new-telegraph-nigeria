National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus said though the Supreme Court has dismissed the petition of the party and its presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar challenging the election of President Muhammadu Buhari, the final judgement comes from God. Secondus in a statement by his SA media, Ike Abonyi, however, commended Nigerians for their commitment and support to the party and to democracy. He said that the commitment of Nigerians to democracy and its tenets despite inhibiting factors is worthy of emulation and highly commendable. “We thank you for your support for PDP, for your commitment to democracy. “Nigerians know that you voted PDP, even APC knows that you rejected them on February 23, 2019, international community knows you voted for PDP. “If the Supreme Court of seven justices says otherwise, leave it to God the ultimate judge,” Secondus stated. He also commended the media for their commitment to democracy and good governance in Nigeria and urged them not to relent in their roles of holding politicians accountable to the people. Secondus however charged Nigerians to remain resolute in their prayers to God, lamenting that “the country is in such an untidy state that only God can bail her out.”
