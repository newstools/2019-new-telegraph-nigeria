The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that the nightmare of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Bayelsa State would be over by November 16 when the party (PDP) would be defeated in the governorship election. APC stated this in a statement Tuesday in reaction to the allegation of the PDP that the opposition APC was influencing the list of Supervisory Presiding Officers (SPOs) deployed by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the governorship election in the state. The APC, which denied the allegation through its Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Nabena Yekini, revealed that PDP and its candidate Senator Douye Diri were doing everything possible to intimidate the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) into doing their bidding. According to him, the PDP and its governorship candidate were crying wolf in the face of its imminent election defeat, come November 16, just as he said the Bayelsa REC and its official rejected the bribe offer made to them by the PDP elements hence the call for the REC’s removal. Director of Media and Publicity of the Senator Douye Diri Campaign Organisation, Hon. Jonathan Obuebite had called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to withdraw a supposed list of SPOs and engage fresh hands from institutions outside Bayelsa state. But reacting to this, Yekini said: “The baseless allegation by the PDP and their governorship candidate is part of their plan to intimidate INEC and other critical stakeholders that will be on official election duty. You can see the PDP during their campaigns, they have nothing to tell Bayelsans following the failed administration of Governor Seriake Dickson, and so they have resorted to falsehood, rumours and crying wolf. “The popularity and wide acceptance of the APC governorship candidate, Chief David Lyon is giving the PDP sleepless nights. The PDP’s nightmares will soon be over when the Bayelsans vote them out on November 16.”
