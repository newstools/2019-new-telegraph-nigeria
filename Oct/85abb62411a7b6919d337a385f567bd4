The Chairman of Bayelsa State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Peace/Reconciliation Committee, Diekivie Ikiogha, yesterday, declared that the Epie Attisa people of the state have not endorsed any candidate for the forthcoming governorship election. The reconciliation committee chairman therefore stated that his party ss in good shape to face other parties in the governorship election. “There was no endorsement or adoption, but people just went to pay a courtesy call. APC will also go and pay courtesy call on the traditional rulers and they are going to also bless APC. That is a normal protocol within the traditional council and they do it everywhere. There was no adoption,” he said. Speaking to New Telegraph in Yenagoa, Ikiogha maintained that in order to make sure that the party was in good shape before the election; his committee has tried to reconcile all the aspirants except few cases, which the committee is still working on. He added that the matter in court would soon be resolved. He said: “We have tried to reconcile all the aspirants. There are two cases that Mr. President himself or the National Chairman of the party will have to handle, but as far as I am concerned, we are one big family. “And if you talk of integration, we are still making contacts. It is a continuous process even one day to the election. That is why we are going out to campaign. We will continue to make contacts and we solicit for supports.” He also stated that the issue of suspension and counter-suspension that rocked the party recently was due to misunderstanding, insisting that it has been resolved. Boasting that the APC will win the November 16 election, Ikiogha said: “If I were in PDP, I will be very cautious, if I were the governor, I would have been very cautious to spend money because the picture is glaring right now.”
