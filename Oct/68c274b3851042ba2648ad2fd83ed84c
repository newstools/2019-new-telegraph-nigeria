O yo State Governor, Engineer Seyi Makinde, yesterday said that the era of going cap-in-hand to beg for federal allocations would soon be over in the state. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, quoted the governor as making the declaration during a thanksgiving service held at the Living Faith Church, Bashorun, Ibadan. According to the statement, the governor further stated that the idea of relying solely on federal allocations would soon be a thing of the past in Oyo State, as, according to him, the State’s Internal Generated Revenue (IGR) would be drastically improved through enhanced tax collection procedures. “We want to ensure that the era of going cap-in-hands to Abuja to beg for allocation will soon be over in Oyo State,” he said. The governor also stated that his administration would continue to provide social amenities that would make the dividends of democracy get to all the people in all the nooks and crannies of the state. “We want the people of Oyo State to be able to have dividends of democracy right on their doorsteps,” he added. The governor explained that his administration is rested on four pillars, which included Education, Health, Security and Economic expansion through Agric value chain, adding that intervention lessons would soon be organised to assist the final year secondary school students in their WAEC and NECO examinations. “The four cardinal programmes of this government include education. That  is why free and qualitative education has come to stay in Oyo State. “For our WAEC Students, we should be starting intervention lessons for them shortly. “We also want to fix our health care delivery system and to improve the security system, as we want all of us to operate in a secure environment, so that we can be safe to pursue our aspirations.”
