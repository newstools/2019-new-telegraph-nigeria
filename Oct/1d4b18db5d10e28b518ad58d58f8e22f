The Kano Election Petition Tribunal has ruled that the gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Abba Kabir Yusuf failed to prove his case against Governor Abdullahi Ganduje in the March 23, 2019 elections. The Tribunal, which upheld Ganduje’s election, said that the cancellation that followed the Gama ward election and the subsequent rerun was not only constitutional but valid. The chairman of the three-member panel, justice Halima Shamaki, in a judgement read for over three hours at High Court, in Miller Road, Kano, dismissed the PDP’s petition seeking the nullification of Ganduje’s victory.
