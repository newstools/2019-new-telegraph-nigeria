The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has advised the All Progressives Congress (APC) to leave it from its self-inflicted problem. PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, who reacted to the accusation that the party was responsible for the N90 billion allegation against Vice-President Yemi Osinbanjo, described it as a mere hallucination and an exercise in futility. Ologbondiyan said the APC should rather do soul searching and stop pointing accusing fingers to every imaginary enemy. “Nigerians know that the problem is within. This is name-calling by the APC which lacks the capacity to manage its internal affairs. “Nigerians know that PDP has no hand in the stripping of the vice president of his responsibilities,” Ologbondiyan said.
