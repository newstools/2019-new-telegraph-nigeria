Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, on Tuesday, appealed to Nigerians to desist from running away from the country and stay back to solve its problems together. Abiodun, who spoke at the 59th Independence Day celebration which held in Abeokuta, asked the citizens to resist the temptation of seeking fortunes outside the shores of the country. The governor stated that greener pasture is a mirage, adding that citizens of the countries where Nigerians often migrate to did not run away but chose to stay back and solve the challenges of their nations. He noted that though Nigeria’s 59 years of political independence has not been all glowing, the citizens should thank God for keeping the country united in diversity. Abiodun charged Nigerians to put their nation first, adding that the nation will be better if everybody comes together as one and solve the country’s challenges for the greater good. He said: “Let me say that at 59, our dear country still has much work to do. What we must remain patriotic. We must put our nation first. We must realise that we are Nigerians before any other affiliation. “Because of this, we should have the love of this country, whatever responsibilities that we are entrusted with, we should discharge them with fervour and commitment. “It is worrisome that our people are migrating to other countries for greener pastures. While some of our current national challenge may make it tempting to seek fortunes outside our shores, we must also realize that these countries were once in our position with different challenges. “And indeed, more often than not, the greener pasture is a mirage. In any case, the citizens of these countries did not run away but stayed and solved their problems together. “I, therefore use this medium to encourage our people to come together as one and solve our challenges for the greater good of our nation. If we do this, our great nation will be better.”
