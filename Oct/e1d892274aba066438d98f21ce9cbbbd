Volatility in the economic and business climate has impacted negatively on the earnings of Total Nigeria Plc. Chris Ugwu writes  Operations have remained very challenging with enormous economic and securities issues. The effect of rapid devaluation has wiped out billions of naira in market capitalisation for Nigeria’s fledgling oil and gas companies. Sentiments for equities have been dragged down by weaker macroeconomic indicators, which stifled earning expectations and increased appetite for debt securities. Challenges of insecurity and other high costs of operations attributable to poor infrastructure have also continued to make the business operating environment difficult, especially the oil and gas sector of the economy. The industry has also continued to experience sustained pressure on its cash flows due to delay in payment of subsidies leading to huge expenses. In all of these, Total Nigeria Plc is not insulated as its share price movement has depleted considerably among petroleum firms and petroleum product distributors quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). It, however, still remains susceptible to the challenges facing the oil and gas business in Nigeria. Total has continued to get its fair share of the mixed fortune as it maintains fluctuations in its financials. The oil marketer, which ended the year 2018 with a marginal decline of one per cent drop in profit after tax for the full year ended December, ended the  third quarter of 2019 with a loss . Market watchers attributed the situation primarily to ongoing weaker global commodity demand and pricing environment coupled with the rising refining expenditures. According to analysts, the current overall results reflected Total’s natural vulnerability to volume slowdown due to harsh environment. The share price, which closed at N198.00 per share on November  30, 2018, recorded a dip in growth that when the closing gong rang on Friday, the company’s share price stood at N123.20, representing a decrease of N74.8 or  7.78 cent year to date. Financials Total Nigeria Plc ended the 2018 financial year with a marginal decline of one per cent in profit after tax, from N8.019 billion in 2017 to N7.960 billion in 2018. However, profit before tax grew by three per cent to N12.098 billion in 2018, from N11.795 billion posted a year earlier. While revenue grew by seven per cent to N307.987 billion in 2018 from N288.062 in 2018, cost of sales equally grew by six per cent from N258.766 billion in 2017 to N273.202 billion in 2018. However, the company began the year 2019 unimpressive with a record of a loss after tax of –N474 million, the first quarterly loss reported by the firm in over a decade. Similar to Q4 results, which were disappointing, the driver behind Q1 losses was elevated interest expenses due to uncharacteristically high debt levels. According to analysts at FBNQuest Research, Total avoided losses in Q4 only because of a substantial positive result on the other income line of N6 billion which offset an operating loss of –N4.4 billion. This income was attributable to delayed reimbursements under the Petroleum Support Fund. In Q1, interest expense advanced by around 2.8x y/y as short-term borrowings grew by 61 per cent y/y to N55.1 billion during the quarter. “Besides sales which increased marginally, all key line items on the P&L worsened on a y/y basis. Total posted a loss before tax and loss after tax of –N418m and –N474 million respectively. “The primary drivers behind the disappointing results were a 193 per cent y/y rise in net finance expenses to N1.8 billion and a double-digit increase in operating expenses to N6.8 billion. The only tangible positives for the period were a gross margin expansion of +581bps q/q to 10.5 per cent and a -2 per cent q/q fall in operating expenses. Compared with our forecasts, while Q4 sales of N77.4 billion were in line with our estimate, Total’s loss before tax of –N418 million significantly missed our N2.4 billion forecast,” they noted. There were no signs of respite during the half year ended June 2019 as revenue for the downstream  firm took a further hit in Q2:2019, dragging half-year performance to a despondent end. According to analyst at Meristem Research, sales of petroleum products declined by N4.11 billion (6.41 per cent), while Lubricant trading expanded by only N91.50 million (+0.68 per cent). On the back of these, the company witnessed negative Q-o-Q revenue growth of 5.18 per cent from N77.42 billion to N73.40 billion. For the quarter, revenue across Total’s three segments; Network, General Trade and Aviation either remained flat (+0.47 per cent) or weakened considerably (-25.19 per cent and -25.52 per cent respectively). Overall, half-year top-line performance came in 3.48 per cent lower at N150.83 billion. Gross margin softened in H1:2019, after a first quarter of unwieldy direct costs. Cost-to-Sales (CtS) declined at a much slower pace than revenue, as landing costs remained on the high, given higher freight costs and the demand for better margins by depot owners. Therefore, CtS surged to 88.91 per cent (vs. 86.41 per cent in H1:2018), dragging gross margin to 11.09 per cent (vs. 13.59 per cent in H1:2018). Operating expenses were not left out of the story, as they soared by 16.89 per cent owing largely to a 21.16 per cent uptick in administrative expenses. Overall, OPEX settled at N13.86 billion while operating profit declined by a whopping 61.31 per cent to N3.94 billion from N10.18 billion in H1:2018. Finance costs for the half year also surged by 133.30 per cent to N3.95bn on the back of a 53.47 per cent increase in Borrowings – majorly bank overdrafts taken by the Network segment. Pre-tax profit settled at N0.20 billion (H12018: N8.65 billion) after a N0.62 gain in Q2. Net Income also trended 97.71 per cent lower, coming in at N0.13 billion (EPS: N0.38 vs. N16.71 previously). Total Oil continued with poor showings at slipped into loss in during the nine months ended September, 30 2019 with record of loss after tax of N204.844 million loss for the nine months ended September, 30 2019 as against N7.665 billion posted in 2018. Loss before tax stood at N116.950 million from N11.439 billion posted in 2018. Revenue dropped marginally by two per cent from N226.914 billion in 2018 to N221.835 billion. However, cost of sales grew by 0.4 per cent to N196.739 billion in 2019 from N195.941 billion in 2018. Meanwhile, earnings per share reduced to N0.66 in September 2019 compared to N22.58 in September 2018. Profit deflators Addressing shareholders at a recent AGM, chairman of the company, Mr. Stanislas Mittelman, said: “The company has continued to experience sustained pressure on its cash flows due to late payment of subsidies resulting in huge financial expenses (high and unanticipated interest charges). All of these add significant costs to doing business, had negative impact on our sales and affected our profitability. In spite of the difficult terrain, our results are indicative of the commitment of the board and management to growing shareholder values irrespective of operating challenges.” Looking forward Speaking on the outlook, Mittelman said: “According to the World Bank, global growth is expected to slow to 2.9 per cent in 2019 and growth in Nigeria is expected at 2.2 per cent in 2019, assuming that oil production will recover and a slow improvement in private demand will constrain growth in the non-oil industrial sector. We envision that the year will present its own challenges but, I believe we are well positioned to overcome the challenges of the business environment. We envisage that 2019 will provide us with opportunities for growth and investment.” He noted that Total Nigeria would optimise the vast potential of its solar business in Nigeria to drive its growth and sustain improved returns to shareholders. Mittelman said the company would use solar power to power its 60 stations in order to ensure stability of import, logistics optimisation and maximisation of its solar business. He said the company had signed a 15-year power purchase agreement with a manufacturing company in Ogun State to provide 999k wp solar hybrid solution. According to him, with a combined capacity of 1MW and production of more than one gigawatt hour of clean electricity, the company recognises the potential of solar, hence its programme of powering its stations which have been equipped with solar to supply electricity. “We remain a brand of reference and leading energy solutions provider and we are confident that the company will continue to grow and even though the working capital reduced this year, we still remain conscious of our role in the Nigerian economy with the support of our stakeholders and shareholders and we expect to consolidate on our past achievements and deliver value to our shareholders as we are well positioned to overcome the challenges of the business environment in 2019,” Mittelman said. Last line The continued deterioration in Nigeria’s macro-economic condition has resulted in drop in earnings of many firms including Total. However, it is expected that the improvement in the micro economy would help reposition the company.
