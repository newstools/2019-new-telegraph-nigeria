The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has ordered a temporal freezing of 45 bank accounts belonging to three companies allegedly involved in smuggling of rice into Nigeria. The order was premised on an ex-parte application filed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Counsel to the applicant, Nosike Nicholas, in arguing the application, prayed for an order to freeze the accounts for 90 days. He anchored the application on section 60, Paragraph (B) of the Banks and other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA) 1991 as amended. He submitted that there was an ongoing investigation against the defendants who are customers of the commercial banks. According to him, transactions under the accounts can cause significant financial loss to the rice industries in particular and the Nigerian economy in general. The trial judge, Justice A. R. Mohammed, while granting the application, instead of 90 days, ordered for a freezing for 45 days. The companies whose accounts were domiciled with 10 commercial banks in Nigeria are Sun Sam A1 International Limited, Sun Sam International Limited and Sunchrist O. Trans Nigeria Limited. The court directed the head offices of First Bank Nigeria Plc., Stanbic IBTC Bank, Union Bank Plc., United Bank for Africa (UBA), Zenith Bank, Sterling Bank, Access Bank, First City Monument Bank (FCMB), Polaris Bank and Eco Bank Nigeria to freeze forthwith all transactions from those accounts for 45 days. The court held that the order of freezing will be pending the outcome of the investigation and inquiry currently being conducted by the CBN. It further held that the applicant can approach the court for extension at the expiry of the 45 days if investigation is not completed. The court consequently adjourned to December 12 for further hearing.
