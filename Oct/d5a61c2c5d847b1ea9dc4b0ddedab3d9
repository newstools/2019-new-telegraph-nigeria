Former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Timi Frank, has called on Nigerians to prepare for tough times ahead of the 2020 budget circle, noting that the budget document presented to the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari is a ‘scam’.
According to him, after a careful study of the content of the fiscal document, what the President submitted to the National Assembly shows that not only will Nigerians be heavily taxed, fuel subsidy removed and social investment programme will cease to exist.
In a statement made available to media in Abuja on Thursday, the political activist said from all indications, the 2020 Budget as  presented has nothing in stock for the common man.
He observed that since the APC’s administration came in 2015, national budgets have been increased annually but without concomitant positive effects on the lives of ordinary Nigerians.
He challenged the National Assembly under the leadership of Senator Ahmed Lawan and Femi Gbajabiamila to tell Nigerians the implementation level of the 2019 budget, just as he submitted that the current National Assembly would rubber stamp the 2020 budget as presented by President Buhari without asking necessary questions expected of a functioning and independent arm of government.
He said: “After careful study, I have concluded that this 2020 Budget is more or less a scam. It is not meant to rescue Nigerians from the current economic hardship that has sent more than 94 millions to below poverty line.
“It is a document without fuel subsidy, social investment scheme but a very high level of taxes. So, I urge Nigerians to prepare for the worst.
“Unfortunately, the country will miss the 8th National Assembly under Senator Bukola Saraki and Hon. Yakubu Dogara, who resisted many anti-people policies which would have scaled through against the express wish of Nigerians. Under the current NASS, it will, most definitely, be a ‘yes sir’ kind of National Assembly.”
