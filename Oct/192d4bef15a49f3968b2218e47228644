 Muritala Ayinla  The former Lagos State Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources, Mr Wale Oluwo on Friday tackled the Lagos State House of Assembly over the threat to issue a warrant of arrest on the former governor of the state, Akinwunmi Ambode, and four others who served under the ex-governor as commissioners. Oluwo said he was never invited by the House, contrary to the claim that he shunned invites sent to Ambode and other former commissioners. The House of Assembly had on Thursday threatened to issue a warrant for arrest on the Ambode, Oluwo and three other commissioners, who served under the ex-governor, saying that its decision followed two preliminary reports presented by two different ad-hoc committees set up by the House to investigate the 820 buses purchased by Ambode and to appraise the 2019 mid-year budget. The House listed Oluwo  and  former  Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Kazeem Adeniji (SAN), Commissioner for Budget, Olusegun Banjo and Commissioner for Finance, Akinyemi Ashade, alleging that the former commissioners had questions to answer in the probe of the 820 buses purchased by the former governor. But reacting to the threat by the House to issue arrest warrants in a letter addressed to the Speaker, a copy of which was made available to New Telegraph, Oluwo said there was no iota of truth in the claim that he was invited but “wilfully or tacitly avoided appearing before the Committees”. He said: ” I wish to state categorically that no invitation, oral or written, physical or virtual, was extended to me in person or through a third party, either directly or by substituted means, to any of my official and residential addresses, phone numbers or emails.” The former commissioner said he had nothing to hide and was willing to explain his side of the story, should the House extend the invitation to him.
