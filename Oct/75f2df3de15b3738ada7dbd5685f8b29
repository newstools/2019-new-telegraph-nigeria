 Niger State government has disclosed that it has taken steps to put an end to the continuous complaints of people about the attitudes of staff of the hospitals, saying “we have disciplined over 50 health workers in the various health centres across the state”. Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health, Dr. Muhammad Maikunsidi, on Tuesday while addressing journalists said the Ministry had to take these steps to cut down indiscipline among its staff. According to him: “The services of about six consultant doctors have been discontinued, five doctors have been disciplined while over 40 nurses and health attendants have been disciplined in various ways. “We have sacked several doctors while others are undergoing series of disciplinary measures. For most of them, we withheld their salaries and took way their off-days while for others, we suspended them. You know it is sometimes difficult to fire civil servants but we have devised various ways to discipline them. “For those who are not found on duty during their duty time, we send them to the rural areas and for those who are sent to rural areas and do not report there, we terminate their services.” He further disclosed that the state government could no longer take the complaints coming from the people about the attitude of the health workers especially while they are in duty.
