Onyekachi Eze, Abuja Fear of losing Bayelsa State to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the November 16 governorship election has prompted six governors of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to seek the intervention of former President Goodluck Jonathan. The governors, who met the former governor in his Abuja residence last Friday, pleaded with him to support the party’s candidate for Bayelsa State, Senator Douye Diri to win the poll. The governors present, it was learnt, were Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia); Engr. Seyi Makinde (Oyo); Dave Umahi (Ebonyi), Aminu Tambuwal Sokoto); Darius Ishaku (Taraba) and Senator Bala Mohammed (Bauchi), who is also the Chairman, PDP National Campaign Committe for Bayelsa State governorship election. The Director General  of PDP Governors’ Forum, Osaro Onaiwu, was also part of the meeting. Jonathan, who is from Bayelsa State, it was reported, did not have a very rosy relationship with the state governor, Seriake Dickson. It was also alleged that the former president was working for the APC candidate. This, a source at the meeting said, the former president denied. He quoted Jonathan to have asked: “How can I be working for the All Progressives Congress (APC) when I am a frontline stakeholder and a father of the PDP?” According to the source, the governors, during the meeting, pleaded with him to forget what might have transpired between him and Dickson and work for the success of the PDP in the governorship election. Also, he was told to support the PDP candidate notwithstanding any perceived grievances during the governorship primaries. Jonathan was said to have supported another aspiriant other than Senator Diri, but he promised to use his influence as a leader of the PDP, not only in Bayelsa State, to campaign for Diri’s electoral victory.
