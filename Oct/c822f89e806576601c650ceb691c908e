After spending 23 days in captivity, the six female students and two staff of Engravers College, Kakau Daji in Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State have been set free by their abductors. The students and staff were abducted by gunmen on October 23, when the kidnappers stormed the school around midnight to carry out their dastardly act. A staff of the institution broke the news of their freedom to journalists in Kaduna, adding that they were released in the early hours of yesterday (Saturday). The Kaduna State government also confirmed the cheering news. However, school sources disclosed that their release was made possible following an additional payment of N10 million ransom by the families on top of the initial N3.6 million paid for the release of the girls. But after collecting the money, the bandits refused to release their victims and instead made another demand for an extra N10 million. The staffer of the college told newsmen that the N10 million was taken to the kidnappers on Friday night, saying the money was raised by public spirited individuals.
