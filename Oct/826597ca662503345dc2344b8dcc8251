The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) has expressed worry over the delay by the Supreme Court, to constitute the presidential election appeal panel to hear the appeal filed by the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the February 23 presidential election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.
The coalition said its concern stemmed from the fact that the apex court has on or before November 11, to deliver judgement on the appeal, which it stated, is about 15 days away.
CUPP Spokesman, Ikenga Ugochinyere, at a press conference Sunday, noted that the appeal was filed before the Supreme Court about 16 days ago, and expressed the fear that if judgement was not delivered within the constitutionally approved timeline, the appeal could be declared “dead.”
He disclosed that the CUPP had written to the apex court through its lawyers asking for a date for hearing but received no reply.
“We approached the apex court for redress with the strong conviction that the court will right the wrongs; an expression of our deep commitment to the rule of law.
“But over 45 days after the tribunal delivered its verdict, the Supreme Court is yet to constitute the appeal panel.
“This development is very worrisome to the opposition political parties as critical stakeholders in the nation’s democracy,” Ugochinyere stated.
He blamed the delay in constituting the panel on the alleged pressure to jettison the age-long order of seniority in the composition of the appeal panel.
The CUPP had earlier raised alarm of plan to constitute a panel “in order of convenience” to hear the appeal, which was denied by the Chief Justice of the Federation, Justice Tanko Mohammed in a statement by the Director of Information, Soji Oye.
Ugochinyere said the plan was still alive, and warned that if allowed to succeed, it would destroy public confidence in the apex court.
