Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, yesterday approved the termination of the appointments of all his Senior Special Assistants and Special Assistants with immediate effect. New Telegraph investigation indicated that no fewer than 250 Senior Special Assistants and Special Assistants were affected by the sack of the governor’s aides. It was further learnt that the move to sack them might not be unconnected with alleged plans by the governor to consolidate his political structure for the 2030 governorship election in the state. The affected aides were from the 192 wards, 18 local government areas and the three senatorial Districts of the state. Meanwhile, a statement by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Osarodion Ogie, said: “This development is in line with efforts to reorganise the governance structure to enhance efficiency in service delivery to Edo people. Fresh appointments will be announced within the next 30 days.” Ogie, however, added that the state government offers its immense gratitude to the outgoing aides for their service to the state and assured them of continued cordial relations in the years ahead. He said: “They are hereby directed to hand over all government property and documents in their possession to the Office of the Secretary to the State Government.” Specifically, sources close to the Government House said the sack of the aides may not be far from the governor’s alleged perception of some of the aides as hobnobbing with the leadership of the Edo Peoples Movement (EPM), whose umbrella body has been a major ally of the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. Oshiomhole and Obaseki have been locked in political battle over the crisis in the state House of Assembly, where 12-member elect of the House of Assembly are yet to be inaugurated.
