The newly inaugurated Commissioner for Finance in Enugu State, Mrs Adaonah Kene-Uyanwune, has pledged to bring on board a regime of accountability, integrity and transparency. Speaking at a maiden meeting with staffers of the ministry, Kene-Uyanwune said the ministry would work on a new matching order that would be based on performance and optimal output. The state governor,  Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, had on Sept. 25 swore in 19 commissioners and seven special advisers and followed it up with the assignment of portfolios on Sept. 30. Some of the newly sworn-in officials resumed in their respective ministries on Monday. Recall that there had been a lull in the various ministries in the past few months due to the dissolution of the State Executive Council. Addressing the staffers of the Ministry, the Commissioner said, “This is a unique ministry; the bastion of financial support to the state government and we must work to provide the necessary support required for government to deliver democracy dividends to the people. “Government has entrusted on us the management of its resources and we must import accountability, adaptability and transparency in our services,” she said. Kene-Uyanwune said the ministry must work to deliver on the eight-point agenda of the state government which are employment generation, social services, rural development and security and justice. Others are education, investment promotion, agriculture and infrastructure. She appealed to them to leverage on the people around them to enhance performance, adding that hard work would be rewarded. Kene-Uyanwune stressed further that the capacity of the workers in the ministry would be enhanced through training and re-training.
