Sola Adeyemo, Ibadan Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, Thursday, tasked broadcast practitioners in Nigeria to always venture to surpass the vision of the founding fathers so as to bring development to the country. 
The VP gave the advice in Ibadan at the grand finale of the 60th  anniversary of the Western Nigerian Television (WNTV), now NTA, which held at the International Conference Centre of the University of Ibadan. 
Osinbajo, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, who stated that Nigeria was not just the first to have television in Africa but also before several European countries and China, said: “As we celebrate the establishment of WNTV, we also celebrate what is possible in our nation.We celebrate also what the vision, hardwork and the commitment to the public good can do.
“Like Ambassador Faroubi had said, the celebration of the phenomenon achievement in 1959 would be wasted unless we recognise that the achievement from then is an established shoulders for us to stand on. And that today, we can do more to realise the vision of Late Chief Obafemi Awolowo to build a people capable of excelling beyond his own achievements. 
“Every generation has its own historic responsibility to reach for the highest peaks that human capacity can achieve. Today, we are in most advanced moment in science, technology and innovation in human history. Today, every smartphone has the computing power than all the Apollo space ship had in 1959; so all things are possible and we are able. Let us be inspired by Papa’s word that our only limit is our imagination,” the VP said.
