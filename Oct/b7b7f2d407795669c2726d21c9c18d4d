People of Epe-Ekiti in Ijero Local Government Area of Ekiti State were thrown into mourning at the weekend when they discovered the decomposing body of a 17-year-old boy, Opeyemi Oluwafemi, hanging on a tree. The body of Oluwafemi, believed to have committed suicide, was found about 4.30p.m. on Saturday in a nearby bush opposite his father’s house. The teenager was said to have taken his life allegedly because of maltreatment by his father who repeatedly tortured him with dangerous objects at the slightest provocation. A resident, who craved anonymity, said the father was fond of maltreating Oluwafemi and his mother. According to him, the victims cannot go to bed without being assaulted every night. The source added that, the boy, who was planning to sit for his external examination, was beaten as usual and had to escape when he could no longer bear the pains. Subsequently, all efforts to locate him proved abortive and he did not return to the house as expected. However, the offensive odour and flies which took over the environment caught the attention of members of the community who later discovered the decomposing body of the boy dangling on the tree. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Caleb Ikechukwu, confirmed that the body was found hung on a tree in a nearby bush. He said: “I can confirm to you that about 4.30p.m., on October 26, 2019, the body of 17-year-old Opeyemi Oluwafemi was found on a tree in a nearby bush at Epe-Ekiti. “However, I cannot confirm at present if the father has been arrested but investigation is ongoing.”
