US President Donald Trump and the Queen have both sent congratulatory messages to President Muhammadu Buhari and the people of Nigeria on the nation’s 59th Independence Day celebrations. In his message, which was released by the US Embassy in Nigeria, Trump said: Dear Mr. President: On behalf of the American people, I extend our warmest greetings and congratulate you on the 59th anniversary of Nigeria’s independence. Nigeria is among our strongest partners in Africa.  We share common goals of expanding trade and growing our economic relationship.  We are allies in the global battle against terrorism, and we want to see Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa driven out of the region and other insurgencies like them dismantled.  The United States welcomes efforts by your administration to diversify opportunities for your talented, creative, and hardworking people to the benefit of both our countries, Africa, and the world. I am pleased that following our meeting last year, our Vice Presidents are also building on our longstanding history of cooperation.  I wish the people of Nigeria continued success as you mark another year of independence. Sincerely, Donald J. Trump. On her part, Queen Elizabeth said: “It gives me great pleasure to send your Excellency my congratulations on the celebration of your National Day, together with my best wishes for the happiness and prosperity of the people of Nigeria in the coming year.” The Queen’s statement was released by the British High Commission in Abuja.
