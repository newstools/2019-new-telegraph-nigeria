A controversial new study has claimed people should continue to enjoy steak, sausages and bacon as there is no proof red meats cause cancer. Researchers branded the evidence linking red meat with serious health problems as weak and that eating up to four portions of red and processed meat per week on average posed no risk. Their new guidance flies in the face of recommendations from health organisations including the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF), which warns to avoid processed meat altogether or eat very little of it, while limiting red meat to about three portions a week. The WCRF gathered a team of organisations – including from the World Health Organisation – to hit back at the latest findings, saying there is good evidence of a link between red and processed meat and bowel cancer. At present, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) recommends that anyone who eats more than 90g of red or processed meat per day should try to cut down to 70g or less, reports the Evening Standard. In 2015, the World Health Organisation’s International Agency for Research on Cancer said consumption of red meat is “probably carcinogenic” to humans, whereas processed meat is considered “carcinogenic”.
