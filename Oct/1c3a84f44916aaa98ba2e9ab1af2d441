The EU has agreed to extend Brexit until January 31, 2020, according to a tweet from the European Council president. Donald Tusk said the bloc would allow for a so-called “flextension” – meaning the UK could leave before the deadline if a deal was approved by Parliament, reports the BBC. It comes as MPs prepare to vote on proposals by Boris Johnson for an early general election on December 12.
