The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described the inauguration of Edward Onoja as deputy governor of Kogi State as a nullity.
This, the party said, was because the office of the deputy governor has not become constitutionally vacant.
PDP in a statement Monday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan also described as scandalous to the nation’s judicial system, that the Chief Judge of Kogi State, Justice Nasir Ajana, whose panel acquitted the former state deputy governor, Elder Simon Achuba, of any misconduct, was the one who swore in Onoja.
“The action of the Kogi Chief Judge has heavily jeopardized the integrity of the judiciary and (is) capable of bringing the institution to public disrepute if not immediately checked.
“Our party insists that the Chief Judge of Kogi State, in staging an illegal inauguration of Edward Onoja, as a deputy governor, while the office has not become constitutionally vacant, amounts to gross misconduct, which cannot be accommodated under our laws,” PDP stated.
The party said that this was a clear demonstration of “the reprehensible and sacrilegious design by Governor Yahaya Bello to entangle, drag down and corrupt the institution of the judiciary, cause a constitutional crisis, trigger mayhem and derail the smooth conduct of the November 16 governorship election in the state.
“This is because there is no way there can be two deputy governors in the same state, more so as the people of Kogi State had already registered their anger and resentment against this illegality in the public space.”
