Like millions of Nigerian football lovers last night, the antics of the nation’s U17 team, the Golden Eaglets in leaving it very late before subduing Hungary in their opening World Cup match apparently also kept Sports Minister, Sunday Dare’s nerves gagged. The Eaglets had fallen being to the Europeans early in the first half before an impressive second half rally ensured that they eventually won the match 4-2. But before the turn around many Nigerians had their blood pressure rising shocked at what they were seeing form the five-time winners. Watching the match on television in his house at Ibadan, Oyo State, the Sports Minister showed that he is also passionate about the ‘beautiful game’s when in a tweet after the game he confessed he had hardly been able to sit down during the encounter. “I was on my feet almost throughout the game. “I watched these boys train in Abuja and I knew they were a bunch of good players. We move on with lessons learnt. I am confident they will get better and stronger. We just saw the Nigerian football spirit back on!” he said in the tweet, which was accompanied by a picture of Dare standing in front of his television set wearing a national team jersey.
