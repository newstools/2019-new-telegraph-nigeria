Hoteliers in Imo State have complained about the system of exploitation and impunity that undermined the hospitality industry in the state in the last eight years and urged government to redress same to maximize productivity in the sector. In a petition to the Commissioner, Ministry of Tourism, Creative Art and Culture, Barr. Chijioke Nzekwe, the hoteliers, under the aegis of Imo State Hoteliers Association, lamented the sharp practices instituted under former governor Rochas Okorocha’s administration in which some government revenue collectors colluded with some members of the state judiciary to allegedly rip-off hotels in the state. The hoteliers urged the present administration to bring to an end the systemic corruption and impunity in the revenue collection engagements with hotels in the state. The petition signed by the Chairman of the Association, Mr. Chima Chukwunyere read in part: “In retrospect, I assert and without any fear of contradiction, that on the 28th of last month, a particular Magistrate gave a ruling against 52 hotels within three hours and one of these affected hotels was closed five years ago and the structure demolished three years ago.” Chukwunyere noted that the problems confronting the hospitality industry in the state erupted during the Okorocha administration wherein the former governor appointed revenue consultants with close ties to its officials. He regretted that the revenue agents unashamedly connive with some personnel of the judiciary to defraud unsuspecting members of the public and succeeded in running down some hotels in the state.
