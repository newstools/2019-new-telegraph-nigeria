In an effort to stimulate demand and engender competition in the stock broking community, the management of the Nigerian Stock Exchange had in September 2011 introduced ranking of brokers by transaction value and volume.  Market analysts have identified volume of transactions as a major challenge facing stockbroking firms in Nigeria.   According to them, there are a few stockbrokers working with these foreign institutions, who collectively control major volumes traded in the market.  Market watchers believe that the dominance of these brokers appears to be the reasons they are dictating the tune in the Nigerian market for now and so anytime they start buying, the bulls return and when they stop buying and take their profit, the bears take over again.   A former President of Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers (CIS), Mr. Oluwaseyi Abe, had in an interview with New Telegraph said the biggest challenge facing stockbrokers currently was low participation and low liquidity in the market.   “While the regulators and stockbrokers have been working hard to create new products such as the Exchange Traded Funds, the buy side of the market remains weak, especially from the local end.   “Meanwhile stockbroking firms have also had to grapple with spiraling costs arising from the recently introduced Minimum Operating Stand“Investor’s confidence is still low as a result of massive losses arising from the 2008 global recession, although this is being addressed. Quoted companies are also going through challenging times with regard to rising costs. This is affecting their dividend paying ability,” he said.
