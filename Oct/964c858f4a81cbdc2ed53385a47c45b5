The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) has accused the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of pressuring the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Tanko Mohammed, to accept a handpicked panel to sit on the appeal filed by the presidential of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 presidential election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. Coalition Spokesperson, Ikenga Ugochinyere, at a press conference Thursday, also accused the APC of sowing bad blood and discord among the Supreme Court justices. According to him, allies of the ruling party are pushing for a handpicked panel because of the consequences of allowing a fair and neutral adjudication of the appeal. “We are back on this matter because we have received reinforced intelligence that the age-long tradition of composition of a panel made of up of experienced justices based on their seniority is about to be breached. “This complaint is a painful road we would have avoided for the image of the Supreme Court but knowing the desperation of the people and their hate for decency and order, we cannot keep quiet knowing they regard the people with disdain,” Ugochinyere stated. The coalition had about a month ago, alleged of plans to elevate some judges, who sat on Atiku’s petition at the tribunal, to the Supreme Court and to bypass seniority in the selection of the appeal panel. Although Ugochinyere noted that all the justices of the Supreme Court are eminently qualified to sit on the appeal, he warned against the breach of the age-long tradition where the most senior justices were made members of the panel. He stated that the opposition would not support any move to tamper with the age long order of seniority, which have since 1979, been used in selecting most senior justices of the Supreme Court who sit on election dispute panels.
