A retired judge of the Osun State High Court, Justice Olamide Oloyede and an NGO, Virtues Unlimited Restorative Justice Initiative (VURJI), have dragged the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) before a Federal High Court in Lagos over the importation of a banned chemical, methyl bromide, into the country. The National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency, Nigeria Customs Service, Federal Ministry of Health, Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Justice were joined as co-defendants in the suit. The plaintiffs are asking Justice Oluremi Oguntoyinbo to compel the defendants to investigate, identify and destroy in a healthy and safe manner any methyl bromide, found in any part of the country.
They are also urging the court to declare that the alleged importation of the banned chemical substance into Nigeria  is unlawful and illegal. The retired judge and VURJI alleged that the chemical, which is an odourless, colourless gas used to control pests in agriculture with serious negative effect on humans and  environment, was imported into Nigeria by a Lagos-based company, Toon Consolidated Company Limited, pursuant to the license issued by the Nigeria Agricultural Quarantine Services (NAQS) without the permit of NAFDAC.  In a 32-paragraph affidavit filed in support of the suit and personally sworn to by the retired judge, she claimed that the agro-chemical had been banned in Nigeria because it was dangerous to human health and caused environmental hazards by depleting the ozone layer.
