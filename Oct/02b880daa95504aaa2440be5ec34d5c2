R Kelly’s lawyers are asking a judge to reconsider granting him bail because he is only able to see one girlfriend at a time in jail, according to US media.  The disgraced singer faces a number of sex-related charges in Chicago and New York, and was refused bail following a court hearing in Chicago in July. A request to reconsider granting the 52-year-old bail was filed on Monday in New York, where he is charged in connection with a racketeering scheme to sexually abuse girls, the Chicago Tribune has reported. The motion is reported to include the complaint that only one person unrelated to Kelly can visit him at a time over 90 days – so just one of the two women who lived with him before he was jailed can visit during that period.  The motion was filed by attorney Steven Greenberg, CNN reports, and states: “His visits are severely restricted; presently, he is only allowed one unrelated person to visit. “In other words, although he lives and has lived with two lady friends, only one of them is allowed to be on his visiting list, and after 90 days he is required to switch.
“No other friends or professional colleagues are allowed to visit. That is not right.” Greenberg also argued that Kelly is not a flight risk and does not pose a threat to his alleged victims. The R&B singer is detained in Chicago, so even if the New York judge – who is set to consider the motion on Wednesday – grants bond, the Chicago judge would also have to agree before he can be released. Kelly, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, was first arrested on sex-related charges in 2002 after a video allegedly showing him having sex with a 14-year-old girl was sent to the Chicago Sun-Times.  He was acquitted in 2008 after lengthy delays, in part due to the girl deciding not to testify in court, reports Sky News. However, police arrested him again in February and he has been charged with multiple offences throughout the year.  Kelly has pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him.
