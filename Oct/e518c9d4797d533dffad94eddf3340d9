 T he President of the Young Men’s Christian Association, Ibadan, Oyo State, Professor Olugbade Fakeye, has expressed concern over diminishing regard for humanity in our society, pointing out that there is need to seek for God’s intervention in the land. He made the observation during a breakfast fellowship held at the YMCA Center, Ibadan, recently.  Speaking at the event themed ‘YMCA: Service to Humanity, the Authority of Jesus Christ,’ Professor Fakeye said: “Going by the happenings in the social, economic, political and religious space of Nigeria, we need constant touch with the words of God; also, we need to seek spiritual intervention in our father land.”  He added that there was need to hold regular breakfast fellowship, to promte the four core humanitarian values of the YMCA namely respect, responsibility, honesty, and caring.  That, he added, will also help in putting Christian principles into practice by developing a healthy body, mind and spirit. Professor Fakeye finds a soul mate in the guest speaker and Minister in charge of Molete Baptist Church, Challenge, Idi-Odo, Ibadan, Rev. Edward Alibi.  He outlined the benefits of humanity and ministering saying: “People will thank God for your life, your good works can speak for you, God also will meet your own need, God’s kingdom will be populated by your actions and you will be able to do more for God.” “You will not lose your reward, when you call for help, God will send help for you also and you will share in God’s kingdom,” Revd. Alabi added. The cleric, however, regretted that this generation speaks much of loving Jesus, but acts so little in expressing the love of God, to the needy.  He said that God expects us to care for the needy, as he bring them along our ways, adding that we are positioned for a purpose. According to him, this is a wake-up call for the church and the need for Christians to be sensitive to the needs of others around us.
