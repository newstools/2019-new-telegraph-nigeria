Pauline Onyibe, Yenagoa As the Bayelsa State governorship election draws closer, the youth wing of the pan African group called Ohanaeze Ndigbo Bayelsa State chapter, has disclosed that they were yet to endorse any candidate stating that it will not support any candidate that will not keep promises. The OYW, however, said any endorsement by the group will surely encompass all the Igbo leaders in the state maintaining that a document that will bear the signatory of all will be collectively be made available for the endorsement. The Ohanaeze Youth Wing President Chief Arthur Chinedu Ugwa, who is also the coordinator of South South OYW, in a statement at the weekend in Yenagoa stated that: “As this election comes, we will not support anybody that cannot keep to his promise. We will make sure that we consult even to the grassroots and make sure that we are going to sign a document that every market union like Igbo traders/ community leader’s political movement, with Prince Williams Eze as the coordinator, among other groups will be part of.” The group said that any other endorsement outside the one that encompasses all the leaders of the various groups in the state was fake. OYW also thanked all that made the 2019 Igbo day celebration in the state a success especially the Igbo day 2019 celebration committee set up at the Top Rank Hotel who worked hard to see to the success of the celebration.
