   The Kano State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has condemned the kidnapping of nine Kano children who were trafficked to Anambra State and converted to Christianity. According to a statement signed by Kano CAN Chairman, Rev. Areyemo A. Samuel, the body said: “Kano State chapter of CAN received with utter shock the news of the kidnapping of the nine Kano children that were rescued by our gallant Kano Police Force from Anambra State. “We condemn the kidnapping of these children in strong terms. We, hereby, state categorically that CAN does not know these criminal elements and they do not have any relationship with CAN. “They are individuals with depraved minds and who have sold themselves to the devil. CAN does not in any way support criminal acts of any sort by any one or group of persons, hence we state clearly that the security agents should investigate deeply so as to know their accomplices whoever they may be and have all of them arrested and prosecuted without any delay and let the full wrath of the law take its course on them.”
