Stocks gained on Wednesday on a report that China could yet agree to a partial trade deal with the United States despite recent tensions, while the prospect of a last-minute Brexit agreement between the European Union and Britain seemed as remote as ever. Sterling was little changed against the dollar after losing nearly 1per cent over the past two sessions, while oil prices rose on trade optimism and after Turkey launched a military operatihere in northern Syria. China is still open to agreeing to a partial trade deal, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, despite the recent U.S. blacklisting of Chinese technology firms and reports on visa restrictions from both sides. “You don’t want to ignore headlines, but at the same time each headline seems to say the same thing – that both sides want to see something happen and both sides are encouraged that something may happen,” said Michael Lorizio, senior fixed income trader at Manulife Investment Management in Boston. According to Reuters News, markets have been wobbly this month on more evidence that the U.S.-China conflict over trade is increasingly damaging the global economy. Stocks have been particularly sensitive to headlines regarding trade. “There are expectations that some sort of an interim deal will emerge from these meetings,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. “Investors certainly seem more hopeful now than they did two days ago.” On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 146.5 points, or 0.56 per cent, to 26,310.54, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 20.08 points, or 0.69 per cent, to 2,913.14 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 65.51 points, or 0.84 per cent, to 7,889.29. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.40 per cent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.39 per cent. Emerging market stocks lost 0.17 per cent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.45 per cent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei .N225 lost 0.61 per cent. Meanwhile, talks between the European Union and Britain over an agreement to cover London’s departure from the EU on Oct. 31 appeared to be going nowhere.
