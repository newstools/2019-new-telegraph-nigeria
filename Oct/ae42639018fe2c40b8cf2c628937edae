President Muhammadu Buhari has attributed the herders/farmers crisis witnessed in Benue and other parts of the country on social and cultural factors. The President said that those who attribute the crisis to religion do not understand the root causes of it. President Buhari stated this yesterday when he met a delegation of Benue State Council of Traditional Rulers led by the Tor Tiv, Professor James Ayatse at the presidential villa, Abuja. President Buhari called for better appreciation of the historical relationships among various communities in order to sustain the nation’s unity. Senior Special Assistant on Media to the President, Garba Shehu, in a statement, said Buhari “decried the misunderstanding of internal conflicts by many people at home and abroad, citing the farmer-herders clashes, which in several places had been misconstrued as religious, when in fact they arose from social and cultural factors.” He restated his appeal for better understanding of the nation’s diverse cultures in order to engender a healthier co-existence among the people, while fortifying and strengthening the unity of the country.
