A 16-year-old boy, Paul Ikwechegh, a native of Igbere in Bende Local Government Area of Abia State, has allegedly sodomised a 10-year-old girl to death. It was learnt that the suspect took the deceased, who hailed from Nkporo in Ohafia Local Government Area of Abia State, against her will and raped her to death. The incident occurred on October 5, 2019, at No. 51, Emeonye Street, off Ngwa Road, Aba. It was also learnt that the anal penetration left the victim paralysed and hospitalised until she died on October 9. The suspect reportedly has penchant for taking tramadol. A source said: “I don’t know whether Paul got any help from any of his friends, but we discovered that he took the little girl to the place where he perpetrated the act. From what I learnt, he tried penetrating her from the vagina, but only he knows why he later decided to do it through the anus. “I learnt he consumed tramadol so much at his age. After the whole show, the girl was left paralysed, but she identified him as the culprit. The family rushed her to the hospital while the police arrested Paul. The little girl cried until she died on Wednesday. I don’t know whether she got the right treatment, but enough damage was done to her anus. He’s still with the police.” The state Commissioner of Police, Ene Okon, said the case was now murder and no longer rape. The commissioner said the police would do all within the ambit of the law to ensure that justice was carried out. He added: “The case was transferred to the State Criminal Investigations and Intelligence Department (SCIID) last week. But if the victim has died as information is saying, the charge will now be murder. Trust us that justice will be done.”
