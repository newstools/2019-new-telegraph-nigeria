Justice Josephine Oyefeso of an Ikeja High Court on Thursday fixed November 21 for the adoption of final written addresses in the ongoing criminal trial of a former lecturer of University of Lagos, Akoka (UNILAG), Afeez Baruwa.
The date was fixed Thursday after the defence counsel, Ms Taiwo Makinde, informed the court that they had just served the prosecution a copy of their final written addresses.
Baruwa is standing trial on a charge of raping an 18-year-old admission seeker (name withheld) in his former office at UNILAG.
The ex-lecturer committed an offence contrary to Section 258 of the Criminal Law of Justice, Laws of Lagos State, 2011.
The defendant was a former part-time lecturer in the Department of Accounting in the university when he allegedly committed the offence.
While addressing the court, the prosecuting counsel, Mr O. A. Azeez, told the court that the prosecution needed time to respond to the final written address of the defence.
According to Azeez, the former lecturer allegedly raped the victim at 9.25 a.m. on July 23, 2015 in Room 8 at the Faculty of Business Administration Annex building, UNILAG.
“Baruwa, who was a friend of the complainant’s father, was requested by him to help his daughter secure admission into the institution.
“The alleged rape occurred when the girl came into Baruwa’s office to make arrangements for her admission into the university.
“UNILAG authority has, however, put up a disclaimer in respect of the lecturer,” he said.
Meanwhile, four prosecution witnesses have testified against the defendant in the course of trial; including the complainant, her father, a medical doctor and the investigating police officer.
