Aspirants of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the forthcoming local government chairmanship elections in Ekiti State have petitioned the state governor Kayode Fayemi, the State Independent Electoral Commission (SIEC) and other APC stakeholders in the state over the postponement of the party’s primaries, which should have held last Saturday. The APC state Publicity Secretary, Ade Ajayi had via phone last Saturday confirmed to journalists, the postponement of the LG primary election citing security reasons. “Local government chairmanship primary election has been postponed in two local governments – Ado and Ikole for security reasons,” he said. But two contestants in Ado Local Government, Mr Gidado Tajudeen Olaleke and Mrs Tosin-Ajisafe Aluko expressed their displeasure on the development, describing the postponement as “unnecessary and undemocratic.” The two contestants, who also faulted alleged security reasons for the postponement, described the situation as embarrassing. The aspirants alleged that some people within the hierarchy of the party are playing some games which they said could be detrimental to the progress of the party.
