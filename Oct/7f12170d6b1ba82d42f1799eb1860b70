A statement signed by the Spokesman of the Force Police Headquarters, Deputy Police Commissioner, (DPC), Frank Mba, said that Rabo was rescued unhurt from the hands of the kidnappers late Sunday night. Mba explained: “The officer was successfully rescued this evening (Sunday) by a combined team of Police operatives from Kaduna, Niger and Zone 7 Command Headquarters Abuja, backed-up by members of the elite Special Forces of the NPF. “Two male suspects have been arrested in connection with the incident.” Mba stated that investigation into the incident was ongoing, adding: “The officer was travelling in his civil dress, with his private vehicle and without escort or any special security at the time of the incident. “He was not targeted as a cop. It was purely an opportunistic crime, indiscriminately and maliciously targeted at citizens using that particular road. He was, perhaps, positionally unlucky at the time of the incident.”
