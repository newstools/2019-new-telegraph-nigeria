Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state yesterday enjoined Nigerians to sustain their faith in the unity and capacity of the country to overcome its current challenges and realize its full potential as a prosperous country. He stated that only sustained synergy between the Federal Government and the states, as well as other stakeholders that would lead to victory against terrorism and other criminal acts in parts of the country. Ortom in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Terver Akase to mark Nigeriaâ€™s 59 independence anniversary said that the grace of God had moved the country out of challenges and threats to its corporate existence. He emphasized that what the people need to do at this critical time was to draw closer to God in their actions. Ortom explained that the recent successful crackdown on kidnappers and armed robbers in Ushongo was as a result of the effective collaboration between his administration, Benue people and the security agencies. While stressing that there would be no hiding place for enemies of peace as he would not surrender the state to criminals, Ortom reaffirmed the commitment of his administration to address youth restiveness by developing the agriculture-value-chain to engage young people in rewarding ventures. The governor commended people of the state for their support to his administration and pledged to return the goodwill with greater performance in all sectors of the economy. He noted that the recent steps taken by his administration such as signing of the Pensions Law and establishment of a Pension Commission were aimed at speedily addressing the welfare of those still in service and retirees.
