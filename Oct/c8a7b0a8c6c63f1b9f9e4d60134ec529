Actress Stephanie Linus shared a picture of herself in black on Wednesday via Instagram. “Fly gal #newlevels #specialday,” she said. Born on October 2, 1982, in Imo State, the movie director began her acting career in 1997 when she featured in the movies Compromise 2 and Waterloo. She was involved in a serious car accident that left her with burns and a broken leg in April 2005 on her way to the Africa Movie Academy Awards (AMAA) in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State. Stephanie’s first marriage of three years to former Super Eagles football player, Chikelue Iloenyosi, was declared null and void by the Lagos state high court in 2012, because at the time they got married, Chikelue was already legally married to another woman in the US. The University of Calabar graduate found happiness in another marriage after she wedded Linus Idahosa in Paris, France, at a private ceremony that was attended by members of her family and scores of Nollywood actresses and actors in 2012. On October 24, 2015, the 2002 Most Beautiful Girl in Nigeria runner up revealed that she had been delivered of a baby boy. Stephanie received special recognition for her movie, DRY, from the Los Angeles City Council in an event on February 5, 2019.
