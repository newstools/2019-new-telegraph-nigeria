… Says Obaseki is monitoring his movement   The crisis between the Edo State governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki and the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole took another dimension on Tuesday, as the APC Chairman accused the governor of planning to dump the party.  The party Chairman also accused the Edo State governor of monitoring his movement.  According to statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to the APC National chairman, Simon Ebegbulem, the governor is being envious of Oshiomhole’s popularity in the state.  The former Edo State governor, who alleged attack on his person at his residence in Benin city on Saturday, also accused the governor of making every effort to coerce him into giving him details of his movement in Edo State, just as he accussed him of plotting  something against him.  The CPS said: “The governor should stop being jealous of Oshiomhole’s popularity in Edo State. He is a man that is at home with his people haven performed creditably well as governor of Edo State.  “So each time he is around both men and women gather round him, particularly APC members and of course the youths.”
