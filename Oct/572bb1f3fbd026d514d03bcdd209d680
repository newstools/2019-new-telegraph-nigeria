By Pauline Onyibe, Yenagoa As the Bayelsa State governorship poll takes place in two weeks’ time, the Executive Director of a non-governmental organisation, known as Center for Transparency Advocacy, Faith Nwadishi has advised the candidates that are planning to cause electoral violence to channel their money towards doing proper campaigns instead of causing mayhem.
Nwadishi, who was speaking on Thursday in Yenagoa during a stakeholders meeting tagged towards credible November 16 governorship election, told the candidates: “That the money that you budgeted for buying arms, bribing security operatives, that money that you want to use to pay thugs or buy votes can be used for proper campaigns.
Speaking further she said: “That money you are spending, somebody gave it to you and tomorrow you begin to have political god fathers, and if you don’t deliver the mandate of the political god father you won’t succeed.”
The Executive Director, however, said that the most important thing was for the citizens themselves to agree that they need to have a peaceful election adding that people who are uses to perpetrate the violence were among them.
Advising the voters she said: “If you understand the kind of power you have, you won’t want to sell out your votes because selling it out means you have lost that power for deciding who is to be in position or deciding to say this is the agenda I’m setting for you.”
