The three indigenes tribes and original owners of Jos North Local Government Area of Plateau State, the Afizere, Anaguta and Berom have all rejected the imposition of the APC Candidates by Governor Simon Lalong as the Management Committee Chairmen of Jos North, Jos South, Barkin Ladi and Riyom LGCs.  The group, under name ‘Autochthonous Peoples of Jos’ which consists of the Afizere, Anaguta and Berom urged Governor Lalong to reverse the recent appointment of Management Committee Chairmen of Jos North, Jos South, Barking Ladi and Riyom local government areas of the state.   Addressing journalists in Jos, leader of the group, which comprises of the Berom, Afizere and Anaguta tribes, Hon. Mrs Theresa Kaze said the appointments were illegal and cannot be sustained under whatever guise. Hon. Kaze, who was flanked by other members of the group, said they are prepared to die for their people and heritage just the same way Governor Lalong is prepared to die for President Buhari. “We are equally prepared to die for our people and for our collective heritage just the same way Governor Lalong is prepared to die for President Buhari,” he said.  According to them said since Governor Lalong has said that the security situation had improved, he should direct the State Independent Electoral Commission to therefore conduct the elections in the four local government areas in the interest of peace, security and good governance.
