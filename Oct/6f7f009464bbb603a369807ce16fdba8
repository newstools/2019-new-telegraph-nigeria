According to Gbenga Shobo, Deputy Managing Director, First Bank of Nigeria Limited, “our Fintech Summit 3.0 is convened to set the tone for discussions that promote disruptions in the digital space, especially in the financial industry, as we recognise the opportunities for inclusive growth and influence of Fintech, not just in banking but also business operations across all industries. The 2019 edition of our fintech summit would build-up from the successes achieved in the last two editions.  “FirstBank, in the last few years, has used technology to deliver solutions to promote financial inclusion. With over 33,000 Firstmonie Agents in 36 states doing over N2 trillion worth of transactions, we are reducing poverty with our agency banking footprint. Our Firstmobile application has become the foremost mobile banking application in the country with over three million users doing over 14 million transactions monthly.   “It is one of the major gateways for Financial Inclusion where everyone can download the app and open an account at their own convenience! This was not the case a few years ago. “Our USSD channel, *894#, is also solving financial exclusion problems for those who do not have easy access to internet data. With over 8 million users today, transactions worth over N4 trillion have been consummated using this channel.”
