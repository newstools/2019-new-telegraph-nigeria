A retired official of the Ministry of Defence, Paulson Okechukwu Ogbonnah, was yesterday arraigned before an Ikeja Special Offence and Domestic Violence Court, Lagos, for allegedly stealing N92 million.  The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC arraigned Ogbonnah for allegedly impersonating a public officer and representing himself to be a serving member of the Nigerian Army, holding the rank of a Colonel.  The 58-year-old retiree, who pleaded not guilty, was arraigned on a three-count charge of obtaining money by false pretence, stealing and impersonation of a public officer.  The EFCC prosecutor, E. A. Jackson, said that the defendant committed the offences sometime between 2016 and 2017. The prosecutor alleged that Ogbonnah obtained N92 million, under false pretence, from Mr. Obinna Francis Onyekaokwu while trading under the name and style of O. Mojjede Nigeria Limited. However, the defence counsel, Aramide Adeogun, called the attention of the court to a bail application made on behalf of the defendant.  Justice Sherifat Solebo thereafter adjourned the matter till November 11, 2019 and remanded Ogbonnah at the correctional facility.
