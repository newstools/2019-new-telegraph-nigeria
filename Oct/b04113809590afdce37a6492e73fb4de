A head of the November 16 governorship election in Bayelsa State, the kinsmen of former President Goodluck Jonathan led by the traditional rulers from Ogbia  Local Government Area of Bayelsa State, have adopted the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, Senator Douye Diri. The people of Ogbia Local Government Area including indigenes reposed confidence in the capability of the joint ticket of Senators Douye Diri and Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo to improve on the developmental standard set by Governor Seriake Dickson. In their display of solidarity, business activity was put on hold to receive  the campaign train of Senator Diri at a rally in Otuokpoti,  Kolo and Ogbia the main town on  Wednesday. A statement by the Director of Media and Publicity of the Senator Douye Diri Campaign Organisation, Hon. Jonathan Obuebite quoted the indigenes and non-indigenes submission that movers and shakers of Ogbia politics are in PDP. The PDP, according to them, has been fair to the people of Ogbia Local Government Area, especially with the election of President Goodluck Jonathan as Deputy Governor, Governor, Vice President and President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Buttressing this views,  the Paramount Ruler of Otuokpoti, HRH Azibakayam Wongo on behalf of 17 others said the only way to sustain the present tempo of developmental progress in the state is to support the joint ticket of Senators Diri and Ewrhudjakpo as the next governor of Bayelsa state.
