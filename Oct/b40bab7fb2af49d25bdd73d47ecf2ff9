Dubai Fitness Challenge (DFC), which is the city’s flagship fitness initiative championed by His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of Dubai Executive Council, makes a returns with its third edition from October 18 to November 16. Featuring an exciting 30-day calendar of active events, sports, health and wellness programmes and more, Dubai’s residents and visitors will be fully energised and entertained throughout the month.  DFC remains a pioneer in that it celebrates inclusivity – a movement for all ages, abilities, interests and fitness levels. 2018 saw a striking 34 per cent increase in participation from the 2017 launch challenge, surpassing a million registered festival entrants.  Dubai Fitness Challenge aims to further permeate communities and break the 1 million mark in 2019 of young and old committing to 30 consecutive minutes of daily physical activity for 30 days of the festival. In keeping with the social spirit of this initiative, DFC’s success lies entirely in inclusive city participation – not just of the masses but most importantly of all the enabling champions across public and private sector.  Taking this citywide movement to families, friends, colleagues and communities with the commitment and support from DFC partners, the challenge also promises to make fitness easy and accessible to all, with a wide range of activities across two dedicated fitness villages, community-centric fitness hubs, free facilities and sport zones. In addition to fitness activities, DFC will place an elevated focus on health and wellness as part of its holistic offering this year.
