At least 360 inmates on Sunday broke out of Malam Bello-Mai’almajirai local reformatory centre in Daura, Katsina State. The inmates, who were reportedly subjected to deplorable and dehumanising conditions, escaped after breaking the burglary proof. However, yesterday, the police ordered the immediate closure of the centre. The state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Sanusi Buba, who inspected the centre in company with journalists and other relevant stakeholders, ordered the closure in Daura. He said that inmates were subjected to deplorable and dehumanising conditions at the centre. The commissioner, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), added that the condition of inmates called for urgent and serious concern, noting that the police would search the 34 local government areas in the state to unravel such centres. Buba explained that some of the inmates were handcuffed and compelled to sleep in unventilated rooms. He said: “We would mount surveillance to fish out such culprits subjecting children to servitude.” The commissioner urged parents, who took their children to the centre, to come forward with valid means of identification to claim them. He said: “No law in the country permits such inhuman treatment.” The Emir of Daura, Alhaji Faruk Umar Faruk, called on the police and other relevant security agencies to carry out thorough investigation on the issue. He urged the police to be fair and just in their investigation so that the culprits would face appropriate sanctions. The emir, who expressed shock at the discovery, said it was a surprise for such a thing to happen in his domain.
