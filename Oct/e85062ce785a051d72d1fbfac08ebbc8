     Anglican Bishop of Ngbo Diocese in Ohaukwu Local Government Area of Ebonyi state, Rev. Godwin Awoke, on Wednesday urged President Muhammadu Buhari to re-open Nigeria’s borders in the interest of the nation’s economy. Awoke said the people of Nigeria were passing through pains, sufferings, economic loss and hardship as result of the border closure and appealed to the President to immediately re-open the borders. He spoke during first session of the Fifth Synod of the Church of Nigeria, Ngbo Diocese. He, however, commended the Federal Government and organised labour for reaching agreement on the protracted impasse over consequential adjustment arising from the new N30,000 minimum wage and called on the federal and state governments to  ensure speedy implementation and payment of the new minimum wage to ameliorate workers’ sufferings. He frowned at lopsided appointment of key political office holders in the country resulting in marginalization of some ethnic groups saying: “Such lopsided appointments also offends the principles of federal character and affects the unity of the country.”
