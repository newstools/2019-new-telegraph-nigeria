Enugu State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that the return of First Lady, Aisha Buhari to the country has put paid to avalanche of fake news being churned out by unscrupulous persons in the last few days.  Mrs. Buhari has been away from the country for two months until she returned to the country at the weekend. Until her return, the social media were agog with news of a plan by President Muhammadu Buhari to marry his Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Hajiyya Saddiya Farouk. This, the presidency, however, denied plans by the President to marry the Minister.  Addressing journalists yesterday, the Enugu State Publicity Secretary of APC, Mrs. Kate Ofor welcomed wholeheartedly the return of Mrs. Buhari to Nigeria, saying her return had put a full stop to fake news.  Ofor said: “I wholeheartedly welcome our dear First Lady back to the country, for her elegant return has put full stop to fake news which dominated our public domain. Methinks we have to not only find legitimate means to curb fake news, but also to come to terms that social media have no gatekeeper. Therefore, we must cultivate the culture of sieving the genuine from the fake news.  “Is it rational for people to jump into conclusions when Mr. President has not circulated any Wedding invitation? Why should they drag the name of innocent Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Sadiya Farouk into the mud?”
