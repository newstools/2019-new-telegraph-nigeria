An Alfa (Islamic Cleric), Awojobi Ganiu, was on Thursday sentenced to two years in prison for defrauding a United States-based businesswoman, Mrs Oluwatoyin Akinwole of the sum of N37.6 million. The Islamic cleric was convicted following a plea bargain agreement after being re-arraigned by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) before an Ikeja Special Offences Court, Lagos. Ganiu, who was docked alongside a self-acclaimed oil marketer, Adesanya Olufemi Paul, pleaded guilty to an amended charge of stealing and obtaining money by false pretence. The duo were alleged to have defrauded the businesswoman, leaked her nude pictures on social media and thereafter reported that she committed suicide by jumping over the Third Mainland Bridge, Lagos in 2017. When the charges were read, during Thursdayâ€™s proceedings, Ganiu, who was the second defendant, pleaded guilty but the 1st defendant (Paul) still maintained his not guilty plea. The Alfa was thereafter convicted after he pleaded guilty to two out of four count amended charges of stealing against him.
