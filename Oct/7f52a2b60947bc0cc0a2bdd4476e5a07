Celebrated Nollywood actress and filmmaker, Judith Audu, has concluded the shooting of a documentary on breast and cervical cancer awareness. Titled “Tame the silent Killer”, the actress says documentary, put together by an all-female crew, was inspired after she lost a friend to breast cancer as well as realising that cervical cancer is preventable. In light of that, the actress embarked on a campaign to enlighten people about the dreaded killers of many women across the world, especially Nigeria, leading to shooting the documentary. “It was a very painful loss for me and for the loved ones she left behind. It was even more painful when I came to realise that is one more death that could have been avoided, if she had acted on it immediately she was diagnosed. I got to also discover breast and cervical cancer is the number 1 killer of women at the moment in Nigeria, it is a problem hitting women and because of how personal the parts we are talking about is, I decided to put together an all-female crew to do this documentary so women would feel free to talk about it,” she said. Speaking further, Audu further noted that breast and cervical cancer top the list of medical conditions responsible for the death of women in Nigeria.
