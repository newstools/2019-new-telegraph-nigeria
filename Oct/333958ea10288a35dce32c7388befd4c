Lightning has struck and killed eight cows in Ikare-Akoko in Akoko North East Local Government Area of Ondo State. This came a few weeks after a similar occurrence was recorded at Ijare in Ifedore Local Government Area of the state where about 36 cows were killed by lightning. However, it was learnt that instead of disposing them, herdsmen, who own the dead cows, roasted them and started selling them to unsuspecting butchers in Akoko area. But the state government banned the sales of the meat from the dead animals. The Director of Environmental Health Services in Akoko North East Local Government Area, Mrs. Yemisi Adeniyi, and her counterpart in Akoko North West, Mr. Ojo Anthony, said they had arrested some butchers who were taking the cow meat to markets. The environmentalists, who mobilised other experts yesterday morning to the scene of the incident, seized the cow meat for immediate fumigation. The health experts therefore cautioned the people of Akoko to stay away from cow meat in the next few days to avoid consumption of the cow meat killed by the lightning. Also, the Chairman of Butchers’ Association in Ikare, Mr. Kabiru Ismaila, said he was working with government’s environmental health officials to ensure such cow meat was not sold in Akoko markets.
