The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) yesterday said it has suspended supply of fertilizer to victims of last year’s flood disaster and Fulani herdsmen attack in Benue and 17 other states of the federation through its Emergency Agricultural Intervention (EAIS) Scheme.  Deputy Director of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Dr. Ejike Martins disclosed this in an interview with journalists in Makurdi, Benue State, when he visited the Executive Secretary of Benue State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Mr. Emmanuel Shior. Ejike who said that 17 other   states where the Federal Government’s intervention is also applied are equally affected, further said that only five out of 23 local government areas in Benue State were captured in the distribution of the farm input, while 18 others were outstanding before the order came. He disclosed that 39, 927 bags of fertilizer were distributed in those local government areas, with a balance of 75, 709 bags for the remaining 18 councils.   “It is a national directive to suspend for now and when government says suspend, it has a lot of implications and interpretations. It could be a review of the programme, nobody can predict what government wants to do but the government is the owner of the work so they said for now, suspend.”
