Super Eagles forward, Emmanuel Dennis, will be aiming to add Paris Saint Germain to the list of big teams he has scored against as Club Brugg welcome the French club in Tuesday’s UEFA Champions League. Dennis, who netted a brace in matchday 2 of the Europe competition against Real Madrid in their 2-2 draw at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium on October 1, will be hoping to re-enact the performance against PSG. A win for the Belgian club against a PSG side that would be aiming for the maximum point could brighten their chances of qualifying from the group. Indeed, Brugge are now 10 Champions League games unbeaten including those qualifiers, while in the competition proper you have to go back to matchday two last season for their last defeat – a run of six games. Five of those games, including both so far this season, have ended all square, though, while stretching even further back Brugge have only won three of their last 20 outings in the Champions League proper.
