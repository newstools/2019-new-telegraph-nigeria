BOOST Nigeria is generating more revenue from gas export   E leven vessels left Onne Port with 680,000 metric tonnes of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) valued at N217.6 billion ($596. 36 million) between August and September, 2019. The shipment was 71.5 per cent of the June and July  export  Some 947,000 tonnes were exported in the period.   The gas was ferried out to various destinations from the LNG’s Bonny Island liquefaction plants, Rivers State.  The country’s major buyers are Spain, France, Portugal and Italy in Europe, Turkey, Mexico and the United States of America.  In September, four vessels ferried out 282,000 tonnes of the gas with LNG Finima II leading with 77,000 tonnes; LNG Kita, 70, 000 tonnes and LNG Maran Gas, 70,000 tonnes and LNG Adamawa, 65,000tonnes.   Statistics by the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA)’s shipping position also revealed that  398,000 tonnes were lifted  August  by LNG Abuja II with      77,000 tonnes,  LNG Cabtillo De with 70,000 tonnes; LNG Oyo, 68,000 tonnes; LNG Maran Gas Chios, 70,000 tonnes; LNG Hoech Gannet, 70,000 tonnes; LPG Continental, 30,000tonnes and LPG Navigator, 13,000 tonnes.  The NPA data showed that gas export from Nigeria to Europe and Asia had been on the increase since the beginning of the year.  In the last eight months, the price of LNG in Asia reached $877 per metric tonne following stiff competition among gas producers.  Already, global liquefied natural gas demand has risen by 35 million tonnes in 2019 as Nigeria accounts for over 50 per cent of the current LNG production capacity in Africa, following the $12billion expansion of the country’s liquefaction plant at Bonny Island in Rivers State.  Record of the shipments indicated that a total of 1.35 million tonnes of natural gas were exported between June and August, 2019.   The data further revealed that between June and July, 2019, 14 vessels left the port with 947, 000 metric tonnes of the gas.  It was learnt that the surge in export of the product was as a result of the high demand driven by rising Chinese imports.   China’s imports of liquefied natural gas increased in March, 2019, as demand remained robust, according to a data released by the China General Administration of Customs.  Between January and July, 2019, the country exported some 2.85 million tonnes of the natural gas to various countries.  The data indicated that nine vessels left the port in July with 585,000 tonnes of the gas.  The figure was 38.12 per cent higher than the June export.  Of the 585,000 tonnes, LNG Lagos II lifted 77,000 tonnes; LNG Bonny II, 77,000 tonnes; LNG Lokoja, 68,000 tonnes; LNG Borno, 68,000 tonnes; LNG Maran Gas , 70, 000 tonnes; LPG Navigator, 13, 000 tonnes; LNG Rivers, 65,000 tonnes;        LNG Adamawa, 65,000 tonnes  and LNG Abalamabie, 77, 000 tonnes.
