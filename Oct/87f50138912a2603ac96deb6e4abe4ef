As the nation’s external reserves continues its recent downtrend, dropping to $40.8billion as at October 22, 2019, analysts at Cowry Asset Management Limited have predicted a weakening of the naira across all market segments. In a report released last Friday, the analysts said: “In the new week, we expect depreciation of the Naira against the USD across the market segments amid decreasing external reserves.” According to data obtained from the CBN, in Q3-19 alone, the country’s external reserves declined by $3.2 billion, to stand at $41.7 billion. Specifically, in September, the reserves recorded a drop of $1.76 billion. The reserves depleted by $2.9 billion between August and September 2019. Indeed, the reserves, which stood at $45 billion on July 25, 2019, declined by $4.2billion to settle at $40.8billion as at October 22, 2019. However, Cowry Asset analysts noted that despite the falling  external reserves, the naira/USD exchange rate was unchanged at the Bureau De Change market at N358.00/$ last week. Similarly, the naira was unchanged against the dollar at the parallel markets, closing at N360 per dollar. The analysts further stated: “The naira remained flattish against the US dollar at N358.13/USD at the Interbank Foreign Exchange market amid weekly injections of $210 million by CBN into the foreign exchange market via the Secondary Market Intervention Sales (SMIS), of which $100 million was allocated to Wholesale SMIS, $55 million was allocated to Small and Medium Scale Enterprises and $55 million was sold for invisibles.”
