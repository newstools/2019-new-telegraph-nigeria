    Barely one week to the end of their tenure, suspended local government chairmen in Ogun State were, on Thursday, reinstated by the state House of Assembly. The chairmen, who were in charge of the 20 Local Governments and 37 Local Council Development Areas of the state, were suspended on May 31 following allegations of financial misappropriation upon the emergence of the Governor Dapo Abiodun administration. The council helmsmen were elected in October, 2016 under the administration of the immediate past governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun. At its plenary held in Abeokuta on Thursday, the state legislature passed a resolution, directing the reinstatement of the local government chairmen. The passage of the resolution came shortly after Hon. Akeem Balogun presented his committee’s report and moved the motion for its adoption, which was seconded by Hon. Bolanle Ajayi and supported by the Whole House through a voice vote. New Telegraph learnt that after the Assembly’s various investigations, the House noted in its report that all the local governments were short-changed in allocation from the Federation Account under the Amosun regime.
