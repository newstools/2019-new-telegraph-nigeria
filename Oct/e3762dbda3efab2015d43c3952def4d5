Emmanuel Onani, Abuja The President of the Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN), Comrade Eriyo Osakpamwan,  has expressed confidence in President Muhammadu Buhari’s capacity to take the country to a height of prosperity and development. According to the RTEAN President, all that was required to make Nigeria assume a pride of place in the comity of nations, was for the citizens to lend their total support to the policies and programmes of the Buhari-led administration. Osakpamwan said his conviction about a greater country, was reinforced in the President’s Independence Anniversary speech. He said the President’s pledge to continually strive for a peaceful and secure nation, must be applauded, more so that no meaningful could be achieve under an environment devoid of peace. The road transport president identified the reinstatement of the Ministry of Police Affairs, as well as the directive for the recruitment of 10, 000 police personnel, as some of the bold steps towards addressing issues of insecurity besetting the nation. Also, Osakpamwan pointed to the revolution going on within the transportation sector, with particular emphasis on the almost completed Lagos/Ibadan rail and Ibadan – Kano among others. He has, therefore, enjoined members of RTEAN across the country, to lend their support to the current administration, in its determination to take the country to the next level.
