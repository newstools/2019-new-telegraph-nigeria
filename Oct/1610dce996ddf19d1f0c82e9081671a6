 Akeem Nafiu A group of car dealers in Lagos State have threatened to drag the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) to court over  unlawful sealing of their business premises. In a letter to the Comptroller General of the Nigeria Customs Service, Col. Hameed Ali (rtd), through the law firm of Ubani & Co, the group condemned the September 30, 2019 raid and sealing up of their business premises by customs officers saying the action was a demonstration of gross irresponsibility, unprecedented impunity and abuse of power. They maintained that all the cars in their business premises were duly cleared and appropriate duties paid to the federal government. The group consequently threatened to drag the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) to court if their business premises were not opened in the next two weeks with a compensation of N10 billion for their losses during the period of closure. Copies of the letter were sent to the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila and the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN).
