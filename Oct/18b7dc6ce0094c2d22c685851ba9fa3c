When I complied with their order, one of them pulled out his sword and cut off my hand.   “After cutting off my hand, they told me to go home. They took the hand and ran away.”   Zeku, who also sustained machete cuts on her head, was currently receiving treatment at the Federal Medical Centre, Apir in Makurdi.   The Chairman of Guma Local Government Area, Mr. Anthony Shawon, refused to pick his calls to get his reaction on the matter.
