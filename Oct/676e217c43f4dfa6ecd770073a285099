As part of its contribution to the MenStar Coalition, the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) has announced an investment of $25 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, dedicated to scaling HIV self-testing. The Catalytic Fund will be made available to a few countries including Nigeria.  CIFF announced the contribution at the Global Fund Replenishment Summit, which was hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron in Lyon, France.  According to Miles Kemplay, Executive Director for Adolescence at CIFF, CIFF was championing HIV self-testing and other methods to promote self-care as one of the most powerful ways for youth, women and men to take control of their sexual and reproductive health. Kemplay said: “People deserve the choice to test when they want, where they want and how they want.”  According to a statement from CIFF, the impact of self-testing may be greatest in sub-Saharan Africa, which has the largest number of people living with HIV who do not know their status. Paulyne Chemeli, a Nairobi pharmacist stated that distributing self-test kits is: “improving the uptake of HIV testing among individuals who require confidentiality or who do not trust healthcare workers. Thanks to HIV self-testing, we now have more male clients and we encourage them to take at least two self-testing kits, including one for their partner.” The first step to access the fund will be to engage policymakers and implementers in countries likely to be eligible to motivate them to apply in due course. Once the selection process is complete, the governments of the selected countries will need to develop robust strategies and operational plans to be able to access financing. The CIFF – Global Fund partnership is designed to increase funding for country programmes that have ambitious HIV self-testing goals as well as put supportive policies in place for people to easily access self-tests.
