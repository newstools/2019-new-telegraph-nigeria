Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arrested a 53-year-old man, Muhammed Bolaji Abdulraheem, for allegedly parading himself as a lawyer and obtaining money under false pretence. Abdulraheem, who was apprehended by the Ilorin Zonal Office of the EFCC, was accused of using dubious means to defraud his client, Mallam Yusuf Bello, of N300,000. Bello, in his petition to the EFCC which was assigned to Counter Terrorism and General Investigations Section of the commission, alleged that Abdulraheem recovered the N300,000, from his debtor and claimed that the money was in the custody of the EFCC. When confronted with the complainant, the ‘lawyer,’ however, confessed that the money was never brought to the EFCC and neither did the commission know anything about it. The story took a new dimension on Monday, when the suspect, in a dramatic way, destroyed his statement where he admitted that he was called to the Nigeria Bar and had been practicing the legal profession for more than two decades. This happened when the commission discovered that the suspected fake lawyer never finished from the Nigerian Law School as he failed the prescribed examinations twice. The suspect, EFCC said, would soon be charged to court.
