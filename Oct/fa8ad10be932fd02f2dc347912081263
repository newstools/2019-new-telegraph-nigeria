G olden Eaglets have been advised to work on their scoring abilities if they are to go far in the upcoming FIFA World U-17 Championships to be hosted by Brazil.  The advice came from Sao Paulo’s Coach Marcos Vizolli who charged the Nigerians to be better prepared for the World Cup.  Sao Paulo youth team on Monday evening defeated the Nigerians 2-1 despite dominating possession and creating several chances.  Manu Garba’s team were the better side for most part of the game but had only  a penalty converted by Olakunle Olusegun in the 70th minute to show for their display.  “It was a really good game, Nigeria tried to dominate the midfield, they tried to score but they couldn’t, they missed four times in the first half,” Marcos Vizolli said.  “In the second half, Nigerians were also better, they dominated the game and tried to work a lot with the wingers but they couldn’t score another goal.  “They conceded in the second half because the midfield lost the ball. The result is not so important, the importance is the level and the intensity of the game which will prepare them for the World Cup.”  The Golden Eaglets and South Korea will meet in another friendly on Wednesday, October 16.
