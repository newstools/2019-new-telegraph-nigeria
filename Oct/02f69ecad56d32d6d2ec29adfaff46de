She may look like a grandmother — but a 67-year-old woman in China is believed to be the country’s oldest new mom after giving birth to a healthy girl. The sexagenarian, who was only identified by her surname Tian, welcomed her bundle of joy Friday at Zaozhuang Maternity and Child Health Hospital via cesarean section, according to CNN. Tian, a retired doctor who’d worked at the same hospital in the Shandong region, naturally conceived after taking traditional Chinese fertility treatments, a hospital spokeswoman told the network. “We were quite lucky, given that the mother was at an advanced maternal age and had a variety of complications,” Chief Physician Liu Chengwen told the state-run CCTV Plus. The fact that the mom’s reproductive system was in great shape likely contributed to her ability to get pregnant late in life. “When we examined the woman’s reproductive system during her labor, we found that she, unlike most other women in their 60s who have withered ovaries, has ovaries similar to that of women in their 40s,” said Chengwen. “That’s probably one of the reasons she was able to conceive naturally.” Tian and her husband, 68, are believed to be the oldest couple in the country known to have naturally conceived a baby, CCTV said. They learned they were pregnant during a routine checkup in May. Tian’s pregnancy was not without complications, however. She suffered from severe preeclampsia, heart failure and abnormal liver and kidney function — which is why doctors opted to deliver via C-section. Their healthy baby girl weighed 5.6 pounds at birth, reports The New York Post.
