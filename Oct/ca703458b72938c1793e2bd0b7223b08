The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has announced that members of the group protesting against President Muhammadu Buhari’s visit to South Africa were yesterday attacked by the South African Police. Though the group did not give the figure of fatality, a statement signed by its spokesman, Comrade Emma Powerful described the incident as “barbaric and disgraceful” . He said that the attack against peaceful IPOB protesters by South African police is proof that state-sanctioned politics of savagery has taken firm hold in Cyril Ramaphosa’s South Africa. “This is a thoroughly ugly and distasteful development that pales the White apartheid regime into insignificance in terms of its brutality and incredulity,” the statement said. The statement regretted that the display of police brutality and anti-democratic antecedents of the South African police are confirmation if any is needed, ‘that black Africa is hopeless and doomed’ under leaders of the two countries. IPOB alleged that there is a conspiracy of silence playing out in the African sub-region in exchange for yet unspoken gratifications.
