 Former President of the Senate, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, has challenged politicians of the older generation in Benue State to give the youth a chance. Senator Ayu stated this recently in Abuja at an event organised by OnTiv Professional Association, a Non-Governmental Organisation with the objective of fostering the unity and development of the Tiv people. Ayu said: “We have played our part. It  is time for many of us to pass the torch to support the younger generation and be a little bit less partisan. That’s the role we need to play. We also were tutored by elders. “The political leadership needs to work together. It is important for our leaders to put partisan interest once elections are over to be able to achieve.” Ayu, who commended the OnTiv professional group for bringing Tivs together said: “What they are doing need all our support. Development cannot be left to government alone. “The Tiv have in the past been able to organise development through self-efforts. Our own manpower development today is second to none. And this has been through self-efforts. I think, if we unite, the Tiv like the Israeli nation in the middle east, there is no force that can defeat us. It is only when we are divided that we can be defeated.”
