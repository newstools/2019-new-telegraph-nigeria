 T he Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described as disgraceful and lack of managerial ability of President Muhammadu Buhari, the open fight between the First Lady, Aisha Buhari and President Buhari’s  cousins, over rooms in the presidential villa. The party noted that the open fight has exposed the president’s leadership failure.  The PDP, in a statement yesterday by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, further said that such has highlighted why Buhari has failed in delivering on governance in the last five years.  “The feud further uncovers the impunity, disorderliness and vanity that pervade the Buhari presidency and how the once serious and productive seat of power has been turned into a house of comedy and an overcrowded  quarter for illegal occupants.  “Nigerians can now see why it has become difficult for our nation to witness any stability or progress under the Buhari presidency and why the Buhari-led Federal Government has been bedeviled by confusion, infighting, policy flip-flops, statutory violations, promotion of  violence, ingrained corruption and administrative indolence while millions of Nigerians wallow in poverty and neglect.  “Nigerians and the world can equally see why no one expects the Buhari presidency to articulate any progressive idea or proffer and implement any solution to the myriad of economic and security problems it caused our nation; they can now see why there is no hope in sight and why compatriots are daily agitating for a new order.”  “Our party notes that our dear nation has suffered enough disgrace from the Buhari presidency and the All Progressives Congress (APC),” the party stated.  It demanded an immediate apology from President Buhari to Nigerians for his failures and asked him to vacate office since it has become obvious that he is leading the country to nowhere. “Furthermore, the PDP urges the National Assembly to investigate the alleged abuse of office by President Buhari following revelation that he assigns official facilities in the presidential villa to unauthorized persons that have no official roles in governance, and apply appropriate sanctions” the party added.
