From Cajetan Mmuta, BENIN A late Saturday night fire razed the popular Santana Market, located along the busy Sapele Road in Benin the Edo State capital.
Sadly, a middle aged man who had came to the market to resume his daily buying and selling and whose name was simply given as ‘Biggy’  but oblivious of the fire incident the previous night, collapsed and died upon seeing that his entire wares and whole market had been burnt by the fire.
He was rushed to the nearby hospital but died before he could get the place.
The sad incident happened just about two months after a similar incident took place at the multi billion naira Uwelu Auto Parts Market in Egor Local Governmen Area of the state.
Traders and residents close to Santana Market disclosed that the inferno started at about 9:30pm on Saturday when the market, reputed for hosting the rich and middle class as well as others most of who come from the Government Reservation Area, GRA, and adjoining areas within and outside the capital, had closed for the day.
New Telegraph learnt that the fire started from one of the stores inside the market and spread to others.
The cause of the fire was not readily known but residents said it may have been caused by power surge when the Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) restored light to the market after four days of outage.
