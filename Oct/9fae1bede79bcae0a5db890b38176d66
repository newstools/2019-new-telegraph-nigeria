Arsenal may rekindle their interest in Super Eagles midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi when the transfer window opens next summer. Ndidi’s stock has continued to rise and Leicester City might lose their prized asset if Arsenal make their ambition concrete next July. Ndidi, who had 8.46 whoscored.com rating in the 9-0 thuimping of Southampton on Friday night, has been a mainstay in Brendan Rogers’ team this season totaling 10 appearances for Leicester City scoring two goals in the process. He has been linked with so many clubs but Arsenal are reportedly planning to win the race for the midfielder with £50m bid. The Gunners are also keen to add Granit Xhaka as part of the deal that will bring the former Genk star to the Emirates Stadium.
