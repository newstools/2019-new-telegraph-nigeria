Nigerian Afropop singer, David Adeleke, better known as Davido, has announced a receipt of an endorsement deal from a diaper-producing Nigerian brand, for his unborn child. The award-winning music star took to his Instagram page on Tuesday to share pictures of himself flanked by two men as he shows off a pack of diapers. “I’m super excited my unborn son, OBO Jnr, already getting big bags. Dude coming into the world super-rich, Mario & Juliet Baby Diapers & Wipes,” he captioned the post. After Davido proposed to Chioma Rowland, his fiance, the duo’s families celebrated the union in a blissful introduction ceremony. The 26-year-old singer also claimed that US singer, Chris Brown, has indicated interest to be on his groomsmen train. Although the precise date is yet to be fixed, the ‘Assurance’ crooner told his fans that 2020 is going to be the big year. On September 14, Davido broke the news that his wife-to-be was pregnant. Chioma would later embark on a baby shopping spree but not for their unborn child. Chioma, 24, is reported to have met Davido while studying economics at Babcock University. The singer has, since, had a song put out in her name and has not spared any chance at flaunting her to his fans in social media posts and during concerts.
