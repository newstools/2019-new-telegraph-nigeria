   A 27-year-old woman, Blessing Edet was on Wednesday sentenced to 10 years in prison for stabbing Edet Ebong, her 33-year-old fiancé to death during a fight over her refusal to wear an engagement ring he had given to her. Edet, who was initially charged for murder, was convicted on a commuted sentence of voluntary manslaughter by Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo of an Ikeja Special Offences Court, Lagos. While delivering her judgement, Justice Taiwo said: “By stabbing the deceased in the lower part of his abdomen, she did not intend to cause grievous harm to the defendant. The defendant has established factors necessary to prove self-defence. “I find that the defendant acted in self-defence as she was a victim of unprovoked assault. The defendant is not guilty of murder but I find her guilty of the involuntary manslaughter of Edet Ebong. “Section 227 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State prescribes life imprisonment for the offence of involuntary manslaughter. This is a clear case of recklessness on the part of both the deceased and the defendant. “I hereby sentence the defendant to 10 years imprisonment with no option of fine. The sentence will take effect from the month of August 2015 which is when she has been in custody,” the judge ruled.
