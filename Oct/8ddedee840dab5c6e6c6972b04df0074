Flood accompanying heavy rain in Asaba, Delta State, has swept away a 32-year-old polytechnic graduate, identified as Chinedu Igboke. This came three months after flood killed a 10-year-old daughter of a security guard to a contracting firm, the Tratrix, handling the construction of a road extension to a dual carriageway. The girl’s body was later recovered at the popular Redeemed Junction on Okpanam Road. Yesterday’s victim, Igboke, who hailed from Ebonyi State, was working as security guard in a private school at Shekinah Love Assembly Street, off Ralph Uwechue Way, Okpanam Road, Asaba, fell into the uncovered manhole of the ongoing drainage construction. He was said to be directing traffic as a result of the rain which caused gridlock along the route when he over-stepped the pavement and the flood swept him off his feet. A witness said the victim died doing “corporal work of mercy” on the ever-busy road. “The spot where he fell into had overgrown with weeds. He did not observe it well before placing his legs. It is unfortunate that he died in the course of discharging charity work. When he fell into the gutter, the flood slammed his head against the concrete walls. He immediately lost strength to battle against the tide,” the source said. Frantic effort by authorities of the school where the victim was working as a security guard to recover his body was in vain. Residents said the flood would have taken the body to the popular Anwai River.
