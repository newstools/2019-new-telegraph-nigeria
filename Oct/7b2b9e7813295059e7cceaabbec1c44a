Bi g Brother Naija 2019 ex-housemate, Frodd, granted an interview recently and the comments he made about his relationship with Esther has sent Twitter into a frenzy. During the last edition of Big Brother Naija, two contestants who drew so much attention to viewers were Frodd and Esther because of their interesting relationship. Well, in a recent interview with Wazobia FM, Frodd was asked about his relationship with Esther and gave a very shocking response.   A c – cording to him, he won’t be having time for that relationship, for now, rather he wants to try and make milk out all that he can and make his fans happy. Since the video from that interview made it to the public domain, Twitter has been awash with a lot of people dragging Frodd for making that statement. So guys, here is how Twitter is reacting to Frodd’s latest interview: Chukwuemeka Okoye (Frodd) @ callme_frodd2 “Family, I can never discredit Esther or pretend that we don’t have a unique friendship. What I meant was, we are currently busy trying to put our different homes together while attending all these interviews.  We are amazing and have been in touch.” See some of the reactions below Constance Simon@Constan19487513 says: “FroddNation doesn’t want Esther, she almost ruined your chances of winning, if not for our prayers, fasting and everything. We get insulted, abused on the street…we decided to go with the flow knowing you would realise she is a mistake once you are out. Go with your head.” Frodd’s Akaya @AKHLCEEC: Esther didn’t claim Frodd in her interviews. Frodd isn’t claiming her in his interviews either.  People that are upset just want Frodd to remain a mumu for her, especially her fans. #BBNaija Chigirl @Brenda00114: “Can you stop dragging Esther and her fans to this mess?  How can you write sensible on the first line then end your tweet trolling. This is how dragging from both teams starts put your tweets in order before posting it if you are all about positivity.”
