Onyekachi Eze, ABUJA The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has told Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai that people of Kogi State abhor incitements and threats during election. The All Progressives Congress (APC) appointed el-Rufai as Chairman of its National Campaign Council for the November 16 Kogi State governorship election. PDP in a statement Sunday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said that the people of Kogi State were aware of the “body bag” metaphor. It warned the Kaduna State governor that people of Kogi have a long standing history of tough resistance to forceful occupation and control. “Governor el-Rufai therefore should not bother to lead a failed team of an expansionist force into a lost battle. “He should rather use the opportunity to counsel Governor Yahaya Bello to accept his rejection by the people of Kogi state and be ready to face the burden of a crushing defeat on November 16,” the statement added.
