The All Progressives Congress (APC) has accused the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Bayelsa State of trying to foster panic in the state to prepare the ground for a state government-sponsored violence ahead of the November 16 governorship election. The state’s Publicity Secretary and Secretary, Media and Publicity Committee of APC Bayelsa State 2019 Governorship Campaign Council, Mr. Doifie Buokoribo, said this in a statement on Thursday in Yenagoa in a reaction to allegations of poll rigging and violence by the Bayelsa PDP Chairman, Mr. Moses Cleopas. APC also accused the governor, Hon. Seriake Dickson, and his party of engaging in “a dress rehearsal for their own usual electoral violence and poll robbery.” It described the allegations by PDP as “the ranting of a panic-stricken party rocked by greed and fear of failure owing to its own poor performance, which is struggling to sow anxiety among the people to stave off imminent electoral rejection.”
