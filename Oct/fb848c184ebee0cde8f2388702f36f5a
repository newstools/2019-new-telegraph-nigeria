Vehicle Inspection Officers (VIO) have been charged to refocus their operations by reporting bad road infrastructure in various parts of the country to relevant authorities rather than concentrating on arresting motorists for traffic offences. Speaking during a courtesy visit by members of the National Conference of Directors/Chief VIOs of the Federation, led by Engineer Adebayo Olusoji in Ilorin, the Kwara State Deputy Governor, Mr. Kayode Alabi, stressed the need for VIOs to play more active role in ensuring safety of lives and property on Nigerian roads. While lamenting present state of some major roads in the country, the deputy governor said that people should not heap the blame only on government, calling for complementary roles by members of the public. Alabi, who called on VIO operatives to check overloading, particularly among commercial transporters, lamented that the shabby practice is common on Nigerian roads. Also speaking, the leader of the team, Engineer Olusoji, enumerated functions and duties of VIOs which include ensuring safety of lives and property on Nigerian roads. Engineer Olusoji who is the Head Controlling, Regulations and Enforcement Division, Lagos State Ministry of Transportation said that the office played major role in the issuance of licence and road worthiness certificate. He noted that the Conference would meet in Lagos for a four-day retreat beginning from Wednesday to Saturday.
