A 67-year-old woman, Queen Irene Cole said to be the Godmother and Attorney of the beneficiaries of the massive wealth of renowned late philanthropist, Sir Mobolaji Bank Anthony, has appealed to the Nigerian Police to urgently release her domestic staff who according to her was wrongly arrested by the police for allegedly smoking Indian hemp.  Queen Cole, a retired Naval Officer in the United States (U.S.) and mother of one of the children of the late philanthropist, said three of her domestic staff – Rilwan Akinlabi, Rafiu Akinlabi,Olalekan Samson and Rafiu were arrested by the police who stormed her residence at 29, Okotie Ebo Close, Ikoyi, Lagos, accused the boys of smoking Indian hemp and took them away without finding any of the illegal weed in their possession.  Speaking to journalists at her residence, Cole also raised alarm over threat to her life following a petition she wrote alleging diversion of dividends and seeking protection for the beneficiaries of the Will of Late Bank Anthony.  She said the police entered her private residence and bundled her domestic staff away despite not finding anything incriminating with them. She therefore wondered why the innocent young boys would be arrested and detained for four days. “How many little boys around here smoke that you (Police) will now take them from inside a house and detained them for four days and then take them to Abuja. Why doing such things to those young boys? I see the arrest of my domestic staff as part of the gimmicks of some people to attack me and frustrate me out of this property,” she said.
