N igeria’s total federally-collected revenue dropped by 29.4 per cent to N879.39 billion in August 2019 compared with the monthly budget estimate of N1.2 trillion, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) said in its Economic Report for August, 2019 released yesterday. The CBN also disclosed that the revenue fell below the receipt of N931.93 billion in the preceding month by 5.6 per cent.   According to the apex bank, “The decrease, relative to the monthly budget estimate, was attributed to the shortfall in both oil and non-oil revenue.   “Oil receipts at N484.75 billion or 55.1 per cent of total revenue was below the monthly budget of N798.83 billion by 39.3 per cent. However, it exceeded the receipt of N387.74 billion in the preceding month by 25.0 per cent. The decrease in oil revenue relative to the monthly budget was attributed to shut-ins and shut-downs at some NNPC terminals due to pipeline leakages and maintenance activities.”   Similarly, it disclosed that non-oil receipt at N394.64 billion or 44.9 per cent of total revenue, was below the monthly budget of N447.24 billion and the preceding month’s earning of N544.19 billion by 11.8 per cent and 27.5 per cent, respectively. “The drop in collection, relative to the monthly budget, was due to the decline in revenue from Corporate Tax and Federal Government Independent Revenue,” the CBN said.   In the last few days, financial analysts have been questioning the Federal Government’s ability to realise the N8.155 trillion revenue projection in its 2020 budget. For instance, in its preliminary review of the budget obtained by New Telegraph, the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) faulted the projected revenue, stressing that it was overly ambitious and unrealistic given the trend the national budget had taken in recent years.   The CSJ pointed out that over the years, the Federal Government has continued to propose unrealistic revenue projections, thereby leading to poor implementation of budgets as there were usually no funds to execute projects. It noted that in 2016, revenue projections fell short by 23 per cent; by 47.73 per cent in 2017 and in 2018 by 45 per cent.   Meanwhile, the CBN also revealed in the economic report for August 2019 that Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) borrowed a total of N2,867.77 trillion from it through its Standing Lending Facility (SLF) window during the period. The regulator said: “Commercial banks and the merchant banks continued to access the standing facilities window to square up their positions in August 2019. The trend at the CBN standing facilities window showed more patronage at the Standing Lending Facility (SLF) window, reflecting the liquidity squeeze in the market. Applicable rates for the SLF and Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) remained at 15.50 per cent and 8.50 per cent, respectively.   “The total SLF granted during the review period was N2, 867.77 trillion (inclusive of Intra-day Lending Facility (ILF) converted to overnight repo). Daily average was N179.24 billion in the 16 transaction days in August 1 – 26, 2019. Total interest earned was N1.87 billion. The total SDF granted during the review period was N257.35 billion with a daily average of N16.08 billion in the 16 transaction days. Daily request ranged from N0.15 billion to N34.60 billion. Cost incurred on SDF in the month stood at N0.09 billion,” it added.
