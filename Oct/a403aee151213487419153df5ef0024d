Members of the Ogunlenu, Mafe, Sanwo, Egundebi and Sanusi family of Oriyanrin village in Ibeju-Lekki Local Government Area of Lagos State have cried out to the Lagos State Government, particularly Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to save them from a group of people encroaching on their land. Mr. Mafe Gbayi, who spoke with Saturday Telegraph on the telephone, said: “A group of people from Ogogoro Village in Ibeju-Lekki Local Government Area has been illegally occupying and allocating an expanse of land belonging to our family situated at Oriyanrin village near Okunfolu in Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos, to individuals, families and corporate bodies.” According to Gbayi, all efforts made by the family to stop the land grabbers and their representative from further encroaching on the said land have thus far proved abortive. He added that the land grabbers through their solicitors, sponsors and representatives, had claimed ownership of the landbecause of a purported doctored history of family settlement and ownership of the land. He said: “We, therefore, appeal to the Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to help secure our land and stop this illegality, which is currently causing tension in the community and if not handled well, may snowball into possible crisis,” he said. He said the families believed in the ability of government to do what is right, stressing that they, will continue to toe the line of peace and readily offer support to ensure that every wrong is made right and that justice is served without hindrance on this case. “We also advise all those who allegedly acquired our family land through Ogunyelu family to vacate same as this land, being our sole property, will be fully protected within the ambits of the law,” he said.
