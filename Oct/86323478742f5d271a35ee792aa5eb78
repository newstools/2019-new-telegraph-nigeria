There seems to be no let-up in the feud between Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State and National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Comrade Adams Oshiomhole as the Deputy Governor of the State, Hon Philip Shaibu, Sunday night spent over four hours at the state police command headquarters in Benin waiting to secure the release of the Special Adviser to the governor on Security, Mr. Andrew Momodu. Momodu was initially scheduled to be whisked to Abuja on Monday. The security aide to the governor was arrested at about 9pm on Sunday night by policemen from Abuja. The arrest following an alleged petition that he was one of those that pelted Oshiomhole’s Benin residence with stones. But in reaction, Shaibu vowed that he would rather sleep outside the police headquarters should Momodu not be released to him. Others said to be on the list for arrest by the police for questioning are Special Adviser to Obaseki on Political Matters (Edo South) Hon Osaigbovo Iyoha, Head of Obaseki’s Public Works Volunteers (PUWOV) Mr. Murtari Osagie, Mr. Albert Obazee, Mr. Kelly Okungbowa and Augustine Edosomwan. The operatives from Abuja had after about four hours wait by the Deputy Governor and other aides of the governor, released Momodu on grounds that Shaibu would make them available for questioning in Abuja on Wednesday. Speaking to newsmen shortly after his release, Momodu said he was arrested in a commando style by the policemen as he was going home from his business premises on airport road, harassed and locked up inside a cell.
