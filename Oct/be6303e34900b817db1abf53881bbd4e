Muritala Ayinla Concerned by the impact of continued heavy downpour on weak structures, the Lagos State Government Sunday warned owners and developers of over 200 identified distressed buildings across the state to act as directed or lose the properties completely. The General Manager of the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA), Abiola Kosegbe, an engineer, who gave the warning, said that the details of some of the identified distressed buildings which the Agency had hitherto captured will soon be published in national newspapers. Hence, she appealed to occupants of the identified distressed buildings to vacate the endangered premises in order to save lives and properties. She noted with disdain how several buildings had collapsed in recent times due to inadequate foundation design and use of substandard building materials, adding that the present administration of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu will leave no stone unturned in his bid to achieve zero-tolerance to building collapses in the state. The LASBCA boss called for the need for the public to build right by ensuring that soil investigation is carried out on all sites before commencing construction . This will ensure that the engineers design the right foundation which is the bedrock of all buildings. According to her, only the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA) has the mandate to identify and remove any distressed building and enjoined owners to provide a complete structural stability report within the statutory time limit given.
