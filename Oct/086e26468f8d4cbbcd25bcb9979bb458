Former Governor of Kano State and the immediate past senator representing Kano Central, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, escaped been killed in Kano as armed thugs attacked him. The Kwankwasiyya (a group of Kwankwaso’s supporters) spokesperson, Hajiya Binta Sipikin, alleged that the thugs members of the All progressives Congress (APC). They reportedly laid an ambush for Kwankwaso at the Madobi Road underpass. The attack occurred during the former governor’s visit to his hometown, Madobi, where he opened a midwifery school. Sipikin said eight persons were critically injured while several cars were damaged. She said: “This attack was pre-planned because we were told that heavily armed thugs were kept under the bridge to attack us as we were coming from Madobi. “We believed (Governor Abdullahi) Ganduje was behind this attack because we heard one of his aides’ name being mentioned as we were being attacked.” Sipikin said the injured Kwankwasiyya members were currently receiving medical attention in various hospitals. However, one of the governor’s top aides, who did not want to be mentioned, denied the allegation levelled against Ganduje. He said the attack was an internal wrangling between the Kwankwasiyya members who were fed up with their principal. The aide regretted that whenever such attack occurred, the Kwankwasiyya members were always quick to link it to Ganduje. He said it was a public knowledge that there was internal wrangling within the Kwankwasiyya group.
