 S uper Eagles goalkeeper Ikechukwu Ezenwa has re-joined the home based team preparing for the return leg against their Togolese counterparts billed for Agege Stadium, Lagos on Saturday.   Nigeria’s U-23 coach, Imama Amapakabo has invited the Heartland of Owerri goalkeeper for the return leg having suffered a 4-1 defeat in the first leg in Lome in his bid to overturn the deficit in the 2020 Championship of African Nations qualifiers.   Aside from Ezenwa, Katsina United youngster, Destiny Ashadi, and Kano Pillars striker, Nyima Nwagua, are also new additions to the roster to battle Togo in Lagos.  Ashadi, who has been the creative force behind Katsina’s success since they gained promotion to the Nigeria elite league four years ago, is expected to join the rest of the squad in Abuja along with Ifeanyi Aneamena (Enyimba), Anthony Shimaga (Rangers) and Ifeanyi Nweke (Kano Pillars).   The team now have a huge mountain to climb as they must score at least three unreplied goals past Togo to qualify for the championship slated for Cameroon next June.   It will be a fresh opportunity for Ezenwa to play himself back into main national team reckoning, as Eagles Manager, Gernot Rohr, said one of the reasons why the former FC Ifeanyiubah shot-stopper was not used in Sunday’s friendly against Brazil is because he lacks competitive game time in recent months.  Ezenwa, who is number two in the pecking order of Nigeria’s goalkeepers, has not tasted action since the conclusion of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.
