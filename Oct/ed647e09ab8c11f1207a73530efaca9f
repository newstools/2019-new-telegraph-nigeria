Samuel Chukwueze, has gained superlative words of praise from his Villarreal teammate, Santi Cazorla, with the former Arsenal star declaring he is impressed by the ability of the youngster on the ball. Spanish Cazorla was beaming with delight following the top notch display of the AFCON 2019 sensation in the last round of matches in LA Liga where he spearheaded the 5-1 demolition of Real Betis which invariably handed him the man-of-the match award. The Chile 2015 FIFA U-17 World Cup winner’s super-sub performance for The Yellow Submarines was good enough to see him get in contention for the team of the week award which would be released today. Cazorla submitted: “We have to wait for our chance to strike and we took the chances when they came. Chukwueze played a role after his introduction. He’s magical with the ball at his feet, the plan is for him to continue progressing for the good of the team.” Villarreal had a slim 1-0 lead at the break but the Balompe side responded with the leveler three minutes into the second half but the introduction of the dazzling 20-year-old winger changed the complexity of the tie at the Estadio de la Ceramica. Chukwueze was introduced in the 57th minute and he made an immediate impact for Javier Calleja’s side as veteran Cazorla gained from his effort when he scored from the penalty spot to make it 2-1 after the Eagles’ rookie winger was fouled in the box on 67 minutes. The Nigerian closed the scorer’s sheet with an injury-time goal after strikes by Karl Yoko Ekambi and Gerard Moreno has sealed the game for the hosts.
