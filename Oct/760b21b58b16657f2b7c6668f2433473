Researchers from Japan have found that men who eat mushrooms could reduce their risk of developing prostate cancer. According to the findings of the new study published in the ‘International Journal of Cancer,’ fungus was particularly beneficial for people that are over 50 who eat lots of meat and dairy, but little fruit and vegetables. The study however suggested those who ate mushrooms once or twice a week had an eight per cent lower risk of developing the disease, compared with those who ate them less than once a week. Similarly, the research showed that those who ate mushrooms three or more times per week had a 17 per cent lower risk. Although, edible mushrooms are consumed for their nutritional value and for their culinary value, the new study shows that consuming mushrooms could prevent prostate cancer. Study lead author Assistant Professor Shu Zhang said: “Test-tube studies and studies conducted on living organisms have shown that mushrooms have the potential to prevent prostate cancer.” However, the relationship between mushroom consumption and incident prostate cancer in humans has never been investigated before,” Zhang added. Prostate cancer is cancer that occurs in the prostate — a small walnutshaped gland in men that produces the seminal fluid that nourishes and transports sperm. Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in men. While 1.2 million new prostate cases were diagnosed worldwide in 2018, current data from the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimated that more than 140,000 new cancer cases including prostate cancer occur in Nigeria every year. The researchers explained that prostate cancer begins when cells in the prostate gland – a small walnut-shaped gland found only in men, which produces the fluid that forms part of the semen – start to grow out of control.
