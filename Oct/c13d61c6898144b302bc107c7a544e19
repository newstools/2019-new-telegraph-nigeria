The Super Eagles have been handed multiple injury boost ahead of the double header Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Benin and Lesotho in November.  Four key players of the team, Kenneth Omeruo, Ola Aina, Samuel Kalu and  Oghenekaro Etebo  were forced to pull out of the last friendly game against Brazil due to injury but they have all returned to action with their various clubs in Europe.  Leganes  of Spain defender, Omeruo, pulled out of the friendly game after picking up an injury before his club’s home game against Levante on October 5.  The former Chelsea star however played the full 90 minutes in his club’s 2-0 loss against Getafe at the weekend getting a yellow card in the game.  Torino defender, Ola Aina, also missed the game in Singapore with a domestic accident but returned to the bench against Williams Troost-Ekong’s Udinese, although he was on the bench for the duration of the game.  Bordeaux winger Kalu played his ninth appearance in the French Ligue 1 this season after he was selected by manager Paulo Sousa in the club’s 1-0 home loss against Saint-Etienne on Sunday. He played 55 minutes before he was substituted for Hwang Ui-Jo.  Former Warri Wolves midfielder, Etebo was a late withdrawal from the Nigeria squad for this month’s friendly, he however played the entirety of Stoke City’s 2-0 win against Fulham.  Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, will be happy with the return of the players as he continue to strategise ahead of the qualifiers.
