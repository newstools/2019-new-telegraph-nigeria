Sola Adeyemo, Ibadan Sequel to the arrest of six workers at the Distance Learning Center (DLC) of the University of Ibadan, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) of the university Tuesday said no academic staff was involved in examination malpractices leading to the arrest. Six  DLC staff of the Institution were picked up by the operatives of the Department of State Service (DSS) last Friday for alleged involvement in aiding and abeting examination malpractices and compromising the integrity of examinations.
The UI ASUU Chairman, Prof. Deji Omole, while reacting to some  newspaper reports which claimed members of the union were part of those arrested for being involved in examination malpractices, said those arrested by the DSS were non-academic (NASU) staff in the technical unit of the DLC.
Omole criticized the Director of Public Communications of the institution, Olatunji Oladejo,  who the  papers attributed the story to, as  misinforming the public. He  explained that no member of the academic staff has been fingered or linked to the fraud, adding that they  should not be dragged into the mess.
