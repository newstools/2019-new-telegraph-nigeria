A Federal High Court sitting in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital, has ordered Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki (AE-FUTHA) to pay Mrs.  Ifeyinwa Awada, who was a patient to the hospital, the sum of N50,200,000.
The court, presided over by Justice Akintayo Aluko, awarded the cost against
AE-FUTHA over medical negligence.
Mrs.  Ifeyinwa Awada and her father, Nwugo Chimere Nwugo, who are 1st
and 2nd  plaintiffs respectively had dragged the hospital and its management to court seeking justice  over death of the 1st plaintiff’s baby  in her womb  following  alleged medical negligence of the
hospital.
The suit has the hospital, its Board of Management, a Consultant
Gynaecologist, and the Chief Medical Director of the hospital as defendants.
While N50 million was for the damages, the sum of N200,000 was the cost of litigations borne by the plaintiffs.
The 1st plaintiff had  alleged  that the hospital acted negligently in attending to her while she was in labour; and that, according to her, resulted to the death of her baby in her womb.
