The Yoruba Council of Youths Worldwide, an apex youth umbrella organisation in the Southwest, on Monday passed a vote of confidence on the Vice President Osinbajo over his call on the need for self-regulation in the individual use of social media, describing the move as crucial in promoting mutual peace and dousing any tension in the country. The group, which also specifically commended the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration for its commitment at improving the welfare of Nigerians and tackling national challenges, said Osinbajo’s call for self-regulation in the individual use of social media, while downplaying any attempt of government regulation during an inter-faith leaders conference at the Shehu Musa Yar’Adua Centre in Abuja recently, was good move to sustain peace in the country. The Council, in a statement signed by its President, Aremo Oladotun Hassan, a lawyer, however, pledged its  continued support to the Buhari/Osinbajo-led administration, especially with its commitment towards improving the nation’s economy and addressing the country’s security challenges. Expressing confidence in the administration  to tackle security and other challenges, the council said the successful meeting President Buhari held with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, was a clear indication of the federal government’s commitment to improving the welfare of its citizens through enhanced security and the economy. Hassan pledged the council’s continued support to the Buhari/Osinbajo-led administration, especially with its commitment towards improving the nation’s economy and addressing the country’s security challenges. “As President Buhari noted in Sochi, Russia, while speaking to a gathering of Nigerian students and professionals, we believe that his government is truly committed to protecting Nigerians at home and abroad,” he said.
