P resident Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday accused State governors of frustrating the execution of Federal Government projects through withholding of lands. The President in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on media and publicity, Garba Shehu, warned that henceforth, the Federal Government might be forced to re-allocate projects elsewhere if any state government or communities create unnecessary impediments in the allocation of land or access to such lands for federal projects. According to Garba, Buhari in a recent directive to Ministers requested them to have the states clear all lingering land issues threatening federal projects under their supervision or have such projects moved to willing states where that becomes impossible. He said: “The idea of chasing away contractors on site or making undue demands from them by local communities or the deliberate actions of state governments to frustrate the allocation of lands for federal projects is an antithesis of the people’s welfare,” the President warned. President Buhari regretted that some communities in the states are frustrating the siting of federal projects in their areas by making impossible demands for land compensation on contractors and even chasing them away from site where they are unable to meet up. To compound matters, contractors kept away from site often make further demands on payment whenever they return to site. Buhari also noted that the refusal to allocate lands for federal projects or the growing hostility  by communities against contractors on site are hurting the interests of the very people governments are elected to serve. “By denying federal government lands for projects and creating unnecessary obstacles for the execution of these projects, it may be unfair to turn around and accuse the same federal government of marginalising people in terms of projects allocation.” “When it comes to the welfare of the people, governments at all levels should be united by the common goal of improving the well-being of the people, regardless of political affiliation,” the President stressed.
