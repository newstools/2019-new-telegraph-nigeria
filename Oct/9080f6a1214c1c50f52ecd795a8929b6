 Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo (Mrs) of an Ikeja Special Offences Court, Lagos Tuesday sentenced a travel agent, Oluseyi Momoh Lamoriu, to seven years in prison for forgery.   Lamoriu was charged by the economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and convicted on an eight count charge bothering on forgery and possession of fraudulent documents.   Justice Dada, while pronouncing judgement, said that the defendant, who appears not to be a first time offender since being convicted by Justice Mojisola Dada of same jurisdiction, seems not to have learnt his lessons.   “The defendant was convicted on similar charges before Justice Dada on a plea bargain agreement. It is evident that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt against the defendant. “I hereby sentence the defendant to seven years in prison without an option of fine,” the judge ruled.   According to the EFCC prosecutor, Ofoma Franklin, the Lamoriu committed the offences on August 22, 2017 in Lagos.
