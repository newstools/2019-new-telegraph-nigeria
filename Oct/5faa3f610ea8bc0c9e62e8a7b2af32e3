*Ogun PDP leaders visit gov, blast Amosun Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, on Tuesday, met with a former governor, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, and the governorship candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) in the 2019 election, Prince Gboyega Isiaka.  The meeting held separately behind closed doors at the Governor’s Office, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta. Similarly, Abiodun also held a secret meeting with some leaders of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), led by the state Chairman, Chief Adebayo Dayo.  New Telegraph reports that it was the first time since leaving office in 2011 that Daniel would visit the governor’s office. Meanwhile, the PDP has expressed optimism that Abiodun would perform well as the state’s helmsman.  Speaking after meeting the governor, the party chairman lauded him for accommodating opposition members “unlike the immediate past governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun.”  Dayo was accompanied by Otunba Robert Adenaike, Chief Kola Sorinola and Dr Remi Bakare, who was the Director-General of Senator Buruji Kashamu’s 2019 governorship campaign under PDP.
