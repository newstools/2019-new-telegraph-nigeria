The Association of Lagos Titled Chiefs yesterday warned President Muhammadu Buhari against sidelining his deputy, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, saying that the president must be conscious of actions capable of creating negative impression of his administration. The association, which is a non-political association of honorary chiefs and prominent members of the Lagos community, who had served the state and the nation meritoriously, also lauded Osinbajo’s integrity, steadfastness and veracity. In a statement signed by its General-Secretary, Engr. Olawumi Gasper, the association urged President Buhari to ensure that any future creation or appointment would not give an impression that his deputy was being sidelined. It said: “The creation of the new Economic Body, Economic Advisory Council (New Body) by His Excellency, the President does not appear to clash with or in any manner disturb the workings of the Council of which Osinbajo is the Chairman. “The association warned that President Muhammadu Buhari should graciously ensure that any future creation or appointment did not in any way give the impression that his deputy was being sidelined, adding that the Vice President could easily have been made the Chairman of the new body so that the scope of his duties on the Council would seem enhanced and enlarged and that the Vice –President could also benefit from the experts the President appointed on the new body.” Meanwhile, the association maintained that having re-examined the recent issues in the polity, it re-affirmed its total support for the Vice-President for his integrity, steadfastness and veracity as it had reviewed the allegations against Vice-President Osinbajo and found all the allegations as baseless and unfounded.
