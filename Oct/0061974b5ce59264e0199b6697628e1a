Chief of Army Staff, General Tukur Buratai, on Thursday said the next military operation, ‘Atilogwu Udo 1’, which is scheduled to kick off on Friday, in the South East geo-political zone and which replaces ‘Operation Python Dance 3’, was not targeted at any group or individual in the region. Buratai stated this in Enugu at a two-day Civil-Media-Military Relations Summit organised for journalists, traditional rulers and other stakeholders in the zone with the theme ‘Galvanising citizens support for Military operations in Nigeria through the Media’ which held at 82 Division of the Nigerian Army. Proscribed separatist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) had recently claimed the exercise, which replaces the Exercise Egwu Eke’ was targeted at its members. Egwu Eke (Python Dance) which held for three editions in the past witnessed clashes between the Army and IPOB members. In the 2017 edition, the military invaded the Umuahia hometown of the group’s leader, Nnamdi Kanu. IPOB claimed many persons were killed in that invasion, an allegation the military continues to deny. Kanu and his parents disappeared after attack and were not seen for some time. Kanu later surfaced in 2018 in Europe. He recently announced the death of his mother in a Germany hospital, blaming her death on the injuries and trauma she received during the invasion. The whereabouts of his father still remains unknown till date.
