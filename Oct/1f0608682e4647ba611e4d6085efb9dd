T he Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Benue State yesterday admonished security operatives in the state to apprehend the President, Middle Belt Vanguard for Democracy and Good Governance, Chief Justus Obekpa, for making remarks it described as ‘defamatory’ against Governor Samuel Ortom, former Senate President, David Mark and the party. The party was reacting to a statement credited to Obekpa, who alleged that the former Senate President, David Mark and Governor Samuel Ortom were allegedly manipulating the judiciary to deliver judgement in favour of PDP candidates at the various election petitions’ tribunals. Chairman of PDP in the state, Sir John Ngbede, in a swift reaction, described the allegation as “an attempt to diminish the trust and confidence the public have in the judiciary.” He said the statement was borne out of malice and was an attempt to create mischief and disaffection targeted towards the PDP family in Benue State. “Our candidates and the party have defended and are still defending their God-given mandate legally at the appellate court after all the petitions were heard and determined by the respective election petition panels.” According to him, “As a party, speaking from an informed position; election petition are sui generis (of a special class). Unlike other normal civil cases; one must plead and prove the allegation of irregularities enumerated in the petition . and the infractions with the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended). The failure to prove same would amount to a dismissal of the petition,” Ngbede said.
