F ormer Minister of Petroleum, Ibe Kachikwu, may have come to terms with reality of life that says success has many children and failure is an orphan. As the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources with unfettered access to NNPC and its vast resources, Kachikwu was the beautiful bride whose attention was coveted by those who found him useful. They flattered him from midnight to high noon, professing undying vows of friendship. They milked their association for all it was worth, smiling to the bank with big bucks raked in from reflected reputation. At one time there were hopes that the former president of the Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) had done enough to impress the President and would make the shortlist of returnee ministers. Alas, it was not to be. His friends in name only, having already packed their bags in anticipation of such an eventuality, didnâ€™t even say goodbye before zooming out of his life at high speed. Now, the once cynosure of all eyes has become like a beautiful flower wasting its sweetness on the desert air.
