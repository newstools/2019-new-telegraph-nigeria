*Says Amosun’s neglect of roads shocking Kunle Olayeni, Abeokuta Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has said his administration will regenerate the six local government areas in Egbaland and address haphazard infrastructural development done by his predecessor. Abiodun, who spoke at the Ogun Central senatorial district town hall meeting held in Abeokuta on Friday, declared that he was committed to working with Egba leaders and stakeholders towards achieving “the state of our collective dreams.” He lamented the alleged neglect of township and rural roads under the immediate past administration of Senator Ibikunle Amosun, saying his own government will rescue residents agonizing over deplorable state of roads. Dignitaries at the event include the Alake and Paramount Ruler of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo; Osile of Oke Ona Egba, Oba Adedapo Tejuoso; Agura of Gbagura, Oba Babajide Bakre; state chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Yemi Sanusi, as well as representatives of market associations, professional bodies, civil society organisations and student unions. “We are regenerating Ogun Central (comprising six local government areas). This is the capital of the state. We are regenerating the area, but not by way of flyovers,” the governor stated apparently lashing out at his predecessor’s urban renewal programme. “We are creating a purposeful urban regeneration, not just haphazard regeneration. We are on top of infrastructural development,” he added. Abiodun, however, said he would not witch hunt anybody in discharging his duties and delivering good governance.
