The Director of Public Relations and Indormation,  Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, who made the disclosure in a statement Tuesday, said the appointment was approved by the Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar.  “The Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, has approved the promotion of Master Warrant Officer (MWO) Grace Tabawa Garba to the exalted rank of Air Warrant Officer (AWO). “With the promotion, MWO Garba becomes the first female Senior Non-Commissioned Officer (SNCO) to be promoted to the highest rank in the Non-Commissioned Officers’ cadre in the Armed Forces of Nigeria. The SNCO, who has put in not less than 33 years of outstanding meritorious service to the Nation, was found worthy to be promoted to the rank of AWO  for her exemplary leadership qualities, hard work as well as her contributions to the Service over the years. “The promotion demonstrates the commitment of the current NAF leadership in paying adequate attention to the empowerment of female personnel to  realize their full potentials,” Daramola said.
