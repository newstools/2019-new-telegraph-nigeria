Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom on Friday offered scholarships to nine-year-old twins, Wandoo Uii and Ngodoo Uii, who were born by Mrs. Ngufan Uii while she was being treated of snake bite at Bishop Murray Hospital, Makurdi. The victim, who was sponsored by the governor under his business conglomerate, the Oracle Business Foundation Limited (OBFL), had parted ways with her husband, Mr. Uii Iorver before the incident reunited them again. The governor stated that the circumstances surrounding the birth of the twins were only possible with God’s intervention, stressing that they deserved quality education to be great in future. He stated that he was moved to initiate the foundation for the treatment of snake bites in year 2000 when he came across a young man who was bitten by a viper and his parents could not afford the cost of treatment and had to be taken back home to die. The governor maintained that when he retired back home and meditated over the incident, he discovered he could have been of help but could not trace the young man’s whereabouts again because he had already been taken back home. He lamented the high cost of treating snake bites which he said sometimes cost over a million naira, stressing that the cost is often unaffordable for the victims who are predominantly peasant farmers.
