A Lagos High Court sitting in Ikeja Wednesday ordered the Lagos State House of Assembly to maintain the status quo in the ongoing probe of procurement of 820 buses by the administration of former Governor of the state, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode. Justice Yetunde Adesanya gave the order while ruling on an exparte motion filed by Ambode through his counsel, Tayo Oyetibo (SAN). The court had on Tuesday ordered Oyetibo to put the respondents on notice before hearing the exparte application. The respondents  are the Speaker, Mudashiru Obasa, House Clerk, Mr A.A Sanni; Chairman of the Ad hoc Committee set up by the House to probe the procurement, Fatai Mojeed and members of the Committee. They are Gbolahan Yishawu, A.A Yusuff, Yinka Ogundimu, Mojisola Lasbat Meranda, M.L Makinde, Kehinde Joseph, T.A Adewale and O.S Afinni. In his statement of claim before the court, Ambode averted that contrary to deliberate misrepresentation of facts by the lawmakers, the procurement of the 820 buses was well captured in the 20 18 Appropriation Law which was duly approved by the House. He added that having prescribed the manner of withdrawal of funds in sections 3 and 4 of the 2018 Appropriation Law, it was unconstitutional for the House to attach another condition in section 9 of the law for further approval to be sought before incurring any expenditure on the purchase of the buses. Highlighting the specific breach of his constitutional rights to fair hearing by the House, the former Governor said on August 27, 2019 during proceedings of the Assembly, some lawmakers thoroughly vilified  and disparaged him as having purchased the buses without budgetary approval and that the procurement was a waste of public funds, while at the end of the proceedings, the House resolved to constitute an Ad Hoc Committee to probe the procurement .
