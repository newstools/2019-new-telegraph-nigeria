Lagos State government has discovered five trucks bearing containers with suspected rotten edible items in Apapa area. Government said it had begun investigation on the items in the containers belonging to Sifax, off Dock Nigeria Limited to ascertain the extent of the damage and confirm the safety of the items for consumption of the residents. About 13 houses are located on the street where the containers are found, leaving huge impact on four houses. Some of the houses affected are Numbers 2, 4, 6 and 8, Trinity Close, Apapa. The discovery of the suspected rotten frozen items followed a series of complaints by the residents to the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LASEPA) and other relevant agencies on the presence of the containers. It was learnt that out of the 25 containers found in the area, five contain rotten frozen food with foul odour which the residents said was endangering their health. Following a barrage of complaints from the residents, a joint action team comprising the General Manager of LASEPA, Dr. Fashawe, and his counterpart in the Lagos Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) conducted an on-the-spot inspection of the containers to confirm the reports of air pollution and release of toxic gas into the environment. Ufordi LASEMA said: “The joint-team discovered edibles including fish which had become rotten due to faulty refrigerators. “The DG/CEO LASEMA observed the absence of emergency action preparedness plan and appropriate safety measures in place to curtail such incidence and guard against re-occurrence. “A total number of 25 containers were located. Five containers laden with edibles have faulty refrigerators. The edibles have therefore defrosted and have become rotten causing severe health hazard to the environment.”
