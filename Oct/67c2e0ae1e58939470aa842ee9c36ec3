Casualties are increasing as Turkey presses on with its cross-border offensive on Kurdish-held areas of northern Syria. At least 11 civilians have died and dozens of fighters from the Kurdish-led SDF and pro-Turkish factions have been killed, reports say. The first death of a Turkish soldier was confirmed by Turkey’s military, reports the BBC. Tens of thousands of people have fled homes in the area, as international calls to halt the attack increase. Republicans in the US House of Representatives have announced plans to introduce a sanctions bill against Turkey, and President Donald Trump has offered to mediate. Turkey moved into northern Syria on Wednesday after the president pulled US troops out of the area. Critics say the US withdrawal effectively gave Turkey the green light to begin its cross-border assault. Turkey has defended the offensive as a bid to create a “safe zone” free of Kurdish militias which could also house Syrian refugees. Turkey regards the Kurdish militias of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) – which have controlled the cross-border areas – as “terrorists” who support an anti-Turkish insurgency. The SDF have been key allies of the United States in the battle against the Islamic State (IS) group. One major concern for the international community is the fate of thousands of suspected IS prisoners, including many foreign nationals, being guarded by Kurdish-led forces in the region. On Thursday, Turkish troops encircled the border towns of Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad. The Kurdish Red Crescent said there had been 11 confirmed civilian deaths so far and 28 serious injuries, mostly in Ras al-Ain and another border town, Qamishli. Some are children.
