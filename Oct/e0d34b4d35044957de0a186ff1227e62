By Daniel Atori, Minna Despite playing a vital role in the screening of the state’s cabinet, members of the Niger State House of Assembly have vowed not to attend any event or occasion in the Government House after being denied access to the Government House during the swearing ceremony of the new commissioners. 
It was reliably learnt that the legislators were on Wednesday prevented from entering into Government House to witness the swearing in ceremony. 
Findings by our Correspondent on Thursday showed that, the legislators, who arrived at the gate of the Government House in a Coster bus were told they would not be allowed into the House because they arrived late. 
The members subsequently vowed equivocally that all through their stay in the Assembly, they will not enter into the Government House. 
The member representing Wushishi Constituency, Honorable Mohammed Bashir Lokogoma, who expressed his grievances to journalists, said: “It is an embarrasment for the state and to us, the members for them to have denied us entry into the Government house when other people who had no business there were allowed in.”
Lokogoma, who is the oldest serving member of the House of Assembly, declared that the governor and his protocol officers belittled the office of the legislators.
