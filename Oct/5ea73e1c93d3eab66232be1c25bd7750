Osimhen reportedly cost Lille 12 million Euros when he switched in the summer from Belgian club Sporting Charleroi. A total of eight goals in all competitions including the UEFA Champions League could now see the striker make a big money move soon. “The club (Lille) are already rubbing their hands because if he continues like this, the clubs will stand in line for him at the end of the season,” French football expert Sirik Geffray told Sporza. “You know how English clubs are, for example. Then his price of 12 million Euros could be three or four times.” He added: “He is the sensation of the moment . “A striker who has not yet turned 21 and who did not have to struggle when he made the switch from Belgium to France, where he was expected to first learn the ropes. “The talk now is that he is already ready for a step higher because he is already a finished article.” Leading Spanish sports newspaper AS have already reported that Osimhen tops FC Barcelona shopping list as a replacement for Luis Saurez.
