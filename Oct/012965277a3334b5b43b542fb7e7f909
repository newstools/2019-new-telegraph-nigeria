Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed, has cried out that about 41, 000 out of 101, 000 civil servants in the state were ghost workers. The governor raised the alarm yesterday when he hosted the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Minister’s Press Corps in Bauchi. Bala, who lamented the financial loss suffered by the state during the immediate past administration as a result of the ghost workers, said he had decided to fight the menace and return the state to probity and accountability. According to him, many of the affected workers have refused to get the mandatory Banking Verification Number (BVN) but were allowed to be collecting salaries by the previous administration. He added that he has immediately suspended such fraudulent transactions and have warned the banks to stop collaborating  with ghost workers to flout Federal Government’s rules. He said; “41,000 out of 101, 000 civil servants in Bauchi State do not have BVN and they have been collecting salaries under the last administration. A lot of compromise! Those who have BVN have getting alerts but the rest of the civil servants must be investigated. “It is good to note that government has not employed any graduate in the last four years. Yet, our salaries were increasing. And some mischievous people are complaining about my discoveries. “We suspect some of the ghost workers are conniving with our education secretaries in the local governments and health directors. As a civil servant, I am not interrogating them; I am just suspecting them to find out what happened. And if I find out that they are not compromising, I will be just and equitable to them. If otherwise, the civil service rules will apply to them, so that nobody will do it again.” He declared.
