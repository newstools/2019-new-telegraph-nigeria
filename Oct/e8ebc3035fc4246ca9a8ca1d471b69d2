L ightning at the weekend reportedly killed a man, Kelechi Nwigbo, from Akahufu Ekpaomaka in Ikwo Local Government of Ebonyi State in his hotel room.  The incident occurred at Mark Doris Hotel at Eke Market, Afikpo in Afipko North Local Government Area.  Nwigbo, who was based in Germany, had checked into the hotel with an instruction that nobody should disturb him, but after four days, the hotel management started perceiving offensive odour from his room and immediately alerted police in Afikpo.  When police broke into the room, the man was seen carrying calabash with some money inside and with white cloth material on his head and waist.  Workers in the hotel told our correspondent that the hotel management heard the thunder strike from his window but because the guest had instructed that nobody should come to his room unless he called the hotel attention, they didn’t border going to check on him.  It was learnt that the last time he came to Nigeria was in 2017 and that the family was not aware of his presence in the country let alone being in Afikpo.  It was also learnt that when the family contacted his friends in Germany, they expressed shock that they were not aware of his journey to Nigeria let alone lodging in Afikpo instead of Abakaliki the capital of Ebonyi State. Sources close to the deceased said the family had gone to a seer to find out the course of Nwigbo’s death.  The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Odah Loveth, confirmed the report and said police were working tirelessly to unravel the cause of the man’s death.  Odah said when the police divisional crime officer, Afikpo Division led his team to the hotel and broke into the room, the man was already decomposing. The PPRO added that the man’s international passport was recovered in the room while his body was evacuated to the mortuary.   Odah appealed to the people of Afikpo, Ikwo and his family members to contact the police if they had any information about the cause of his death.
