Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom Thursday told cattle owners in the state to ensure that their animals are properly ranched to avoid open grazing or be ready to face sanctions as stipulated by law. The governor gave the warning when he sighted a herd of cattle roaming the streets at Iniongun Road in Wadata area of Makurdi. He directed livestock guards to immediately impound the animals and take them to the quarantine unit, stressing that by provisions of the ranching law, the cattle would be auctioned if the owner fails to pay the requisite fines after seven days. “By the provisions of our law, no person has the right to do open grazing, and after seven days if the owner does not come to claim the cows, we are going to auction them and they will pay the fine. “There is no going back, the law is still in force and nothing will stop us from enforcing it,” he said. Governor Ortom said the law does not accord preferences to any individual or group, whether or not they are indigenes of the state.
