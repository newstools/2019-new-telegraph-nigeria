    The Gamai Unity and Development Organisation (GUDO) in Plateau State has raise an alarm on the attempt to short change Justice Monica Mensem Dongban as the President of the Court of Appeal. The group, in a press statement signed the Secretary General Mr Fidelis Damsuk Bitkop and issued to journalists in Jos on Wednesday, said the controversy trailing the recent invitation of their illustrious daughter Justice Monica Bolnaan Mensem-Dongban and Justice of the Court of Appeal by the National Judicial Council (NJC) for interview to the Supreme Court is suspicious. According to the Gamai tribe, which is also the clan of Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State, said they have received the news with mixed feelings and reservations in view of the glaring ulterior motives behind the exercise. “We are also appealing to President Muhammadu Buhari, the National Assembly, all men and women of good conscience, those on the Bench and at the Bar, political leaders, Civil Society and other stakeholders to lend their voice against this dangerous precedence and act of impunity that is capable of derailing the most cherished sanctity of the judiciary in the dispensation of justice in the country. “We are passionately appealing to the National Judicial Council to shelve the planned interview of Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem and if done, toe the path of honour and sanity, by adhering strictly to the established rule of succession at the Court of Appeal through confirming Justice Monica Dongbam as the next President of the Court of Appeal as Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa retires at the end of the year,” the group argued.
