Gunmen have again killed another Nigerian, Mr. Chikamso Ufordi, in South Africa and injure two others. The National Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the Nigerian Union in South Africa, Mr. Odefa Ikele, made the disclosure yesterday in Lagos. Ikele, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), said Ufordi hailed from Awgu Local Government Area of Enugu State. The PRO said Ufordi was killed while two others were injured about 7p.m. on Saturday in Nigel. Nigel is a small gold mining town in Gauteng Province, East Rand near Johannesburg. He said: “One of the witnesses informed us that the deceased, Mr. Chikamso Ufordi, from Awgu Local Government Area of Enugu State, was trailed by some gunmen, and was shot point blank while in his car with two other Nigerian friends. “His friends also sustained injuries, but the late Chikamso died immediately before help could arrive from the province’s Emergency Medical Services (EMS) team. “The injured were rushed to the nearest hospital. A case of murder and attempted murder have already been opened at Nigel Police Cluster.” Three Nigerians were among other foreign nationals who were killed on October 22, during fresh xenophobic attacks on foreigners in different locations of Witbank, Mpumanlaga Province, South Africa. The October 22 attacks came on the heels of efforts by President Muhammadu Buhari and his South African counterpart, Cyril Ramaphosa, to ensure they found amicable and lasting solution to the xenophobia in the latter’s country. Such peace efforts saw Buhari visiting Ramaphosa and holding a town hall meeting with the Nigerian community. They were reported to have been killed by groups made up of community members and taxi drivers who went to different areas in Witbank attacking foreign-owned businesses and foreigners.
