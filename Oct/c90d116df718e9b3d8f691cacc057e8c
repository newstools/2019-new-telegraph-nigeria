 Daniel Atori, Minna  Tragedy was averted on Wednesday after a fuel-laden tanker fell and spilled its content close to the Niger State College of Education, Minna. However, the swift response by the Niger State Fire Service, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Niger state Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA) and personnel from other security agencies to the scene few minutes after the incident occurred, helped to douse the panic. The incident, which happened at about 9:05am, caused gridlock on the expressway as well as adjourning roads. FRSC officials advised motorists plying the Minna-Paikoro Road from the city gate to do so with caution because of the volatile nature of the fuel. The fuel tanker, according to an eyewitness account, tumbled because of the deplorable state of the road, sending its contents gushing out. The eyewitness, Adamu Alheri, who is a taxi driver, told our Correspondent that: “The tanker driver had tried to follow the one-way lane in order to avoid the huge potholes but was unsuccessful as the heavily loaded tank fell to the ground and the petrol contents started gushing out onto the road.” Another witness, a Journalist with the campus radio station, Ultimate FM, Emmanuel Adams told our Correspondent that “the driver was struggling with his steering in order to avoid the bad side of the road. “We thank God that the fire service and security personnel responded immediately. They took over control of vehicular traffic along the road. “If not, a lot of people would have started coming close to see how they can scoop fuel from the tanker. I commend the effort of the police in controlling the traffic.”
