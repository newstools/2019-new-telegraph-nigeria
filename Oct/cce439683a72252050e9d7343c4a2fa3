The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has advised President Muhammadu Buhari not make Nigeria a pariah state by conjuring false statistics to cover its incompetence and failures in governance.
The party in a statement on Thursday by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, expressed shock that President Buhari is discrediting the statistics of development partners.
According to the party, the president’s resort to cook-up statistics and falsification of performance indices would worsen the national challenge and return Nigeria to a pariah state.
PDP described as embarrassing, Buhari’s directive to newly constituted Presidential Economic Advisory Council as well as the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs not to work with statistics from independent agencies, but to rely only on self-sourced data.
“Our party holds that such is a veiled approval for agencies to cook-up statistics, distort facts and fabricate false performance indices for the Buhari presidency, a situation that will worsen our national challenges and return our nation to a pariah state,” the statement added.
It challenged the presidency to name a particular statistics from any credible international organisation that distorted facts on the reality of the failures of his administration.
PDP noted that the directive to the Economic Advisory Council, casts a huge shadow on the credibility of the council and the reliability of the statistics it eventually comes up with.
