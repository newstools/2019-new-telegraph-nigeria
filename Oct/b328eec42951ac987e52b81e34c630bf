Boris Johnson has said he will press on “undaunted” with his Brexit strategy despite MPs backing the principle of a further delay to the process, The PM has vowed to introduce legislation needed to implement his agreement in Parliament next week, reports the BBC. But he will have to ask the EU for an extension beyond October 31 after MPs backed a motion designed to rule out a no-deal exit by 322 votes to 306. The EU said it was up to the UK to “inform it of the next steps”. The motion, which was tabled by Independent MP Sir Oliver Letwin, “withholds approval” for Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal until legislation implementing it has been passed. It was due to be followed by a vote on the main government motion – whether or not to back the deal. The defeat is a serious setback for the PM, who has repeatedly insisted that the UK will leave at the end of the month come what may. But Johnson said he was not “daunted or dismayed” and he still believed the best thing for the UK was to leave the EU later this month on the basis of his “excellent deal”. “I will not negotiate a delay with the EU and neither does the law compel me to do,” he said. He said he did not believe the EU would be “attracted” by a further delay and his policy remained “unchanged”. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the defeat represented an “emphatic” rejection of the PM’s strategy and he must now comply with the law in seeking a further extension. The Democratic Unionists, who backed the Letwin amendment, said the delay would allow for further scrutiny of the PM’s agreement – emphasising that its support would depend on preserving the “constitutional and economic” integrity of the UK.
