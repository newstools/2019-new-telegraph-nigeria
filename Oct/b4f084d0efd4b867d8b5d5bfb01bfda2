At least 95 graduates who presented fake certificate have been apprehended by the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), and handed over to security agencies during the last orientation exercise. Making this disclosure on Wednesday, the Director-General, NYSC, Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim threatened to blacklist any institution caught including the names of unqualified persons for mobilization into the NYSC. According to him: “We apprehended about 95 graduates with fake certificates from Nigerian and foreign universities.” Speaking in Minna, Niger State on Wednesday at the 2019 Batch ‘C’ pre-mobilization workshop, he said that 65 out of the arrested graduates were from universities in Nigeria while 30 others were from other West African universities. Accordingly, he said: “Regarding fraudulent certificates, we have apprehended 65 fake students from universities in Nigeria and from other West African universities, we have arrested about 30. We have handed them over to the police for prosecution. “Some tertiary institutions in Nigeria still engage in the sale of degree and HND certificates and statement of results to unqualified persons in a bid to smuggle them into being mobilised for the NYSC scheme. “This attempt is threatening the credibility of the NYSC mobilisation process. This illegal action has grave implications for the socio-economic development of the country.”
