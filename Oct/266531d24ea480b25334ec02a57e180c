Families of the late Ayodele Solaja and Ogheneovo Ebobo have appealed to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State and the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, to order probe of the murder of the two young men. The families specifically appealed to Sanwo-Olu to look into the complicity of the Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in the matter. They said Ayodele and Ogheneovo were murdered in cold blood by a police team led by an inspector at Iba New Estate, Lagos, on Monday August 19, 2019. Speaking through their counsel, Adesina Ogunlana, the families said the claim by the police that the victims were robbers were unfounded since there was a video which had gone viral on the killing. They described it as extra-judicial and demanded appropriate sanctions for the said inspector and three of his colleagues, who perpetrated the heinous act. They said it was surprising that the killer policemen, who were already put behind bars, were released three weeks ago on the advice of the state Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Babajide Martins. Ogunlana bemoaned the delay by the Commissioner for Justice in acting on petitions against the killing and sudden turn around by the DPP on the matter. He also wondered why the police have refused to release the bodies of the victims to their families for burial. Ayodeleâ€™s father, Chief Mayowa Solaja, expressed hope that the murder of his son would bring an end to extra-judicial killings and police brutality in the state. He said Ayodele, who was a National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member, was murdered a day to his return to his state of primary assignment.
