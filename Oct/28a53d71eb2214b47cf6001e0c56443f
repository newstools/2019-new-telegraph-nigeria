Daredevil gunmen on Wednesday kidnapped Hon. Justice Chioma Nwosu-Iheme of the Appeal Court in Benin, the Edo State capital. Besides, the heavily armed men, during the incident, shot dead a police orderly attached to the judge before they abducted her The latest incident occurred about two months after a similar attack took place at Ramat Park in Ikpoba Okha Council Area close to Benin where kidnappers swooped on the Chief Medical Director of Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Professor Sylvanus Okogbenin where they killed two policemen attached to him. Prof. Okogbenin spent over one week with the captors before he was released even as medical workers went on strike to demand for his unconditional release before they resumed work. It was learnt that the kidnappers of Justice Nwosu-Iheme, numbering about four, who operated in a Toyota Voltron car, had in a commando fashion emerged suddenly from nowhere and overtook the jeep conveying the justice and other occupants. They had immediately opened fire, killing the police orderly, an Inspector on the spot. The kidnappers also shot the tyres of the jeep forcing the driver to stop at which they hurriedly whisked her away into their own car and zoomed off to unknown destination. The four-man gang were said to have trailed the judge along Benin-Agbor Road near Christ Chosen Church close to the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), depot in Benin City while she was on her way to Abuja. Commissioner of Police in the state, DanMallam Mohammed when contacted on Wednesday confirmed the incident.
