Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have seized a foreign oil tanker in the Gulf that was smuggling fuel to Arab states, Iran’s state TV reported, adding that seven sailors onboard the tanker had been detained. “The IRGC’s naval forces have seized a foreign oil tanker in the Persian Gulf that was smuggling fuel for some Arab countries,” the broadcaster quoted the IRGC commander, Ramezan Zirahi, as saying. “It carried 700,000 litres of fuel. Seven sailors onboard of the tanker, who are from different nationalities, were detained.“ Last month, Iran seized a British tanker in the strait of Hormuz for alleged marine violations and allowed a second ship to proceed after issuing a warning, reports Reuters.
