     Doctors and nurses at Alex Ekwueme Federal Teaching Hospital Abakaliki (AEOFETHA) are battling to save the life of a two weeks old baby girl at Neo-natal ward of the hospital who was dumped by her teenage mother who then fled. This is even as the police in the state have commenced investigation into the matter. The baby was dumped inside a sack and put under a staircase at female surgical ward of the hospital. A cleric, Pastor Dan Orji, had gone to the female ward to see his sick wife when he heard the cry of the baby who was struggling inside the bag she was kept by the mother and raised the alarm which attracted security agents who came and contacted the management. He said: “This morning as early as 7:30, I was contacted and I soon I was contacted because my wife was admitted in the hospital, I rushed to FETHA 2. On entering the ward I heard a baby crying but I didn’t see any mother there. I was shocked and looked again and the cry persisted. Lo and behold, behind a staircase I saw a bag and peeped inside it. I saw a baby struggling inside the bag and I immediately shouted. “People came out from the ward and started shouting saying who did this! Who did this!! The nurses came down from upstairs and brought out the baby. The baby was well dressed, beautiful baby girl. They took her upstairs and started treating her. “The person who dumped the baby in the staircase was very sharp, I don’t know he or she beat security men and came into the ward, dropped the baby and then left. The baby appeared to have been about two weeks old. Is like is one of these single ladies that took in and maybe she didn’t want people to know she was pregnant and gave birth. She didn’t want to kill the baby and that’s why she came and dropped the baby here where she will be saved so that people can take care of the baby.” The Public Relations of the hospital, Oji Uzodimma confirmed the incident.
