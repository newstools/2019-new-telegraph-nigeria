Imo State Governor, Chief Emeka Ihedioha Wednesday inaugurated members of his State Executive Council with a  charge to them ‘to hit the ground running’ and key into his rebuilding agenda designed to reclaim the state from ruins.
The governor, who  performed the ceremony at the expansive Imo State Trade and Investment Centre, New Owerri, explained that it took him some time to choose the commissioners to ensure that round pegs are put in round holes to move the state forward.
Prominent among the commissioners sworn in is a former Minister of  State (Foreign Affairs) and later Education Professor Viola Adaku Onwuliri, who takes charge of the Education Minitsry and a former Deputy Speaker  of the state House of Assembly, Chief  Chuma Nnaji who will be in charge of the Ministry of Public Utilities.
The governor, who decried the state of decay of infrastructures in the state, blamed his immediate past predecessor for unduly proliferating ministries, 31 in all, many of which he said bore no relevance to the yearnings and  aspirations of the people even when pensioners and workers were not paid.
Expressing his resolve to put smiles on the faces of the embattled pensioners, the governor pledged to commence aggressive road  construction and where necessary rehabilitation in all parts of the state as soon  as the rains cease.
