Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, yesterday condemned the killing of Revd Father David Tanko of St. Peter’s Catholic Parish, Kufai, Amadu, in neighbouring Taraba State by gunmen. The cleric was reported to be on his way to Takum for a peace meeting with his fellow clergymen on how to resolve the lingering crisis between the Tiv and Jukun when he was ambushed and shot several times before his corpse was set ablaze.  Tanko was said to have been ordained in 2008 and spent most of his life in Kano State before coming back to his Diocese in Jalingo. Ortom, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary (CPS), Mr. Terver Akase, described the gruesome murder of the priest as “shocking, painful and unfortunate.”  He commiserated with the government and people of Taraba State, particularly the Catholic Church over the sad incident. The governor enjoined his Taraba State counterpart, Darius Ishaku, to call for an end to the bloodletting between the Jukun and Tiv in Taraba State, adding that only peace can guarantee meaningful development.  He urged security operatives to apprehend killers of Reverend Father Tanko to face consequences of their act. Ortom also consoled the family of the late Catholic priest and prayed that God grants him eternal rest.
