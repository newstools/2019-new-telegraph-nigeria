Sola Adeyemo, Ibadan  A self-acclaimed evangelist, but a trickster, Akinjide Durojaiye, was on Thursday beaten black and blue for stealing two units of Techno mobile phones in an office within Femi Johnson Building in Dugbe area of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. Durojaiye, 49, who claimed to be an evangelist at Dominion Assembly, Ilare-Ijesa in Osun State, was at the office where mobile phones and their accessories were being sold, to preach the gospel to the occupants. Entering the shop, Durojaiye claimed that he came from Ilare-Ijesa on an evangelism mission to Ibadan, and that the ‘holy spirit’ had directed him to the office to preach to them and get some people converted. While the occupants of the office were engrossed in the ministration, Durojaiye was said to have stealthily taken the phones but he was apprehended by the attendants and other onlookers at the office. The two packs of handsets were said to have been valued at N70,000.
