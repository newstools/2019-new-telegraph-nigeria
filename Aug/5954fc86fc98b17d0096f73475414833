At least 23 people are dead and 13 injured after an arson attack caused a fire at a bar in Mexico on Tuesday night. The fire broke out at the White Horse bar in Coatzacoalcos in the southern state of Veracruz, the prosecutor’s office in Veracruz said in a statement. 15 of the deceased are men and 8 are women, according to the prosecutor’s office. No arrests have been announced so far. The Veracruz Public Security Secretary and the prosecutor’s office said they were working to locate the suspects involved, reports CNN. Cuitláhuac García Jiménez, the governor of Veracruz, condemned the attack on Twitter. “Just like in Minatitlán where we found those responsible, the crime that happened a few moments ago in Coatzacoalcos will not go unpunished. In Veracruz, criminal groups are no longer tolerated,” García Jiménez said, referring to the shooting of 13 people at family party in Minatitlán, Veracruz in April.
