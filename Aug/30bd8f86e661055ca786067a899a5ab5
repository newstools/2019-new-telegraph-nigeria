Following reports by some bodies planning to embark on mass action against government, the leadership of the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC) has dissociated itself from such, saying it has no planned mass action or street protest in the country for now. According to a statement signed by the President, TUC, Comrade Quadri A. Olaleye,  the congress also stated unequivocally that it was not in league with any group whatsoever for any mass action in any part of the country. It further stated that there were no issues in contention with any public authority that has not been subjected to social dialogue that will now require extra ordinary means or action to resolve. The congress further stated that if such issues arise, the labour centre would go through its internal mechanism to procure authority for such an action, bearing in mind that its organs must be properly briefed and thorough debates will be undertaken before the organs can give approval. “In this case no issue has arisen, no organ has been summoned, and  no debate has been undertaken, therefore no such decisions has been taken. “TUC, however, holds the opinion that any group or groups reserve the right to express themselves in any manner they deem fit taking into cognisance the laws of the land. “TUC remains committed to the corporate existence of this country in which all manner of people enjoy the right of citizenship,” the statement added.
