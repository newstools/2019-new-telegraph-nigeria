A 10-year-old girl, simply identified as Masenengen, who was displaced by a Fulani herdsmen attack in Benue State on Monday delivered a baby girl.
Mbasengen, who got impregnated by a yet to be identified rapist now on the run, hails from Guma Local Government Area of the state.
The victim, who is also an orphan, New Telegraph learnt, got impregnated by the pedophile and later relocated along with her uncle to the North Bank area of Makurdi where the perpetrator allegedly raped her and put her in the family way.
It was gathered that Masenengen was in labor for three days before her uncle later took her to the General Hospital, North Bank, Makurdi where a Good Samaritan took her picture and posted her story on the social media on Sunday night.
Her story immediately caught the attention of Ukan Kurugh, a humanitarian activist, who alongside other activists, rushed to the hospital and transferred her to the Foundation Hospital in Makurdi where she was delivered of her baby weighing 2.5kg through C-Section at about 3 am on Monday morning.
When New Telegraph visited the Foundation Hospital, hordes of people from all walks of life were seen moving in and out to have a glimpse of the young girl and her baby.
It was also learnt that several other individuals both from within and outside the country have also continued to call in to make one donation or the other towards assisting the little girl and her baby.
However, National Coordinator of Jireh Doo Foundation, Ms. Josephine Habba, who was at the hospital, said the victim has named the perpetrator adding that until she would not relent until the rapists is apprehended and made to face the wrath of the law.
