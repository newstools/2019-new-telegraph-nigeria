In a bid to fulfill its promise of tackling rape and child abuse in the state, the Ekiti State Government has started public naming/ shaming of convicted sex offenders in the state.  The state’s Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Olawale Fapohunda, had earlier this year issued a statement on practical measures aimed at curbing sexual violence in the state.  Fapohunda had said: “The state government is concerned about the frequency of reported cases of sexual violence. It has therefore become necessary to put in place proactive measures to halt this trend. One of these measures include public notification of the status of convicted sex offenders by showing their photographs on Ekiti State Broadcasting Service and announcing their names on radio stations in the state.”  According to a statement issued yesterday, the state noted that: “The Ministry of Justice has today began the publication of the names and photographs of convicted sex offenders in the state. “We are commencing with a public notice on the status of Reverend Asateru Gabriel, a former Anglican priest who was convicted for sexually abusing a seven – year – old girl. Reverend Gabriel is currently serving a five – year prison sentence in Federal Prisons, Ado Ekiti.  “This publication is in furtherance of the Fayemi administration’s zero tolerance policy for all forms of violence against Women and Children.” Other additional measures to curb sexual violence in the state as announced by Fapohunda include: “Pasting the photographs of convicted sex offenders in prominent public spaces in their communities and their Local Government Headquarters; issuing an advisory to the traditional ruler of the sex offender’s community on the status of the offender.
