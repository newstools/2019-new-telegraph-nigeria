A youth group in Akwa Ibom State, Itu Youth Development Forum (IYDF), has denied allegations by the management of Power Holding Electricity Distribution Company (PHEDC) that its leader, Ubong Akpan, incited protest and barricade of the Afaha Ube Power Transmission station yesterday to achieve his self-aggrandizement.  According to a statement signed by their leaders and made available to journalist in Uyo, the group described the allegations as misleading and unfounded given that the said protest was not embarked upon by West Itam youth alone as claimed by PHEDC, but the entire youths of the 79 villages in Itu Local Government Area.  The statement reads: “The atten tion of Itu Youths Development Forum has been drawn to the fake news being peddled and propagated by management of Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution PHED, claiming that Obong Ubong Akpan has been making personal demands from them and that because they failed to meet his demand he decided to organise a protest.  “There is a deliberate attempt by the incompetent PHEDC management to mislead the uninformed citizens of our state and we wish to draw the attention of the Presidency, National Assembly, Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission, NERC, Security agencies and the general public to the following facts.  “In April 2019, a stakeholders meeting was held at the palace of the Paramount of Itu local government area, and a team from PHED, the Council Chairman, Head of DSS Itu, the two DPOs in Itu, the media, Chairmen of the 79 village Councils were present
