A group, Biafra Zionists Federation (BZF), yesterday described as an act of cowardice by the police which cordon-off strategic public places in Enugu State following its plans to declare the state of Biafra. Leader of the group, Benjamin Onwuka stated this in a speech he released to journalists shortly after his acclaimed inauguration as President of the BZF. Onwuka had a few weeks back announced that he would be inaugurated as Biafra President on Tuesday, July 30, at the Michael Okpara Square, Enugu. He also capped it up by releasing a list of ministerial nominees. However, from the eve of July 29, the police took over strategic locations in the State, including the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium Enugu, among other places in a bid to stop Onwuka and his group from carrying out their plans. Onwuka described the lockdown as an exercise in futility and an act of cowardice. He said: “This is to inform the entire world that myself, Benjamin Igwe Onwuka has been sworn in as the President of the Republic of Biafra. “The federal government encircled Enugu with heavy security to stop the swearing-in, but we had a successful swearing-in in Enugu at the full glare of his desperate security. Despite the lockdown of Enugu, we achieved it. “It was a futile attempt and an act of cowardice to barricade public places just in a bid to stop the Zionists but they failed. We succeeded because of the full diplomatic support of the United States of America. “Okpara Square and other parts of Enugu were surrounded with heavy security but they failed to stop the swearing-in of Zionists leader, Onwuka as Biafra President.”
