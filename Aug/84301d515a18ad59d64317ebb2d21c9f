Three members of a local vigilance group in Ijebu-Igbo, Ogun State have been arrested for the alleged murder of one Ahmed Obisanwo, a 400-level student of the Olabisi Onabanjo University (OOU), Ago-Iwoye.
The suspects, who were paraded on Wednesday by the state Commissioner of Police, Bashir Makama, allegedly dumped the corpse of the slain student into the river after the dastardly act.
The suspects included 55-year-old Salisu Akeem; Segun Ogunsanwo and Idowu Ayodele, who are both aged 53.
Briefing reporters at the state police headquarters, Eleweran, Abeokuta, Makama disclosed that four guns and some live cartridges, among other exhibits, were recovered from the suspects.
The police boss explained that the suspects had on August 8, this year, invaded a hotel in Ijebu-Igbo and nabbed two young men, dispossessing them of their valuables.
He said while the suspects later released one of the men in captivity, they held on to the other, whose remains have not been seen till date.
Makama stated that upon receiving complaint, the police swung into action and arrested the suspects who claimed to be members of Yaluwon Community Security group in Ijebu-Igbo.
