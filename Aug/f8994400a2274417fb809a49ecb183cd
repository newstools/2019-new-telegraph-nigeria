I t is hard time for hangers-on, who depend on public office holders for survival. These hangers-on, who usually seize opportunity of any political gathering as time of merriment experienced the shock of their lives during a recent birthday bash by one of their benefactors.   Expecting that the usual gifts that normally come with such gathering to flow, supporters of the politician, whose party in now in opposition, got the shock of their lives, when their benefactor told them that he would rather educate them on how to key into the various programmes of the government and engage in meaningful ventures that will change their lives than to doll out cash as usual.   No doubt, the piece of advice didnâ€™t go do well with the hangers-on as there was a sudden switch in their moody, but the party bigwig maintained that it is time people start engaging in meaningful ventures rather than hoping on handouts from politicians.
