Nigerian Afro-Fusion singer, Burna Boy, has clarified the controversy that ensued after his name was “written in small fonts” on the lineup for the 2019 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. He said he had criticised the organisers of the event not just for himself as an “African Giant”, but so that other African artistes coming after him wouldn’t have to go through such “denigration”. The ‘Anybody’ singer disclosed this when he featured on ‘The Daily Show’, an American late-night talk and news satire television program hosted by Trevor Noah, South African comedian. He said: “I was on a toilet seat and then my mum calls me and told me we’re doing Coachella. I was like ‘that’s nice!’ I got off and then got on the gram. I checked the lineup. I was looking for my name and couldn’t find it. I was like ‘Am I really performing here? “She then had to circle it for me because the name was so small on the poster. That’s never happened to me before. I’m used to being the African Giant. I didn’t like it. I expressed myself. “I was like it should be the same thing as all other international artistes that were there. Not just for that but so that those coming after me don’t have to go through that.” The ‘Ye’ singer appeared on the show alongside Mark Sanford, a former US representative and ex-governor of South Carolina, and delivered a performance of ‘Ye’, his critically acclaimed 2018 single. In a recent interview, the singer had said ‘African Giant’ wasn’t what he was initially working on; the project was only birthed by the need to “make a statement” to justify his Coachella outburst.
