A Kenyan chef has set a new world record for the longest time spent cooking, after cooking for 75 hours non-stop. Maliha Mohammed began her attempt on Thursday at 10:00 local time in the coastal city of Mombasa. She ended her marathon at a local restaurant on Sunday at 13:03 local time. If verified by Guinness World Records, she will have beaten the official record set by a US cook, Rickey Lumpkin – he cooked for 68 hours, 30 minutes and one second in April 2018 Ms Mohammed prepared 400 dishes – including local and international recipes – most of which she offered to shelters and orphanages. During her epic time in the kitchen, she only rested for 30 minutes every 12 hours. Afterwards she told journalists: “The journey has been tiresome. My legs are very painful, my eyes are hurting due to lack of enough sleep, but I’m grateful to have achieved this.” Ali Hassan Joho, Mombasa’s governor, congratulated the 36-year-old, who becomes the first African to break the record, reports the BBC. He wrote on Facebook: “You have not only made Mombasa and Kenya proud but the entire African continent. “You personified the true spirit of endurance and resilience in an African woman, in braving the heat and daring sleep for over 75 hours while showcasing your culinary skills.”
