Former Super Eagles forward Femi Opabunmi has tasked the Flying Eagles and Falconets players representing Nigeria in the men and women football events of the 2019 African Games to use their performance as springboard to the senior national teams. Both Nigeria U-20 sides are in the finals of the competitions and Opabunmi has weighed in on the teams’ outings in Morocco. “We have not been watching the teams play but it  is commendable that the U-20 sides have apparently put in more than 100% in their matches. “So far it’s been a good African Games and I want to salute our teams,” Opabunmi told allnigeriasoccer.com on Wednesday. “They must continue to do well whenever they play at this level or in the U-23s. They should see this as a stepping stone to the senior national teams. ”Yes, these players can play in the Super Eagles and Super Falcons in the nearest future,” Opabunmi, who was the youngest player at the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Korea/Japan at the age of 16 said. Nigeria’s Flying Eagles will face Senegal in Friday’s final in the men’s football event while the Falconets will play Cameroon in the final of the women’s football event.
