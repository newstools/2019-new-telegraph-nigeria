 The Falconets edged their Cameroonian counterparts, the Lionesses, to clinch gold in the football event of the Africa Games on Thursday. The Falconets enjoyed support from Sports Minister, Sunday Dare, who went straight to the team on arrival for the Games on Wednesday night. As expected, the match was keenly contested with both sides having played out a 1-1 draw in their group meeting but it was Nigeria that triumphed 3-2 in the penalty shootout. Fulltime score was goalless. In table tennis, youngster Jide Omotayo claimed his biggest career title edging favourite, Aruna Qaudri, to the gold medal in the Menâ€™s singles on Thursday. Omotayo has been in great form heading to the Games as he ruffled the feathers of Egyptian star Omar Assar in the Nigerian Open which served as warm-up tournaments for the quadrennial games. The gold rush for Team Nigeria also continued in wrestling as World No 3 Odunayo Adekuoroye overwhelmed Emmam Ibrahim of Egypt 10-0 in the final of the 57kg class. Same for Aminat Adeniyi as she retained her African Games title in the 62kg class. Commonwealth champion Blessing Oborududu overpowers Anta Sambou of Senegal 6-0 via pitfall in the final of the 68jg category African champion Blessing Onyebuchi beats Ivorian Amy Youn 10-0 to land the top prize in the 76kg class. Nigeria thus leapfrogged South Africa to move to second place on the standings with Egypt topping the log.
