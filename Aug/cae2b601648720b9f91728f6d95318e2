A new research from India has suggested that keto diet may benefit people with type 2 diabetes. The study team found that people following a ketogenic diet for three months saw significant improvement in their blood sugar control. Protein enriched foods are recommended on a ketogenic diet are shown like salmon, fruits, eggs, cheese and nuts. On a keto diet, people often don’t have grains, breads or cereals. Often, even fruits and vegetables are restricted. The diet requires a big change in lifestyle. “A five to 10 per cent carbohydrate diet over three months led to a remarkable reduction in hemoglobin A1c levels,” said study author Dr. Angati Kanchana Lakshmi Prasana. Kanchana is a consultant biochemist at CARE Hospitals in Visakhpatnam, India. Hemoglobin A1c is a blood test that estimates average blood sugar control over the past two to three months. In general, people with diabetes are advised to have an A1c level of seven per cent or lower. It’s still up for debate whether it’s this specific diet that causes improvement, eating fewer carbohydrates or simply the fact that people lose weight on the diet. Dr. Genevieve Lama is an endocrinologist at NewYork-Presbyterian Medical Group Hudson Valley in New York. She said that when people lose weight, their blood sugar levels go down. And it doesn’t take a huge weight loss to make a difference. She said losing just five per cent of your weight has an impact on blood sugar levels. Plus, a low-carbohydrate diet is known to reduce blood sugar levels, she said.
