Police said they had arrested 85 suspects and recovered over 300 animals as well as N6 million from bandits terrorising Niger State. The state Commissioner of Police, Usman Adamu, who made the disclosure yesterday at the Police Officers Mess, Minna, said the arrests were between June and August. Adamu commended and rewarded 15 officers for their gallantry. The commissioner said among those arrested were two linked to the abduction of Magajin Garin Daura (District Head of Daura), Alhaji Musa Umar, kidnapped on May 1. He said: “In the period under review, two out of the eight suspects arrested by our men were linked to the kidnapping of Magajin Daura, in Katsina State and at the time he was still in captivity. A development that led to the transfer of the case to Force Headquarters, and the victim was eventually rescued unhurt.” The police chief added that the suspects were not paraded at the time of arrest for security reasons. “This made some members of the public to cast aspersions on the case. But, I want to reveal to you that two of the eight suspects arrested were linked to Magajin’s kidnap, at that time he was still in captivity,” Adamu said. The commissioner also disclosed that operatives of the Operation Puff Adder arrested suspected kidnappers and recovered N6 million which was one of the suspects’ share of the proceeds linked to the abduction of the son of a monarch in Ibadan, Oyo State. Other items recovered, according to him include, N39,000, undisclosed amount of foreign currencies, 290 cattle, six camels, six donkeys, one horse. He said the animals had been transferred to Zamfara State. The commissioner also gave assurance that his men would be fully on ground during the Sallah celebrations to ensure peaceful festivity, maximum security and orderliness. He, however, solicited the cooperation of all Niger State citizens to complement the effort of the police.
