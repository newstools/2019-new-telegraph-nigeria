T wo brothers, Stephen and Fred Emefiele, along with their partner, Oseghale Collins, have been arrested in connection with cybercrime.  The suspects were arrested by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Benin Zonal Office, in Benin, Edo State.  Collins, who allegedly specialised in Business Email Compromise (BEC), was arrested with the two brothers for alleged involvement in internet fraud.  Fielding questions from investigators, Collins said that he specialised in BEC and that his modus operandi was to search for his victims’ email addresses, especially official business email addresses, create a phishing link and compromised the process in order to defraud unsuspecting victims.  The EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, confirmed the arrest of the three suspects.  He said: “When operatives arrived their apartment in the Government Reservation Area (GRA), Benin City, they met what appears to be a work station of laptops, printer, internet modem, flash drive, with which they operate. The commission also recovered a Mercedes Benz ML 350 from the suspects. The suspects have made useful statements and will be charged to court as soon investigations are completed.”
