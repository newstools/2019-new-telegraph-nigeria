S ometimes, the lavish lifestyle displays by our celebrities become a cause for concern to fans who feel like they are not making enough money to live the way they do. Nollywood actress, Dayo Amusa, recently explained how she makes money on Instagram after curious fans noted how she travels round the world and eats the most delicious meals. Amusa explained that she makes her money from her numerous jobs which include being an actor, a filmmaker, a brand ambassador, influencer and other business ventures. Excerpts from her post reads: “You may see me on Instagram enjoying a vacation, a fancy dinner or coffee but what you don’t see in details are the work done in between each of my posts where I’m too busy to even scroll through the app! You don’t see the days that I come home so late into the night, exhausted, my feet aching from running around. You don’t see me on those busy, anti-social night shifts as I’m responding to work and you don’t see the days like today where I am at home in my pyjamas eating whatever leftovers I can find in the fridge!. Recall, Dayo Amusa recently flaunted her brand new exotic car on social media. Even though the name of the car was not revealed, the Bentley logo was very visible in the video posted on Instagram and it is obviously a multi-million naira acquisition.
