Three lucky customers have won an allexpense- paid trip to the Interswitch One Africa Music Fest taking place in New York this month courtesy of Quickteller, a consumer payment platform of Pan-African integrated digital payments company,  Interswitch. Olawale Akanbi, Group Head, Quickteller Marketing, said it is a way of giving back to the customers for their unwavering support and belief in the brand.  “The success of Quickteller would not be possible without our loyal customers and we want them all to feel like a part of the family and that with Quickteller, everything is possible. So we will be sending a total of thirty lucky customers with an all-expense-paid trip to one of the Interswitch One Africa Music Festivals taking place in New York, London and Dubai,” he said.  Further, Akanbi stated: “In addition to the three winners we have already announced, we have twenty-seven more to go.  In a couple of days, we will select and announce more winners for the London trip. Later in the year, we will conduct the draws for the Dubai trip.”  The first three winners: Titilope Adedokun, David Eze and Owosegun Shonowo will be sponsored to the Interswitch One Africa Music Fest in New York on Saturday, August 10. Reacting to the surprise, one of the three, David Eze, said: “I gave up on promos a long time ago.  This is a huge surprise for me and I’m still in shock. Funny thing is, I applied just because I wanted to, and not really because I thought I would win. I am totally elated that I get to have my vacation in New York at the Interswitch One Africa Music Fest.”
