A man, Mr. Saheed Jimoh, yesterday accused soldiers of killing his younger brother, Dare Adelani, in cold brother. Some soldiers, who invaded the Isheri Olofin community in Ogun State during the annual Isheri day celebration, allegedly killed Adelani and another man during a disagreement with youths. The grieving Jimoh explained that the soldiers didn’t only plunge the family into mourning; they dealt them a severe blow, which family members were not sure how to handle. Jimoh, who described the deceased as a jovial man, said since Adelani was murdered, his parents had been heartbroken and inconsolable. He said: “I want the government to help us; I want justice for my brother who was murdered in cold blood.” Jimoh explained that aside from grieving, they were also worried on how to raise money to bury Adelani. He said: “We have already paid money to ensure that the corpse is deposited in the mortuary. We’re also spending money to follow up with the investigation.” Four soldiers on Wednesday allegedly killed two people and injured seven. Adelani was one of the dead. A youth leader in the community, Adeola Lukman, said that the issue of soldiers in the community was becoming unbearable. Lukman also spoke about soldiers’ harassment of residents in the community. He said: “It has reached the extent that when husband and wife are having issues, it would be because the wife is having affair with a soldier. The soldier in question will harass the woman’s husband. In fact, when two young men have issues, anyone of them, who have contact of a soldier, would invite him to come and intimidate the other, causing mayhem in the community. “The truth is that we need a police post in our community. If there is a police post, it would check soldiers causing problem. This is because the police, whose job it is to protect, would take charge of the community and other issues. The nearest police station is far; and it takes between two to three hours for them to get to our community.”
