Nigerian frontline kids’ foods company, AugustSecrets, has rounded off its flagship kids’ food fair amid pomp. The highly entertaining show staged on July 21 to the excitement of holidaying parents, guardians and children has gone into the record as the first ever kids’ foods fair staged in Nigeria.  The show which held at the Bay Lounge, Lekki, Lagos, aimed at showcasing new products as well as creating an avenue of fun and entertainment for families to mingle, dine, wine, interact and be properly catered to. It was an event filled with fun, laughter, games, and free gifts for all. According to the brand’s founder, Mrs Toyin Onigbanjo, “I understand the sacrifices parents make for their children’s comfort and well-being which is as it should be, but I also want parents to sit back and enjoy their time when they can.  The sole purpose of this fair, aside from the food exhibition and sales, was really to give parents the opportunity to just relax and enjoy themselves with the assurance that their children were properly watched over.” Those who graced the epochmaking event were pampered to a lush photo session with kidfriendly themes and shots perfect for Instagram uploads.
