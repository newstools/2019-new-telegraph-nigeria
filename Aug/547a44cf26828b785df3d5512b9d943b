A 70-year-old  cleric, Rev. Ogonna Nnachi  was among15 members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Movement for Actualization of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) arrested in Ebonyi State while
planning to hold their 2019 convention in the state.
The arrests came after the state government reminded IPOB  that it
remains an unlawful group after its proscription in 2017, warning that
it cannot tolerate its activity in the state.
The state’s Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Loveth Odah, in a release, said the  arrests were made possible through the collaborative efforts  of other sister security agencies in the state.
She disclosed that some of the Biafra insignia that were recovered from the group were Biafra currency (2 pounds), branded Biafra T-Shirts, caps and bangles.
