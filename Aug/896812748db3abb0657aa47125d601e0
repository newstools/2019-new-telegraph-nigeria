T he way and manner public office holders spend money at social events do attract them to praise singers and their supporters, who usually smile home with thousands of naira in their pocket. But the trend is changing gradually if recent events developments are anything to go by.   Recently some praise singers and political supporters who make fortune by singing praises of public office holders at events were disappointed by a lawmaker. The praise singers, who are mostly street urchins, got what they did not bargain for, as they were snubbed by the serving federal lawmaker despite their praises.   The member of the House of Representatives did not give the praise singers a dime despite calling him ‘Honourable’ and many other sweet names.  In annoyance, the street urchins resorted to calling the federal lawmaker all sorts of names to spite him for refusing to rub their palms like some of his colleagues.
