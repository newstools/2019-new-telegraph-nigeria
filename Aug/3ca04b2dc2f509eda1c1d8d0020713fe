The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) yesterday nabbed one Kingsley Unekwe for tampering with his result obtained at the last Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) from an original score of 201 to 269.  Unekwe, who had feigned ignorance of his crime, however, confessed to have tampered with the original result in the presence of his mother and officials of JAMB in Abuja.  Although he appealed to the board for clemency, the JAMB Registrar, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede, said not only would his result be withdrawn, but Unekwe would be handed over to security agencies for prosecution.  Oloyede who explained that Unekwe edited the original score allocated to him by the board and presented it to his parents as the original result, lamented that he was among candidates attempting to damage the image of the board. He said: “Anybody who does post-result infraction will have their results withdrawn by the board. You are the fifth person.  Two of them are already being prosecuted because we showed them clearly that they forged their results to deceive their parents who are desperate, like your parents, are to study medicine. “We will prosecute you for attempting to damage the image of the board. We told your father that we have all the facts, if we find out that the facts are not correct you will be prosecuted.”
