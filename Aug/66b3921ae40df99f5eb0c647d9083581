Nollywood actress, Adesua Etomi and Toke Makinwa, have taken to social media to urge for some time with Khafi, one of the housemate still in house for the Big Brother Naija 2019 ‘Pepper Dem’ edition.  The 33-year-old screen goddess and wife of singer, actor and politician, Banky W in a tweet late Tuesday, begged Biggie, as he is also called, to allow her some time with Khafi, perhaps as a celebrity guest like her husband in past editions.  “Dear Biggie, “pls I need only 5 minutes in the house.  I just want to tell Khafi something.  Just one or two words…,” she wrote in a tweet, which many believe is as a result of the number of times Khafi has been involved in sexual acts with fellow housemate Gedoni.  In another tweet, Adesua added: “Khafi is so genuine and so sweet. Wears her heart on her sleeve. Just wish she’d focus more on showing us how amazing she is.”  On her own, media personality, Toke Makinwa, is concerned male housemate, Gedoni, is only taking advantage of his fellow housemate, Khafi. Taking to social media to have her say about a pair that has become the most talked about in the house due to their often steamy under-the-sheets intimate sessions, Toke said Khafi is only fulfilling a need no matter what Gedoni says.   With Khafi getting upset with Gedoni after he refused to pick her for a task they were meant to do in groups, despite the fact that they are lovers recently, the OAP said comments made by Khafi during her diary session shows that she has a lot of childhood issues to deal with.  The requests by the actress and the former presenter of Trending on HipTV and vlogger, are not unconnected with the sex romps that have been going on between the Khafi and Gedoni.
