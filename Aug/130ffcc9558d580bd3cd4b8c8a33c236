T he Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has claimed that some “hoodlums” frustrated operatives’ attempts to search the residences of the immediate past Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode.   The Commission had earlier dismissed reports of a raid on Ambode’s Lagos residences.   A statement by EFCC’s Head of Media and Publicity, Mr. Wilson Uwujarem, said: “The attempt by operatives of the EFCC to execute a search warrant on the residences of a former Governor of Lagos State, Akinwunmi Ambode, was on Tuesday August 20, 2019, resisted by hoodlums loyal to the former governor.   “The thugs attacked the operatives and vandalized their vehicle.   “The Commission had obtained valid warrant to conduct search on Ambode’s residences in Park View, Ikoyi and country home in Epe, as part of on-going investigation of alleged malfeasance.   “However, the Commission’s operatives were attacked and prevented from executing the search warrant in Epe by irate youths who injured three officers and damaged EFCC official vehicle.”   Uwujarem further alleged that “the attack was totally unprovoked as the Commission’s operatives were civic and did not molest anybody.   “The Commission therefore frowns at the attempt to manipulate the video of the search to create the wrong impression that officers of the agency molested residents at the Epe home of the governor.   “It is also not true that the search was an attempt to plant foreign currencies in the home of the former governor.”
