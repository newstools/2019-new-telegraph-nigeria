An American-based businesswoman, Isabella Oshodin, was yesterday arraigned before the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja by the Federal Government, over an alleged N22.9 billion fraud. The businesswoman, whose husband, Bob Oshodin, was said to be at large, was arraigned on a 25-count charge bordering on sales of a furniture manufacturing company to the Federal Government to the tune of $55 million. Oshodin, who has been in the custody of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for about 70 days, pleaded not guilty to the charge. Amongst others, the defendant was said to have sold the company to the Federal Government in 2014 and received the alleged sum through the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) then under Col. Sambo Dasuki (rtd). The anti-graft agency also alleged that the defendant received the said amount in about 16 tranches through her family company, Bob Oshodin Organization Limited, which is the 1st defendant in the charge. The defendant was alleged to have, on the 16 occasions, received the sums of N500,000,000; N750,000,000; N125,000,000; N350,000,000; N170,000,000; N85,000,000; N60,000,000; N50,000,000 and others, which totalled N2,366,000,000 from ONSA under Dasuki (rtd). The anti-graft agency further alleged that the defendant, on eight occasions, received from Dasuki’s ONSA sums totalling $57,217,301.15 into the escrow accounts of Bob Oshodin Organisation Ltd. After pleading not guilty, prosecution counsel, Aisha Habib, prayed the court for a date for trial. Defense counsel, Osahon Idemudia, prayed the court to admit the defendant to bail in liberal terms pending the determination of the trial. While moving the bail application, Idemudia drew the attention of the judge to the fact that the defendant has been in the underground cell of EFCC for about 70 days without electricity. He further told the court that the alleged offence borders on civil contract freely entered by the Federal Government and that the defendant is committed to accelerated trial to enable her clear her name from the allegations. He, however, debunked the anti-graft agency’s claim that Oshodin jumped the administrative bail granted her by the agency, adding that EFCC did not make any attempt directly to get her, but only directed her surety to produce her. Idemudia, therefore, pleaded with the court to use its discretion in favour of the defendant, especially on conditions of her ill-health. The prosecution lawyer, Aisha Habib, however, objected to the bail application on the grounds that the defendant may likely jump bail if granted because her husband and all her children are based in the United States of America. Habib, however, submitted that if the court was inclined to grant the application, it should do so with some conditions that will ensure the defendant is available for trial. The trial judge, Justice Taiwo Taiwo, after listening to both parties, adjourned till tomorrow for ruling on the bail application. The court also ordered that the defendant remain in the custody of the Commission till the next adjourned date. Count two of the 25-count charge reads: “That you, Mrs. Isabela Mimie Oshodin, Bob Oshodin Organisation Ltd. and Mr. Robert (Bob) Oshodin (still at large) on or about 22nd June, 2014, in Abuja, within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, directly transferred the sum of $7,712, 598 to one Portfolio Escrow Company with account number 3102004330 domiciled in California Republic Bank, United States of America, which sum you reasonably ought to have known to be proceed of an unlawful act of Sambo Dasuki (rtd), the then National Security Adviser to wit: criminal breach of trust and you thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 15 (2) (b) of the Money Laundering (Provision) Act, 2011as amended in 2012  and punishable under Section 15(3) of the same Act.”
