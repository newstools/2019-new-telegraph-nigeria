The South East Governors’ Forum, Tuesday urged President Muhammadu Buhari to defer the closure of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu to end of October, to enable them make adequate security arrangements for airport users and people of the zone.  The governors wrote to the President requesting him to push the closure of the airport to the new date, instead of this Saturday as announced by the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN).  This is even as the governors also asked the President to approve  their earlier resolution  banning herdsmen without cattle and movement of cattle by foot in the zone to eliminate increasing cases of killing, maiming, raping of  women, kidnapping of the people and destruction of farmlands mostly carried out by foreign herdsmen with the backing of some compromised local herders.  The Federal Government, through the General Manager, Corporate Affairs, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, Mrs Henrietta Yakubu, had at the weekend revealed that it will  close the runway at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu for major repairs and works on the airfield.
