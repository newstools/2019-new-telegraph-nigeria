Abundant Life Gospel Church, Peace Arena, Pen Cinema, Agege, Lagos hosts top ministers at this year’s edition of Superfest, which takes place from August 7 to 9. According to the General Overseer of the church, Dr. Jane Onaolapo, leading the charge at this year’s event is Bishop of TREM, Dr. Mike Okonkwo, supported by other elite preachers like Pastor Matthew Ashimolowo, Pastor Wole Oladiyun, Bishop David Adeoye, Pastor Segun Johnson, and Pastor Adeyinka Adegbuyi. Onaolapo would minister at the two-day seminar. The theme of this year’s Superfest, according to the woman of God, is “A Burning and Shining Light (John 5: 35).” Each of the ministers is expected to speak on a specific subject during the two-day word feast. For more than a decade, Superfest has blessed thousands of attendees from across the world. It was the vision of the late founder/General Overseer of the Lagos-based mega-church, Bishop Kola Onaolapo, who went to be with the Lord some years ago. Since the passing of the bishop, his widow has kept the flag flying. About two years ago, Superfest was remodelled and expanded and is now held across the zones where the 14 branches of the church are located. Few years ago, the church adopted a congress format whereby attendees were given cash support and evangelical aids like motorcycles, megaphones, tracts, musical equipment, etc to promote the gospel.
