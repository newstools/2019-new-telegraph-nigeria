The National Leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has charged the newly appointed ministers to consolidate on the progress made so far by the Federal Government. The 43 ministers appointed by President Muhammad Buhari were yesterday inaugurated and assigned portfolios at the Aso Villa. The party, which commended the Buhari on the appointment of the ministers said it notes with utmost satisfaction the painstaking efforts the President made in picking them, their speedy screening and confirmation by the Senate, in addition to the rigorous induction of the new appointees towards acquainting them to the onerous task of assisting government to fulfill his promises of repositioning the economy, ensuring security of lives and property and fighting corruption. In a statement issued by APC’S National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, the party said: “While the APC-led administration has recorded remarkable milestones in these three areas, we align with the position of the President that there is more work to be done. “There are challenges to build on the foundations that have been laid in the last four years. To state a few, the APC-led government has an urgent task to lift Nigerians out of poverty, secure lives and property, grow our economy, build infrastructure, bring back discipline to our private and public conducts and mobilize Nigerians through personal examples towards evolving a Nigeria we all can be proud of.”
