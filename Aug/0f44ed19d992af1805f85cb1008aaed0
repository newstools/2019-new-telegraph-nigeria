Startling revelations emerged on Friday in Benin, the Edo State capital on how suspects plotted to execute a jail break to free a suspect being held at the Oko Prisons in the state. The shocking confession of a 40-year-old man, Oheneme Kingsley, exposed the secret deal that ultimately led to the foiled attempt. He disclosed that he paid N20,000 to some gunmen from the Ijaw extraction to break his brother out of the prison. Kingsley said his brother, Wisdom, an ex-policeman, was convicted for murder. He said he was asked to pay N200,000 but he could only raise N20,000. Kingsley was among the three suspects arrested for plotting to release some condemned prisoners inside the Oko Minimum Security Prison. Other suspects are Raphael Ebisin aged 34 and Amos Isuku aged 35. According to the suspect: “They called me that some Ijaws want to free their people from prisons and that I should pay N200,000 so that my brother can also be released but I told them I don’t have any money. “They said I should send N20,000 which they will use to contact some persons and I did. I sent the money and I was arrested. My brother sent me an account number from prison.” Raphael, who is an international driver, said he was contacted by his cousin, Hope, whom police described as a notorious kidnapper that had just left prison custody.
