 R esidents of Agbala community in Owerri North Local Government Area of Imo State yesterday rescued two herdsmen who were stabbed during a feud among herders over cows.   The community, which observed the attack on the herdsmen by their colleagues, on noticing that none of the parties in the feud was making any effort to save the stabbed and bleeding herders, alerted the police and assisted in the evacuation of the wounded for medical help. The two herdsmen saved by the villagers were rushed to the Emergency Unit of the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Owerri, owing to the gravity of injuries they sustained.   A witness from the community, who craved anonymity, told journalists that the feud among the herders occurred on Monday night and might have been misconstrued if not that another Fulani herder witnessed it from a distance.   He said: “What happened was that a Fulani herdsman had sneaked into the bush where his kinsman and his cows were camped and viciously stabbed him while the man was asleep. The multiple stabs suggest that the herders may have intended to hack his kinsman to death. “Apparently thinking he was dead, he left his victim in a pool of his own blood and took away his cattle.   “Unfortunately for the assailant, another Fulani herdsman who was in the bush quickly alerted other Fulani herdsmen nearby and monitored him until the other herdsmen arrived. On their arrival, they first confronted the assailant who was clearly outnumbered, recovered the stolen cows and then pounced on him, brutally stabbing him multiple times.   “It was at this point that the villagers stormed the area with a team of policemen, rescued the two badly stabbed herdsmen and rushed them to the emergency unit of FMC, Owerri.” However, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Orlando Ikeokwu, said that the two herders were responding to treatment at the hospital.
