 O ne of the hoodlums terrorising members of staff, students and other members of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) community has been sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.   The institution’s Public Relations Officer (PRO), Abiodun Olarewaju, said in a statement that the 23-year-old hoodlum, Odionye Wilson, was arrested by the security unit of the university pilfering the belongings of students sitting for their semester examination that were dropped outside as it was customary during examinations.
