 The Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Polytechnics (SSANIP), Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo (RUGIPO) chapter, yesterday kicked against sack of 42 teaching staff of primary and secondary schools owned by the institution. RUGIPO’s authorities had unfolded privatisation plans of both primary and secondary staff schools of the institution. The plans announced by Acting Rector, Mr. Gani Ogundahunsi, the teaching staff of the schools would see to the sack of teachers in the staff schools. Of 59 teaching and non-teaching staff, only 17 would be redeployed with the fate of the test 42 unknown. Ogundahunsi had said “the staff school of Rufus Giwa Polytechnic will be privatized and investors are being invited to take advantage of the business opportunity.” He went on: “As at now the cost of running the school is N74,000,000.00 in one year whereas the total income from the school every year is N4,000,000.00 This is not sustainable. “The Governing Council has therefore decided to privatize the school. “All the employees employed directly by the Polytechnic will return to the polytechnic Employment while efforts are being made to persuade the investors and the ministry of education to absorb other categories of employees but no person will lose his or her employment as a result of these changes in the corporate structure.” But the SSANIP yesterday expressed displeasure over the mass disengagement of the 59 workers at the Polytechnic’s Staff primary and secondary Schools. Chairman of the association, Mr. Chris Olowolade, who described the mode of the sack by the Management and Governing Council as unacceptable commended Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu for his timely intervention. Olowolade accused the Polytechnic’s authorities of treating the disengaged Staff School workers like lepers.
