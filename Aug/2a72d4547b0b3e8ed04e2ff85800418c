Nigeria and other African nations are to benefit from Diageo’s eco-initiatives in solar power projects. According to the organisation, Diageo would be ploughing $220 million into green energy projects at 11 of its African plants. Diageo’s eco-initiatives include solar power projects at its African sites The investment, Diageo’s biggest in green projects in a decade, according to owner, Johnie Walker, would cover biomass, solar and water-recovery initiatives. Under the plans, he said that three breweries in Kenya and Uganda would be fitted with biomass boilers, replacing systems powered by fuel oil and reducing carbon emissions by 42,000 tonnes a year. Meanwhile, he said that water-recovery and purification facilities would be rolled out across five sites in Kenya, Uganda and Nigeria. “The facilities are expected to save two billion cubic litres of water a year,” he said. The other countries included in the investment are Tanzania, South Africa, the Seychelles and Ghana. Diageo’s Chief Executive Officer, Ivan Menezes, said the organisation believed in biggest single investments in addressing climate change issues across sub-Saharan countries. Menezes said: “It demonstrates the strength of our commitment to pioneer grain-to-glass sustainability and to positively impact the communities in which we live and work.” The investment announcement follows a Diageo statement, last week, which confirmed the company will relocate jobs at a Kenyan back-office support hub to Europe and Asia.
