The Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, Olusade-Adesola, has warned the remaining Nigeria contingents at the ongoing African Games in Morocco, not to taint their gold medals with banned substance as he applauded them for the good works done so far. Speaking during a brief reward ceremony for the athletes who already won medals for the country at the championship, Adesola said all the athletes in Morocco are all winners as for them to have qualified to represent the country among over 180 million Nigerians, it has shown that they are a worthy ambassador. According to him, they should continue to give their all and work for the good name of Nigeria not minding any obstacles on the way. “I want to bring the good tidings of the president, Muhammadu Buhari and the minister of sports, Sunday Dare, to you,” he said. “I want to applaud all what you have been doing here in Morocco and i want you to continue in the same way. I want to rejoice with those people that have won something, for those still aspiring to do so, i wish you all the best and for those who are through with their events without winning anything, i will say there is still another time. “We will continue to support you in all ways and we want to use this opportunity to appreciate the president for what he has done in the area of funding, hopefully we can get more.” Meanwhile, Inemo Appah was the star attraction at the presentation of money to medallists on Tuesday as he was rewarded with $9,000 after winning three gold medals in weightlifting.
