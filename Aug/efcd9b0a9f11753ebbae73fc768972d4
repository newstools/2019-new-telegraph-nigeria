  The police in Benue State on Sunday apprehended a 60-year-old man, identified as Clement Ikechukwu Ogenyi, for allegedly raping a 4-year-old girl.  The minor, New Telegraph learnt, was sent to buy Vitamin C tablets from the suspect, who runs a patent medicine store within the neighbourhood, when he lured her into his room and abused her sexually.  But a relation, who noticed that the minor was walking awkwardly soon after she returned from buying the medicine, probed further by asking her questions and checking her private part.  “When the girl came home, we discovered she was walking funny. So, I took her inside my house and checked her after she revealed to me that Mr. Ikechukwu popularly known as ‘Ad’Egbo’ kissed and touched her mouth and private part with his penis.
“Immediately, I went to confront him (Mr. Ikechukwu) but he denied doing anything,” said the relation.
