Speaking at the event, which took place in Yenagoa, the Sector Commander, Ikechukwu Igwe in his opening remarks maintained that the command decided to put up the programme because of what they have observed in these religious organisations. He said it was a kind of proactive measure to avoid fatal accidents within any of the worship centres adding that they noticed that some of the people that control traffics within those worship centres were not properly trained. He said: “A times they get confused and get the populace confused through the way they behave and a times they don’t know where to tell vehicles to drop or pick up worshipers. So we decided to call them together to enlighten them. “Most of them don’t know how to cross children on the road and the elderly people. A time, their attention is focused only on motorists. They don’t know that the pedestrians are also road users.” Also speaking, the Deputy Commissioner of Police Bayelsa State, Selem Vincent Amachree advised road users to be safety conscious.
