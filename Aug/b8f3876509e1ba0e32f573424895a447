B arring any change in plan, the seven-man panel of investigation set up to investigate the circumstances surrounding the killing of three operatives of the Inspector General of Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), and two civilian’s by soldiers, will submit its report this week.   The IRT operatives had arrested the alleged kidnap kingpin, Hamisu Bala aka Wadume, in Ibi, Taraba State when they were attacked.   Consequent upon the killing, which had created bad blood between the Nigeria Police and Army, President Muhammadu Buhari had directed the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Gabriel Olonisakin, to cause an enquiry into the tragic incident.   Sources told New Telegraph that the Admiral Ibikunle Olaiya-led joint panel was set to turn in its report early this week.   After visiting Takum and Ibi, the location where the incident occurred, the panel was said to have retired to its Secretariat at the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), where it quizzed some senior and junior personnel of the Army and Police, including Wadume.   According to one of the sources, the panel concluded after days of diligently scrutinising evidence, statements as well as available documents.   The source said: “All things being equal, the joint panel will submit report to the CDS early next (this) week.   “Officers and men from both services, who were mentioned in the whole shooting and killing case, were interviewed by the panel, including the suspect at the centre of it, Hamisu Bala alias Wadume.”   Another source said in the event that Captain Tijjani Balarabe alleged to have given directive for the shooting was indicted; he was likely to face court-martial.   Asked what might be the fate of the soldiers, the source said: “The soldiers too may go for court-martial. Special Court Martial likely for all of them (if the panel indicted them). “If he (captain) is found culpable, he might be dismissed and jailed.”
