Others were two former local government council chairmen, Alhaji Musa Tsafe and Alhaji Ahmed Kantoma as well as two former Directors- General, Alhaji Bashir Kwaren Ganuwa and Alhaji Saminu Lawali. All the defectors are from Tsafe Local Government Area of the state. In their separate speeches, Alhaji Idris Keta and Alhaji Habibu Alo said they were drawn to the PDP because of the peace being enjoyed by their communities under the present leadership of governor Matawalle. They added that by addressing the security challenges facing the state within a short period, the governor has earned their trust and would support him to further ensure sustainable peace in the state. In his remarks, Matawalle commended the defectors for the “wise decision” to join the PDP and assured that they would receive equal treatment as any other party member.
