The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja yesterday ordered the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), to stay further action in the move to seize the property of the immediate past governor of Zamfara State, Alhaji Abdulaziz Yari. Justice Nkeonye Maha gave the order at the resumed hearing in the legal action instituted by Yari to challenge the anti-graft agency from confiscating his property.  The court had on Monday ordered AGF and EFCC to appear before the court yesterday to show cause why the request of Yari to restrain them from taking any action against his property should not be granted. But yesterday, counsel to EFCC, Hussaina Gambo, informed the court that they complied with the order of the court, but that the EFCC’s counter affidavit was filed late, hence not yet in the court’s file.  The AGF, represented by Abdulahi Abubakar, a principal state counsel in the Federal Ministry of Justice, also informed the court that the AGF had filed counter affidavit in compliance with the order of the court on why the AGF should not be restrained from taking action against Yari.  The counsel further told the judge that the AGF is a nominal party in the matter because the investigation of the former governor is being solely undertaken by the antigraft agency. However, counsel to Yari, Mahmud Magaji (SAN), pleaded with Justice Maha to make an order against the two respondents not to take any action against his client pending the determination of his fundamental human rights suit.
