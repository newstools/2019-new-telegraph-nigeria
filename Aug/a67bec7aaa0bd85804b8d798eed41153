The Department of State Services (DSS) picked up the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky, on his arrival at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, from India, where his planned medical treatment was cut short. El-Zakzaky arrived via an Ethiopian airline around 12.05pm and was driven away by the security operatives shortly after. The President, Media Forum of IMN, Ibrahim Musa, confirmed that IMN leader was promptly taken away by DSS operatives. El-Zakzaky, who left for Medenta Hospital, New Delhi, India, for medical attention, alongside his wife, Zeenat, on Monday on the approval of a Kaduna High Court judge, was allegedly forced to abort his treatment following the alleged refusal of the hospital management to allow his preferred doctors to treat him. The religious leader in a video released on Thursday, said he was given the option of having his treatment at the hospital or returning to Nigeria, noting that he was still discussing with his wife when unnamed officials returned to tell him to prepare for home. He also complained that he was placed under heavy security, adding that he was not allowed to move from his room to the next. He accused the governments of the United States, India, and Nigeria of frustrating his treatment. His allegations were, however, dismissed by the FG which accused him of making unreasonable requests including being allowed to stay in a five-star hotel and having unrestricted access to his visitors. The US also said it knew nothing about his claims, dismissing the allegations as baseless.
