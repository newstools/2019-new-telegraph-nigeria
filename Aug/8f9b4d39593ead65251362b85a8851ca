The National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has upheld the reports of the Screening and Appeal committees for the Bayelsa Governorship aspirants.  In a statement from the APC National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, the party said: “Of the seven governorship aspirants that were screened, six were cleared to participate in the governorship primary in Bayelsa State. They are: Mr. Aganaba Preye Steven, Sen. Heineken Lokpobiri, Prince Ebitimi Christopher Amgbare, Ms. Diseye Nsirim Poweigha, Mr. Lyon David Pereworimini, and Engr. Prof (Mrs.) Ongoebi Maureen Etebu.  “Dr. Briyai Oyeins Frankland was not cleared to participate in the party’s governorship primary.  “The APC NWC upheld the disqualification of Dr. Briyai Oyeins Frankland based on Section 3 Paragraph ‘L’ of the party’s guidelines for the nomination of candidates which requires that aspirants are card-carrying member of the party for a period of one year.
“The party also found no record of his membership of APC and was therefore considered ineligible.”
