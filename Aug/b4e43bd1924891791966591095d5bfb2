A 10-year-old girl, simply identified as Mbasengen, who was among those displaced by herdsmen attacks in Benue State, yesterday, delivered a baby girl. Mbasengen, who was impregnated by a yet to be identified rapist, hails from Guma Local Government Area of the state. The victim was impregnated by the pedophile after she and her uncle relocated to the North Bank area of Makurdi. It was gathered that Masenengen was in labour for three days before her uncle later took her to the General Hospital, North Bank, Makurdi, where a Good Samaritan took her picture and posted her story on the social media on Sunday night. Her story immediately caught the attention of Ukan Kurugh, a humanitarian activist, who alongside other activists, rushed to the hospital and transferred her to the Foundation Hospital in Makurdi. It was at the hospital that she was delivered of a baby girl, weighing 2.5kg through a Caesarean Section (C-S). She delivered at about 3 a.m yesterday. When New Telegraph visited the Foundation Hospital, hordes of people from all walks of life were seen moving in and out to have a glimpse of the young mother and her baby. It was also gathered that several other individuals, both from within and outside the country, have also continued to call in to make donations to help the mother and baby. However, National Coordinator of Jireh Doo Foundation, Ms. Josephine Habba, who was at the hospital, said the victim has named the perpetrator. Habba added that she would not relent until the rapist is apprehended and made to face the wrath of the law.
