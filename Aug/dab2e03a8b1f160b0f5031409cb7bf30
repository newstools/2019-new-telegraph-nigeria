Disputes over modalities to be adopted in the conduct of executive elections for Mosimi Depot under the Western Zone of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) have been resolved.   In resolving the dispute, Justice Chuka Obiozor of a Federal High Court in Lagos adopted the template used in resolving the disagreement which arose over the conduct of Executive election for the Satellite Depot of IPMAN’s Western Zone.   The Registered Trustees of IPMAN, IPMAN’s National President, Elder Chinedu Okoronkwo, National Secretary, Alhaji Danladi Pasali as well as three Executives of IPMAN Western Zone have dragged eleven members of the zone to court over the Satellite Depot election.   The three Executives of IPMAN Western Zone who are co-plaintiffs in the matter are: HRH Oba Obafemi Ogbaro, the Zonal Chairman IPMAN Western Zone; A8lhaji Adetunji Oloko, Zonal Secretary, IPMAN Western Zone and Alhaja Olayiwola Omotayo, Zonal Organizing Secretary, IPMAN Western Zone.   Some of the respondents in the suit are; Alhaji Debo Ahmed, Alhaji Ayo Alanamu, Chief Olatunji Aderoju, Mr. Lukman Olaogun, Elder Sanya Aluko and Bashorun Akanni Oyewole.   Others are; Kunle Bamigboye, Alhaji Dele Tajudeen, Prince Kunle Oyenuga, Pastor Gbenga Ilupeju and Mr. Lakin Olukanmi.   Parties in the suit later come together and reached a compromise on how to resolve the dispute over the Satellite Depot election. They agreed that each party shall nominate five persons each to conduct the election. The 10-man committee was chaired by HRH Oba Obafemi Ogbaro.   The resolution was subsequently adopted by the court as its ruling on the matter and the Satellite Depot Executive election was later successfully conducted on 22nd July, 2019.   The Mosimi Depot Executive elections scheduled to hold on 14th October, 2019, will now be conducted using the same template.
