Barely two weeks after a woman was strangled to death in a hotel room in the Olu-Obasanjo area of Port Harcourt, another woman was killed Thursday morning in Woji Road, GRA Port Harcourt.  Just like the killer of the first victim, Miss Maureen Ewuru walked away from the hotel room after committing the crime, the killer of the second victim identified as Jenifer Nwokocha, also walked away from the brothel undetected and unchallenged.  The lifeless body of Nwokocha, who was in her 20s and hailed from Umuekenyike, Obirikom in Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Local Government Area of Rivers State was discovered by a staff of the hotel.  According to sources, a white piece of cloth was tied around her neck, just like the killer of Ewuru had done, but it is early to conclude that the same person committed both crimes as investigation into the killings is ongoing.
