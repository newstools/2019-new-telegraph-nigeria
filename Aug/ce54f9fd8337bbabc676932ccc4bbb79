  A student of the Ondo State-owned Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko (AAUA) was on Wednesday evening allegedly raped by some soldiers at a military checkpoint at Ikare-Akoko in Akoko Northeast Local Government Area of the state.
The soldiers of  32 Artillery Brigade of the Nigeria Army, at Ikare-Akoko according to sources serially raped the lady whose identity has not been disclosed as at the time of this report.
According to a source, the soldiers, who were attached to the Ikare Akoko checkpoint allegedly raped the victim, a 300-level student of the Department of Religious and African Studies of AAUA,  while she was coming back from the campus.
A student of the institution, who witnessed the incident but did not want her name in the print for fear of harassment, said the soldiers at the Ikare checkpoint were fond of molesting the female students who passed-by the checkpoint.
But the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the State Command, Mr. Femi Joseph, however, said he was not aware of the incident.
Joseph said: “I have not been briefed about the matter, I will have to call the Ikare Division and I will call you back when I get the details.”
But reacting on behalf of the military, Brigadier General Zakari  L Abubakar said if there is such a complaint,  it should be presented at the Brigade Command in Akure for proper action.
Abubakar, who said it would be difficult for any of his men to be involved in such, said anyone  found guilty knows the penalty because military authorities do not take it lightly. He, however, appealed to the people of the state to assist them in ridding the state of kidnappers and other criminals.
