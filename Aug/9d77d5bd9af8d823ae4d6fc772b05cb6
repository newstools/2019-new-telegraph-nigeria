Former Special Adviser to the President on Niger-Delta Affairs and a frontline aspirant for the governorship of Bayelsa State, ‘Timi Alaibe, has congratulated Governor Henry Seriake Dickson and the Bayelsa State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the overwhelming success recorded by the party last Saturday in the local government election.
Alaibe said the success of the party and all the candidates—from chairmanship to the councillorship—is another proof that Bayelsa people have come to a common agreement that only the PDP-powered government can deliver satisfactorily on the dividends of democracy.
In a congratulatory message released in Yenogoa on Monday, Alaibe, who is also the former Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), equally congratulated all the eight local government council chairmen and their councillors for their victory at the polls.
He stated: “Your victory at the polls demonstrates the confidence the people of Bayelsa State have in Governor Henry Seriake Dickson, the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party in the state and in you as individuals. It is now left for you to justify this confidence by being servants of the people.
“You must see your election as an opportunity to serve the people. As you assume office soon, you must ensure that whatever you promised the people during your campaign is given to them. You must be ready to account for all your actions and inactions because that is what the people expect from you. As a leader, you are expected to listen to the people even if you cannot meet all their needs.
“Your victory would have been impossible if the party in the state under the leadership of Governor Dickson did not cultivate and sustain the trust of the people in the last four years through development plans.
“It will be my joy, by the grace of God, to work with you in a few months time when I am elected your governor so that together, we can continue from where he stops.”
