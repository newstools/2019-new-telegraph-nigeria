The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Niger State has expressed disappointment in the incessant allocation of a single slot and junior ministerial positions to the state by President Muhammadu Buhari, saying “we worked hard and delivered votes more than other states with either two ministers or that got senior ministries”.  It should be noted that Nigerians especially from various interest groups have continued to react over the portfolios recently allocated to the newly inaugurated ministers by the President.
While speaking to journalists on Sunday, a chieftain of the APC in the state and former Commissioner for Information  and Strategy, Honorable Jonathan Vatsa said: “We have been shortchanged for the junior minister position allocated to us in view of our contribution the party’s victory in the 2015 and 2019 elections.”  Vatsa, who was the APC’s former Publicity Secretary in the state, believed that the state deserved more than what it got, adding that the ministeries of Power and that of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, should have be given to Niger state especially as the state has only a slot. Accordingly, he said: “In 2015 we dismantled all the opposition parties structures in the state and made it a 100 percent APC state. Also, in 2019, we worked tirelessly and repeated the same feat; and we overwhelmingly delivered the state at all levels in the elections but unfortunately the only thing we got for our efforts was junior Ministers in 2015 and 2019. “In 2015, Bawa Bwari was given Minister of State for Solid Mineral Resources and now in 2019 Ambassador Zubairu Dada has been asked to take Minister of State for Foreign Affairs”.
