The Senator representing Niger East Senatorial District, Mohammed Sani Musa on Wednesday donated N5 million to victims of the flood in Minna, the state capital. Senator Musa, who paid a sympathetic visit to affected areas in Minna, appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to direct the Minister of Special Duties, who is in charge of ecological issues, to come to the aid of Niger State. According to him: “These people need succour especially with the economic situation of the country. Niger State cannot do it alone. Whatever little one can do for the people will be appreciated. On my own part, I am giving them N5 million to the different groups affected. It is the little I can do. “I came in this morning to commiserate with my people over the unfortunate flooding that occurred last week in my constituency. As you can see, it is still raining and this is happening in the city of Minna. A lot of people have lost their properties and houses.” Findings by the New Telegraph have it that the flood, which affected Bosso, Kpakungu, Fadipe, Dutsen Kura, Okada road, MYPA, Gbeganu, Shanu and other places, started from Tudun Fulani, in Bosso Local Government Area.
