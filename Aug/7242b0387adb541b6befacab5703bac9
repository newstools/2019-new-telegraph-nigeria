Super Eagles midfielder Oghenekaro Etebo has predicted a great national team that is based on a telepathic partnership he forms with Leicester City midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi. Etebo was the busiest Eagles player as Nigeria finished third at the last African Cup of Nations hosted by Egypt after he played every minute in the team’s campaign. Ndidi would have shared the same statistics but the former Genk of Belgium midfielder did not start Eagles’ last group game against Madagascar hence his partnership with Stoke City’s Etebo in the team’s middle of the park attracted great applause throughout the competition. In a chat with our correspondent, Etebo said their performance at the tournament suggested that the team could look into the future with optimism. He admitted that his own game had been lifted owing to the profound understanding he formed with Ndidi. The former Warri Wolves said Ndidi’s almost flawless reading of the game and immense talent had made his own job a lot easier and the squad would benefit a lot more if they are kept together. “Playing in all matches at AFCON was a great achievement that I am proud of it and I look forward to helping my country achieve greatness in the near future. Ndidi is a talented player and everyone can see how far he has developed. It is a great honour to play along side him because he is so good; I think I enjoy playing with him, he made my job easy and learn so much from each other. There are many talented players in the squad and he is one of the best in Africa. I know with players like Ndidi in the team, sky will be our limit. I know we will do a lot more with more playing time,” he said.
