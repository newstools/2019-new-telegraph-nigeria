Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) yesterday said it had intercepted and impounded a truck carrying 700 bags of smuggled rice worth N11,900,000. Addressing journalists, the Customs Area Controller, Niger/Kwara/Kogi Command, Abba-Kassim Yusuf, said it was very worrisome that some Nigerians had remained unrepentant even as they continued to lose their goods. He said: “With our campaigns against rice smuggling into the country, the Anti-Smuggling Command Patrol Team around Minna-Lambata-Suleja axis of the command, seized the truck with registration number XA 297 NAK transporting 700 bags of rice worth N11,900,000.” A few months ago, a similar seizure of a truck with registration number DAL 769 XA (DSR-1B-019) conveying 520 bags of 50kg rice worth N8,840,000 concealed with 50 bags of sugar worth N697,000 was intercepted along Mokwa axis of the command. He said: “It is worrisome that some Nigerians remain unrepentant even as they continue to lose their goods. Not even the Federal Government’s visible efforts in transforming the agricultural sector; especially in the area of rice production, has touched their conscience to avoid smuggling of rice.” The area controller said his officers and men were totally committed. According to him, the renewed strategy and proactive measures put in place in discovering new tactics of smugglers are yielding positive results. He said: “The command is set to key into Federal Government’s policies to encourage home-grown rice which will go a long way in creating employment opportunity to our teaming youths. “We appeal to the general public to always embrace legitimate means of livelihood and to avoid smuggling in all ramifications. “The eagle eye is all around Niger/Kogi Command to uncover and suppress the smuggling to the barest minimum in the interest of the economic prosperity and national development.”
