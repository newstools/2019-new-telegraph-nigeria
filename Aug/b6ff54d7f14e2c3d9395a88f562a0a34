The crisis rocking the Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE) worsened Tuesday when its President, Dansaaki S. Ade Agbede, voluntarily quit. Agbede made the announcement at the meeting of the Senior Elders’ Forum of the Council, which held at the Bodija, Ibadan residence of the first female Professor of Library Science in Africa, Adetoun Ogunseye. At the meeting presided over by the nonagenarian Professor, the centre appeared no longer holding any further with many elders of the group vowing not to have anything to do with its new leadership midwifed by Dr. Kindle Olajide, the suspended General Secretary of the YCE. It would be recalled that Dr.  Olajide, who was placed on an indefinite suspension by the Senior Elders Forum of the YCE had organised a meeting which was not sanctioned by the President where another President, Justice Ademola Bakre (rtd) was purportedly elected. To keep a firm hold on the group, Olajide then rushed to court to secure an injunction to stop another meeting scheduled by the Senior Elders’ Forum and put the National Secretariat of the Council under lock and key with chains on its gate to prevent access.
