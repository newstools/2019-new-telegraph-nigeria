Medical Women Association of Nigeria (MWAON) has offered free medical tests on hepatitis, blood pressure and diabetes for 200 women in Zamfara State with a view to alleviating difficulty in gaining access to health facilities mostly by women.  Explaining the essence of the outreach during the exercise in Gusau the state capital, the National President of the association, Dr. Fatimah Yalaraba Abdulqadir, stated that, despite MWAON is non-profit making association, they decided to embark upon the exercise being their medical contributions to women and children, though, men were partly recognised.  The President said: “Most of the times, women find it very difficult to visit health facilities for medical tests following their gender weakness and lack of awareness of their husbands on the importance of the tests; the reason we embarked on the programme as the presence of women in the exercise would ensure the success of the exercise. “We are actually here celebrating the Hepatitis day and we are getting people screened for hepatitis and diabetes, blood pressure as well, and the turnout is quite encouraging as the women and children have fully participated.”
