As Nigeria joined the rest of the world to mark the 2019 Breastfeeding Week, the Federal Government yesterday launched the National Zero Water Campaign, to improve the overall growth and development of children in the country. Launching the campaign in Abuja, the First Lady, Mrs. Aisha Buhari, noted that millions of such deaths could be prevented if mothers begin to embrace the practice of exclusive breastfeeding, which entailed not offering infants water during the first six months of life. While stressing that breastfeeding and the initiation of breastfeeding immediately after birth was the right of every new born baby, she explained that the first breast milk, which was colostrum, was highly nutritious as it contained antibodies that protect the new born from diseases. Aisha, who was represented by wife of the former governor of Nasarawa State, Dr. Mero Al-Makura, lamented that in Nigeria, â€˜non-breastfeeding comes with a huge cost, including the high rate of infant mortality due to childhood diseases like diarrhoea and pneumonia, resulting from the use of pre-lacteal feeds known to be potentially harmful to new born. She expressed optimism that the two-year campaign would push the exclusive breastfeeding rate to above 50 per cent, which was the global target, and specifically contribute to the health and well-being of the mother and child by helping in child spacing, contributing to reduced risk of ovarian and breast cancers.
