With barely a few weeks to the run up of her highly anticipated first concert, Nigerian R&B songstress, Waje, has released images from the set of her upcoming video ‘Udue’ featuring Johnny Drille, Mavin Records singer. The video also featured Emerald, Waje’s daughter, and was shot on location at the scenic Lufasi Park in Lagos state. ‘Udue’, a song off the singer’s ‘Red Velvet’ album, portrays Emerald as Drille’s love interest. The video follows the upbeat, soulful and seamless flow of the song which tells the story of a young couple in love.  The love-birds enjoy each other’s company close to nature, far away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Waje, one of Nigeria’s top female singers, had announced her Red Velvet Concert, a show which is said to be Nigeria’s first ‘Bedroom Musical’ and slated for September 1, 2019.
