The All Progressives Congress (APC) National Working Committee (NWC) has overruled its Appeal Panel for the Kogi State governorship aspirants, as it has disqualified the Director General, Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, Mr. Babatunde Irukera cleared by the Appeal Panel and cleared Alhaji Yahaya Audu disqualified by the Panel.
The supporters of Irukera, who stormed the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja Wednesday, demanded for an explaination from the NWC on Irukera’s disqualification.
Speaking, Alfa Amos, leader of the group, known as Kogi Mandate Group, said the NWC disqualified Irukera to pave way for the Kogi State governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello to win.
According to him, Irukera is the only aspirant that can defeat Bello in the primaries and if he is disqualified a repeat of Zamfara State would happen in Bayelsa.
Speaking, he queried: “Why will such a thing happen to Irukera?
“A sitting governor is aware that the only person that can unseat him is Babatunde Irukera and that is why he did all he could do to ensure that Babatunde did not feature in the primaries.
“We have a copy of the results from the screening and it was written boldly that Babatunde was cleared. Why won’t he be a participant in the primary? That is why we are here. Justice should be done and ensure that this party doesn’t lose Kogi State to a wrong hand. Babatunde is capable to handle Kogi State to the Next level.
“Let APC body as a whole do justice to ensure that Babatunde is allowed to feature in the primary.”
