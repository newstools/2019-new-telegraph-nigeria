A Kaduna High Court has this morning granted the Islamic Movement of Nigeria’s leader Ibrahim El-Zakzaky and his wife Zeenat permission to travel out of the country for medical attention. El-Zakzaky’s lawyer Femi Falana had filed a suit seeking his client’s release from detention since 2015 to treat his dimming sight and deteriorating health. Dairus Khobo, the presiding judge, had ordered that the IMN leader and his wife should be allowed to seek treatment abroad but that they should be accompanied by the officials of the Kaduna state government and personnel of the Department of State Security (DSS). It is believed that the IMN leader and his wife will be treated in India even though Iran is reported to have said they would be willing to handle El-Zakzaky’s medical case.
