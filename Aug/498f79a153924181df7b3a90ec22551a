The Chief Registrar of the Lagos State Judiciary, Mrs Taiwo Olatokun, yesterday, denied a report alleging that she urged an Ebute Metta Magistrate Court to deny bail to #RevolutionNow protesters, who were arraigned on Monday. Olatokun said that the report published on Monday by an online newspaper was untrue and could mislead the public. The Chief Registrar, in a statement, said that the six protesters arraigned by the police at the Magistrate Court were granted bail by Chief Magistrate A.O. Komolafe. According to the chief Registrar, all the defendants are now in the process of fulfilling their bail terms. She said: “The attention of the Lagos State Judiciary has been drawn to a news report in Sahara Reporters that the Chief Registrar has ordered Magistrates in the state not to grant bail to persons arraigned by police over Monday protest in Lagos. “We wish to state that there is no iota of truth in the report as no such instruction was given by the Chief Registrar. “We also wish to state that Magistrate Komolafe of Ebute Meta Magistrate Court in whose court some of the protesters were arraigned actually granted the defendants bail. “However, in line with generally known and established procedure, admission to bail by the court requires affected individuals to subsequently fulfill the conditions of bail for the bail to take full effect. “This is purely at the instance of the defendants after the court has done its part and in this particular case, the defendants are in the process of complying with the bail conditions. “We reiterate that there was no instruction from the Chief Registrar to refuse them bail and employ media organisations to always verify their report to avoid misleading the public”. It would be recalled that a lawyer and five other persons, who allegedly took part in the #RevolutionNow protests convened by the publisher of SaharaReporters, Omoyele Sowore, were charged before the court on Monday.
