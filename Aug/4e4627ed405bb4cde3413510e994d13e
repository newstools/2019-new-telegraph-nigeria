Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom and his estranged political godfather, Senator George Akume have again been embroiled in a battle for supremacy with the two politicians exchanging unpleasant words to each other. The recent trouble started at the reception organised in honour of the Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, Akume, where he (Akume) fired a diatribe at Ortom saying he singlehandedly made him (Ortom) governor in 2015 and not the Holy Spirit as the governor often claims. The utterances of the Minister, who was at the at the reception with the governorship candidate of the All  Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2019 polls, Emmanuel Jime, however, did not go down well with Ortom who insisted he was enthroned “by the Holy Spirit and not Akume”. According to the Minister: “I made Ortom governor; not the Holy Spirit”, Akume boasted at the reception. But in a furious reaction, Governor Ortom said this is not the first time the former governor would make what he called “such a blasphemous statement against his person”. “He had made a similar claim during the valedictory session of the 8th Senate,” Ortom said. The governor, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Terver Akase, described the utterances by Akume as “unfortunate”.
