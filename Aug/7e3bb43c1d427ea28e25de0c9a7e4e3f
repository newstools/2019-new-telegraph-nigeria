The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has once again expressed fears that Nigeria is collapsing under President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) government.
The party, which rose from its weekly National Working Committee (NWC) meeting on Wednesday, noted the escalating insecurity, rising political uncertainties, biting economic hardship as well as prevailing tension in all parts of the country.
PDP said in a statement after the meeting by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, that the nation, which was a prosperity hub and a reference point for democracy, personal freedom and good governance, now has all the trappings of a failed state.
It blamed this on the inability of President Buhari, to guarantee security of lives and property of Nigerians, regretting that the people now take their destinies in their hands.
“It is clear that the APC and the Buhari presidency have held Nigerians hostage.
“Nigerians are now being treated like a conquered people. They can no longer freely exercise their constitutionally guaranteed rights.
“Executive high-handedness have become a state policy just as the APC government, burdened by challenges of illegitimacy, has lost direction and only thriving in vindictiveness,” PDP noted.
