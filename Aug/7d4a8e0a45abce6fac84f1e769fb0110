As Nigerians prepare for this weekend’s Eid-el-Kabir celebrations, the Lagos State Government has prohibited  sales of rams in unauthorised places in the state, saying it is forbidden for any anyone to convert its roads, highway kerbs into ram markets or selling points. This was even  as the Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) charged the residents to be mindful of the environment by properly   disposing  their domestic wastes during and after the  celebrations. The government reminded Lagosians that the law against street trading was still in force, stressing that it would not tolerate any form of street trading which includes display of rams on major highways, road medians, lay-byes, gardens and parks  across the state. According to the government, it was not unusual for traders to take advantage of the season to market and sell rams, this must be done without defacing the state or compromising the wellness and wellbeing of Lagosians. The government, in statement issued by Assistant Director, Public Affairs of LAWMA, Mrs. Folashade Kadiri, assured that adequate measures had been put in place to ensure that the celebration was observed in a filth-free environment, as waste evacuators have been mandated to work round the clock to clean up the city.
