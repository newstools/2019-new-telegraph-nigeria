The younger sister of the First Lady of Delta state, Dame Edith, the wife of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, has been kidnapped by gunmen within Asaba, the state capital. The victim, Elizabeth, was allegedly accosted by a gang of five stern-looking young men, along the popular Anwai Road, near Temple Clinic Restaurant junction, a few metres from the Government House gate in Asaba. She was whisked away in a waiting vehicle. The victim, who is the immediate younger sister of the First Lady, was said to have been cruising round the metropolis in a black Jeep when the gang ambushed her. An eyewitness said the gang members were armed with dangerous weapons during the operation. The eyewitness added: “They shot sporadically into the air to scare people away. The lady was ordered to come out of her vehicle and moved into a waiting vehicle. The kidnappers zoomed off with her.” A top government functionary at the Government House in Asaba, said the incident has since thrown the Governor’s wife and her entire family into a panic. The Delta State Commissioner of Police, Adeyinka Adeleke, claimed ignorance, and denied any knowledge of such an abduction. The gang, however, had not opened discussion with the family.
