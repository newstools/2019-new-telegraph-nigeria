Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has thrown its weight behind Nigeria Innovation Summit (NIS). The Commission, in a statement, said its support for the Summit is in line with its commitment to promoting ICT innovation and investment opportunities and facilitating strategic collaboration and partnerships to grow the economy. According to the organisers, the collaborative Summit is a unique annual event that focuses on the need for the country, businesses, organisations, entrepreneurs to become more innovative and use innovation to drive sustainable development. “The Summit, which is open to participation and sponsorship by Federal and State Government Agencies, indigenous and international organisations and individuals, helps Nigeria embrace innovation and move in the direction of digital transformation through the use of Emerging Technologies and Trends, Research, Development, Commercialization, Entrepreneurship and Investments as the key drivers of an innovation ecosystem. This platform creates awareness on the need for Open Innovation in Nigeria, and challenges Nigeria to leverage innovation to become more competitive in the global economy,” the organisers said. Speaking on NCC’s partnership, the lead convener and Founder of Emerging Media, Kenneth Omeruo said, “we feel elated by NCC’s visionary approach in terms of supporting innovation in the country. Just recently, the Commission doled out millions of Naira to support Universities to conduct R&D. This is what the country needs, especially to lift the economy from the quagmires of yesteryears”. Confirmed speakers for the event include Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, EVC/CEO, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC); Obinnia Abajue, CEO, Hygeia HMO; Bruno Woeran, European Union Affairs Manager, Merinova Technology Centre (Finland); Tosin Faniro-Dada, Head, Startups (Lagos Innovates), Lagos State Employment Trust Fund; Prof Nii Quaynor, Africa Internet Pioneer, among others.
