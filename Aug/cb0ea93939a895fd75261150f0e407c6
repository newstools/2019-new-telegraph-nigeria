Ahead of this year’s Eid el Kabir, the Chief Administrator of the Lokoja Local Government Area, Hon. Mohammed Danasabe Mohammed, has commenced the reconstruction of the prayer ground.
The annual Muslim prayer ground along Felele Road in Lokoja, has been in existence for over a decade without any meaningful renovation work carried out on it.
But the present local government administration under Hon. Mohammed has deployed laborers to the site for the reconstruction of a befitting prayer ground before the festival on Sunday.
Part of the reconstruction includes building and roofing of a section where the Chief Imam and other top dignitaries sit to perform their annual worship.
Hon. Mohammed, who was at the project site on Wednesday, said the intention of his administration was to provide a conducive worship centre for Muslim brethren ahead of the coming Eid el Kabir.
