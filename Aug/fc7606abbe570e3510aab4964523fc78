Nigerian music star, Burna Boy, has stated his desire to give birth to a child with musician girlfriend, Steflon Don, in a way that is devoid of public attention.  Speaking during an interview with American broadcaster, Ebro, on radio show, Beats1, on Hot 97 FM, Burna Boy said: “It’s not the business part of us, it’s our life.   I’m trying to make it right because I don’t want to bring no kid into this life and everyone is disturbing the kid and looking or wondering what’s Steflon Don and Burna Boy’s kid doing.  I want to raise a kid the way I was raised.” The ‘Killin Dem’ singer described his relationship with the highly rated musician as great but added that he wants it to be part of his private life that is not in the public domain.   “It’s lovely (being with Steflon Don) I don’t know how to explain it. It’s just that I try to now kind of like keep it between us. I don’t want to be putting our thing out there in front of everybody anymore. Like you’d be there and you can see it but I don’t want to put it out there for everyone.”
