All is now set for the Federated Correspondents’ Chapel (FCC) forum, organised for governorship aspirants in Bayelsa State to tell Bayelsans what they intend to do if given the opportunity to lead the state.
This year’s edition is expected to kick off on Friday, at the secretariat of the Correspondents Chapel in Yenagoa.
The first to mount the podium and address correspondents of national dailies in the state is the three-time member representing the Ekeremor/Sagbama constituency at the Federal House of Representatives and governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Rt. Hon. Fred Agbedi.
A statement by the Chairman of FCC, Julius Osahon, said the forum will afford the aspirants the opportunity to tell Bayelsans their agenda as they seek election into Greek Haven as governor.
He said it will also afford journalists from national dailies in the state an opportunity to know their aspirants, ask questions on grey areas and keep the public well informed.
