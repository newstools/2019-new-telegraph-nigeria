T he price of smoked fish which has been stable at N3000 in recent months at Oyingbo Market has decreased by about 18 per cent to N2500 at Oyingbo Market, Lagos Mainland. The price rose to N3000 during 2018 Christmas and Yew Year festivities and had remained stable at that price ever since till this week when the price crashed by 18 per cent. Despite the harsh economic situation, Sunday Telegraph learnt on Friday that traders in the market were making brisk business as there was increase in patronage from housewives and restaurant operators who seemed excited by the reduction in the price of the very important soup condiment. Consumers and sellers spoken to by our correspondent disclosed that they are enjoying fall in price in many years since the Boko Haram insurgency commenced in the North East, which is the primary source of the variety of smoked fish mainly demanded by consumers. The consumers said during the third and fourth quarter of the year, the price of the fish normally comes down because there is normally high fishing activities at the Lake Chad. Meanwhile, at the Garage market, Mrs. Ime Elele, told Sunday Telegraph that the price of noodles has increased with a carton of Indomie (small size) formerly sold at N1700 now selling at N2100. She decried the rise in price, saying the money that would have easily bought fifteen cartoons can only buy eight cartons nowadays. She also decried low patronage where customers who normally buy in large quantities now buy in bits, a development she said has made the gains from such sales not enticing again.
