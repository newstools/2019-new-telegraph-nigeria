Pols (pix: Ajimobi/Makinde) The immediate past governor of Oyo State, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, Sunday cleared the air on the allegation that he and his aides stole the official vehicles allocated to them before the assumption of office of Governor Seyi Makinde, justifying that the officials paid for the vehicles based on decision taken by government.  Ajimobi said this in reaction to Makinde’s government’s allegation in the past weeks, while fielding questions from journalists after his Eid el Kabir prayer at the Ansar Ud Deen Praying Ground, Liberty Road, Oke Ado, Ibadan.  Noting that there were papers written on the sale of the vehicles to justify that they were not stolen, Ajimobi urged the incumbent administration to beam its searchlight on civil servants regarding those vehicles allegedly recently recovered from some mechanic workshops.  His words: “When you are in government, there are policies and decisions to be taken. We took the decision that anybody using vehicles at the time should take it away and pay. This is also practiced by the federal and other state governments.  “When I got to office, I didn’t see any vehicle. My brother, former Governor Adebayo Alao-Akala took his vehicles away and I did not talk. There are civil servants who steal whenever politicians are leaving government. Let them go and check those civil servants.”
