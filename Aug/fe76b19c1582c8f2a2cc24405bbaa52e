A suspected cult member, Biodun Adelokun, has been arrested on his way to attack a rival cultist at Ogijo area of Ogun State.  Adelokun, who confessed to being a member of Aiye confraternity, had allegedly wanted to eliminate a member of another cult group “earmarked for execution”.   He was, however, arrested by policemen attached to Ogijo Division in Sagamu Local Government Area.  The policemen were on routine patrol with the Divisional Police Officer (DPO), CSP Muhammed Baba.  The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the arrest of the suspected cultist in a statement yesterday.  Oyeyemi disclosed that a locally-made cut-to-size pistol, a live cartridge, an axe and assorted charms were recovered from the suspect.  The PPRO said other members of his gang fled on sighting policemen, adding that the Commissioner of Police, Bashir Makama, had ordered a massive manhunt to bring them to justice.  He said: “Men of Ogun State Police Command on 24th of July 2019 arrested Biodun Adelokun, a notorious Aiye cult member on his way to eliminate a member of rival cult member in Ogijo area of Ogun State.  “The suspect was arrested by policemen attached to Ogijo Division who were on routine patrol with the DPO, CSP Muhammed Baba.
