T he management of Remo Stars Sports Club has commenced the process of improving her Youth Development Section by affiliating with grassroots academics across the country.   In a bid to strengthen the youth development system of the club, it has decided to link up with grassroot clubs from South West, South East, South South, North West, North Central and North East areas of the geopolitical zones in Nigeria.   The Youth System started back in year 2016 with a Pan Nigeria Youth Tournament hosted by Remo Stars at the Otunba Dipo Dina Stadium in Ijebu Ode, Ogun State and many from that event have found themselves outside the shores of the country with CD Feirense in Portugal, FC Lori in Armenia, Fremad Amager in Denmark and the likes.   In a statement signed by the club Secretary, Michael Onikute, it was revealed that the affiliation is in line to help promote the young bloods into full-fledged professional that will be a household name in the nearest future.   “We are actually looking at getting affiliated to 20 grassroots academics across the country with dedicated youth players and we might eventually jump the figure up in the nearest future because the club has a great project for the youths,” Onikute said.   “We actually believe that it is the best way to take the youth out of the street at the early stage of their career and help them plan a better future for themselves and their families, even for the country as a whole.   “The academy will train them and also assist them plan their future. That was why we started receiving entries from different grassroots academics since Sunday August 11, and it will end on the 19th.”
