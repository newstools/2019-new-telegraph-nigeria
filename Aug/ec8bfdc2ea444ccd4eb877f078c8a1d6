Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has dismissed the report that the state government demolished a Mosque in Port Harcourt, describing the report as the handiwork of mischief makers to create disaffection in the state. The governor, who spoke yesterday at Biambo Street, Off School Road by Mami Market Junction, near Rainbow Estate, Port Harcourt, said there was no Mosque on ground, and hence nothing or structure was demolished. Wike said that it was unfortunate that mischief makers would go to the extent of circulating false information, adding that some prominent Nigerians have called him over the report. He said: “I received calls from several prominent Nigerians on the fake news being circulated online. I have come here with reporters and you can all see there is no Mosque here. “It is most unfortunate that fickle minded persons will claim that a Mosque was demolished at this place, when no Mosque existed here. The story was concocted by mischief makers.” Wike further explained that some people started erecting illegal foundation at the disputed land, even though they had no approval to embark on any construction work. “They came here to erect illegal structure. There was no approval from the state government for any structure to be erected here,” the governor added, saying: “The people, who started the foundation, had already dragged the state government to court on the disputed land. The Rivers State Government won the case. What they attempted to do was to start the illegal construction to tie the hands of the state government.” He, therefore, urged the Muslim community in the state to come out and show him where a Mosque was demolished in the state, while advising them not to allow themselves to be used by politicians to peddle false stories against the state government. Wike said that the state government operated within the rule of law, saying that the state government would not be distracted by the illegal circulation of fake reports.
