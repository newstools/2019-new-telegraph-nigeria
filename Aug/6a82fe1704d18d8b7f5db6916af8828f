Flood, accompanying downpour, yesterday swept away a three-year-old, identified as Tavershima, in Makurdi, Benue State. The rain, which started about 2a.m., lasted for over four hours, causing flooding in areas like Agber village, Wurukum Market, Wadata rice mill, Idye village, Gyado Villa, Logo 2, Pever Agena Street and parts of Low Level. At Wurukum Market, traders were bailing out water from their shops when our correspondent visited, while others, who lost some of their wares, were weeping profusely. A trader, who sells mobile phone parts, and his counterpart, who deals in building materials, said they have lost their wares to the flood. “It is unfortunate that this has happened, I didn’t expect that it will rain like this. I have lost most of my things in my store to the flood. Since I came, you can see I have been bailing out water and up till now more water is coming,” one of the traders said. Another victim of the disaster, Mrs. Rose Adekwagh, said most of her household items, including foodstuff, were swept away in the flood and appealed to spirited individuals to come to her aid. Meanwhile, there was anguish at the residence of Mr. Tartenger popularly known as Orkuda over the loss of his three-year-old son, Tavershima. It was learnt that Orkuda and his wife, whose house had been submerged in water, decided to take the children to a neighbour’s pavement for them to evacuate their household items. Witnesses said when they returned, Tavershima, who was asked to stand on the corridor of the neighbour, was no longer seen. The boy’s body was discovered a few metres away from the house. The parents, who wept uncontrollably while searching for their son, lamented that they lost a child a few years ago in a similar incident.
