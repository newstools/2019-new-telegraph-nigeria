Security forces in Nigeria’s commercial hub, Lagos, are teargasing and arresting #RevolutionNow protesters. Officers are targeting those who had gathered at the Lagos National Stadium, where they have erected barricades preventing them from entering the venue. One of the key demands of Revolution Now protest is a call for an end to insecurity in the country, where kidnappings for ransom are rampant, reports the BBC. There had been plans to hold demonstrations countrywide, organised by pro-democracy campaigner Omoyele Sowore, who was arrested over the weekend for “calling for an overthrow of the Nigerian government”.
