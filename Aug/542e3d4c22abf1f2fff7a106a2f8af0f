A Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), Polished Pillars Foundation, has held its annual Teenagers Summer Retreat (TEESURE 2019) to celebrate its 10th year anniversary at Dansol High School, Acme Road, Ikeja, Lagos. The group focuses on building exemplary leaders in youths especially young teenagers between ages 10 and 21 years by integrating them with the GOVEX example: Godliness, Virtue & Excellence.  With the theme: ‘Purposeful Living: Its relevance to Teenagers’, the event had in attendance over 300 teenagers from different parts of Nigeria. The President of Polished Pillars Foundation, Dr. Mrs. Chioma Emma-Nwanchukwu, is passionate about the teenagers’ living purposefully. She said: “When you are living purposefully, life just flows.  Like flowing water, you effortlessly adapt and rise above any obstacle, which is placed in your path. You carve out your own path for life as you pass peacefully through. We are thankful to God for the 10th-year anniversary of the organisation. It gladdens my heart that some of the teenagers having forged ahead in life over the years had become professionals in the various field of life. “Our organisation is determined to help our teens to begin their path to find purpose by building up key qualities in them.”  This year’s seminar had several breakout parallel sessions to discuss on Self Esteem/Self-love, Impactful studying, Social Mediathe purposeful teen’s perspective, developing your skills, depression & purposeful living.
