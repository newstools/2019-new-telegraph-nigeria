The member of the Federal House of Representative representing Sagbama/Ekeremor Federal Constituency and one of the aspirants in November’s Bayelsa State gubernatorial election under the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Fred Agbedi at the weekend disclosed that the purported presentation of preferred aspirants by Governor Henry Seriake Dickson on the platform of the Restoration Caucus was an error. He said it was not a collective decision by all members of the present restoration administration in the state.   Agbedi, who also served as two-time Director-General of Governor Seriake Dickson Campaign Organisation, described as a ‘fairy tale’, the decision by the governor to present three persons as his preferred aspirants for the governorship ticket of the PDP in the state.   Agbedi, who led members of his Onward Restoration and   Transformation Campaign Organisation Friday to the Secretariat of the Federated Correspondents’ Chapel of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) in Yenagoa, said the nomination of the preferred governorship aspirants was done without a meeting among members of the Restoration Team.   According to Agbedi: “There was no Restoration meeting to decide the issue of preferred aspirants. After Governor Dickson in the Restoration Team, I am the next person. And any meeting I don’t attend as a key anchor of restoration, did not hold. “That was why we named our campaign team as ‘Onward Restoration Organisation’.   “This is Restoration itself. Go and check all others who claimed to be restoration members. Go and check their slogans. You will not find anything restoration.   “I beat my chest to say it. You cannot become governor when you have abandoned restoration. Is that the way to go? That is why we are onward Restoration Campaign organisation.”
