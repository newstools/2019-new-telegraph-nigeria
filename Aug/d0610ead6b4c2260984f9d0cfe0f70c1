Mega airline, Emirates, has again denied that it increased scheduled flight services to Abuja or Lagos. The airline was reacting to the condemnation by Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON), the umbrella body for Nigerian airlines, over alleged granting of additional frequency to Emirates. Chairman of AON, Capt. Noggie Meggison, had called on the Federal Government to review all existing Bilateral Air Services Agreements (BASA) to readdress the unfair trade advantage given to foreign airlines against Nigerian airlines. The management of Emirates denied AON’s position. It said: “We only operated extra flights to Abuja and Lagos for a very limited period, for the sole purpose of serving Nigerian pilgrims travelling to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for Hajj. “Some detractors like to claim that Emirates receives government subsidies and therefore represent unfair competition. But these allegations are patently false and we have repeatedly debunked these myths over the years.”
