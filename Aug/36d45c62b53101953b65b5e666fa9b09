A rush into the safety of U.S. government bonds smothered a broad rally in global stocks Wednesday, as spiraling fears of a global economic recession gripped markets. According to Reuters News, yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell to their lowest levels since October 2016, and gold soared to a six-year high, while riskier assets such as stocks and oil prices nosedived. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened more than 500 points lower, helping erase earlier gains in European shares. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.57 per cent. “Bonds are being bought in a panic mode,” said Andrew Brenner, managing director at National Alliance Capital Markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 365.11 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 25,664.41, the S&P 500 lost 31.36 points, or 1.09 per cent, to 2,850.41 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 62.56 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 7,770.71.The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.39 per cent. U.S. shares had gained overnight after President Donald Trump downplayed worries of a lengthy trade war and senior adviser Larry Kudlow said Trump’s administration is planning to host a Chinese delegation for talks in September. Wall Street futures gauges also rose. The U.S. administration’s remarks marked a shift in tone from recent days, when Beijing warned that Washington’s labeling China as a currency manipulator would have severe consequences for the global financial order. The U.S. move rattled financial markets and dimmed hopes the trade war was ending. Since then, China’s state banks have been active in the onshore yuan forwards market, tightening dollar supply and supporting the Chinese currency, sources told Reuters. Despite that support, the yuan still dropped 0.2 per cent to 7.0708 in offshore markets, with currency markets still on edge after the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) set its official reference rate at an 11-year low. “We had a little bit of recovery yesterday, but this morning we are seeing that stalling due to the PBOC fixing the dollar-yen higher again,” said Thu Lan Nguyen, FX strategist at Commerzbank. The skittish mood was underlined by continuing demand for currencies and commodities considered safe havens. Gold touched a six-year high of $1,489.76 per ounce. The Japanese yen rose 0.2 per cent to 106.26, although that was still some way from levels seen on Monday when the trade war’s escalation panicked investors.
