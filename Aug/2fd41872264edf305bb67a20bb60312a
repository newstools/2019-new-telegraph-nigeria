Prince Charles has been invited to star in the new James Bond film, The Sun on Sunday can reveal. The heir to the throne was asked if he would take a cameo role when he visited the film set just a few weeks ago and met 007 star Daniel Craig. Charles, 70, would follow in the foosteps of his mother The Queen, now 93, who played a starring role in Danny Boyle’s homage to the movie for the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London. This saw Bond, played by Craig, heading to Buckingham Palace to collect her Majesty. They then took a helicopter to the Olympic Park before a stunt double made to look like the Queen dramatically parachuted to the ground. Princes Wills and Harry also had a cameo as Stormtroopers in Star Wars: The Last Jedi in 2017 although they were cut from the final footage for being too tall. A source close to the production team told us: “They loved the buzz around the Queen’s appearance alongside Daniel Craig and think Charles could top even that. He is the epitome of everything British, perfect for a cameo role and Bond fans worldwide would absolutely love it. “When he visited the film set a few weeks ago it was discussed. Now he is considering it.”Charles’ involvement would provide a massive boost to the “cursed” flick, which has been riddled with accidents including Craig injuring his ankle. A source revealed: “The producers are desperate to sign him. “It is no secret that the film has suffered a number of setbacks but landing a Royal could be just what the movie needs.” The flick dubbed ‘Bond 25’ features the usual cast of glamorous girls including Cuban actress Ana de Armas, 31, but has been plagued with issues since filming began earlier this year. An explosion at Pinewood Studios destroyed part of the sound stage roof in June and caused a minor injury to a crew member. * Courtesy: thesun.co.uk
