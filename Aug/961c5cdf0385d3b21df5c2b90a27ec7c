Following the incessant incidences of robbery recorded in female hostels of the University of Ibadan, authorities of the institution on Tuesday imposed a partial curfew on the campus as a means of checkmating the scourge.   According to the decision taken at a meeting of the universityâ€™s Security Committee, which reviewed the current security situation on the campus, the partial curfew, which takes effect from tomorrow, is between 12 midnight and 5am.   A release signed by the Vice Chancellor, Professor Idowu Olayinka, indicated that all students and members of staff must have means of identification whenever they are asked by security operatives. Aside this, the management said that all male visitors to the three female hostels (Awolowo Hall, Queen Idia Hall and Elizabeth hall) are to be received outside the halls, while female guests will be screened.   Olayinka added that any male visitors seen loitering around female halls beyond 8:30pm will be taken as a suspect.   Recall that two female hostels at the university had been invaded by thieves who robbed and injured both male and female students in the process.
