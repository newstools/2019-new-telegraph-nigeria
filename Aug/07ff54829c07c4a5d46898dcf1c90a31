A non-governmental organisation, Social Integrity Network (SIN), has tasked the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, to urgently set up a committee to investigate the cancellation of preshipment inspection by Nigeria Customs Service. The group made this call yesterday, at a press briefing in Abuja, to further reinforce its positions in a Press conference it held in Kaduna of Tuesday. Pre-shipment inspection was said to have been cancelled by the Nigeria Customs Service during the tenure of former Comptroller- General of Customs, Alhaji Dikko Inde. The groupâ€™s Spokesperson, Mallam Ibrahim Issa, while addressing journalists, said that if the Federal Government was serious in tackling insurgency in the country, it must revisit the issue of pre-shipment inspection with a view to reversing the cancellation. He noted that the call by the group for the National Assembly to look into the matter became necessary because all manner of weapons were usually brought into the country illegally without inspection.
