Scientists have created a spread that is made almost entirely of water, in an attempt to make a healthier alternative to butter.
The spread is derived from 80 per cent water and 20 per cent fat, while real butter is made of 80 per cent fat – and has no artificial ingredients.
A tablespoon of the fake ‘butter’ contains a quarter of the fat (2.8g) and calories (25.2) of the real thing, barely touching daily dietary guidelines.
The scientists have not said when the spread would be available, or what it tastes like, but previous ‘healthy’ butters have left customers disappointed.
However, the team said how it was created gives the fake spread the ‘consistency of butter’, as well as having a similar ‘creaminess’.
Government officials have ruled that people cut down on butter because it contains saturated fat, which is bad for heart health, reports dailymail.co.uk.
However, there is evidence saturated fat – also abundant in cheese and red meats – is good for health, too.
Food scientists at Cornell University are behind the low-calorie spread, and shared its creation in a paper published in the journal Applied Materials and Interfaces.
