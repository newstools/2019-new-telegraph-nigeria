No fewer than 52 pharmacies, patent medicine shops and unlicensed premises at Isolo, Egbeda, Ikotun, Bariga and Somolu in Oshodi-Isolo, Alimosho and Somolu Local government areas of Lagos have been sealed. These were contained in a statement from the Director, Public Affairs, Ministry of Health in Lagos, Tunbosun Ogunbanwo. According to the statement, Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Ministry of Health, Dr. Titilayo Goncalves, said the drug premises were sealed by the Lagos State Taskforce on Counterfeit, Fake Drugs and Unwholesome Processed Foods on Wednesday for offences bordering on illegal operation, operating beyond scope, amongst others. Goncalves, who disclosed this yesterday when she received a report of the operation by the Task Force explained that the affected pharmacies and patent medicine shops allegedly indulged in the practice of operating without license, engaging unqualified persons to man and dispense drugs to unsuspecting residents, operating beyond scope through sale of ethical products and displaying and storing drugs in unconducive environments, which compromised potency and integrity of the drugs rendering them ineffective. She said: “Although some of the pharmacies visited were registered, it is disheartening to note that quite a number of them had no qualified pharmacists on duty and displayed expired drugs for sale to the public. “The sealing of the affected pharmacies and patent medicine stores was in accordance with the provisions of Section C34 of the Counterfeit, Fake Drugs and Unwholesome Processed Foods Miscellaneous Provision Act of 1999, No. 25. “The law prohibits dispensing and wholesaling of drugs by patent medicine vendors.”
