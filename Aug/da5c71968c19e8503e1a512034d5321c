Nigeria Customs Service (NCS)’s Federal Operations Unit, (FOU), Zone A, Ikeja, has intercepted 4,208 bags of smuggled foreign rice concealed with tubers of yam, cassava, animal feed and bottle of alcoholic products. The seizure is valued at N55million. Other seizures are banned drugs seized within Lagos, Oyo and Ogun states The Customs Area Controller of the unit, Comptroller Muhammed Aliyu explained yesterday in Lagos that the total seizures were valued at N85million. He explained that the contrabands were seized when the smugglers were rerouting them from Oyo State to Lagos. Aliyu noted: “Due to the joint security operation at the land borders in the country, Operation Joint Swift, smugglers now find it difficult to smuggle rice into the country.  Hence, they are moving the one already stored into the country. There are some bags of rice stored in villages and the smugglers are bringing them out one by one because of the joint security operation at the border. We see them concealing contrabands with poisonous substances such as soap, animal feeds and even alcoholic drinks.” He explained that some 3,888 sachets of bisoprolol Fumarate, 300 bottles of Lactulose, 600 sachets of Atorastattin, 2,000 bottles of mandanol nasal drop and 10,800 sachets of Furossamide were seized from the smugglers. Others are 279 Dihydrocodeine, 744 Kenalog 40mg injection, 300 cartons of Lansoptazol, 560 sachets clopidogre, 1,764 contiflo and 320 sachets meloxicam among others. The comptroller advised corporate organisations to install trackers on their vehicles in order to forestall unscrupulous drivers from using the branded vehicles for rice smuggling. Aliyu  noted that smuggling activities have reduced drastically. His words: “The smuggled rice, drugs are not coming from the land border. But within a week, the unit has intercepted 4,208 bags. This is to show you that the rice smuggling is going down due to the activities at the borders.”
