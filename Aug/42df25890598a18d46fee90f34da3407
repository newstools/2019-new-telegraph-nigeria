T he Vice Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Peter Obi has not been denied a visa by any embassy in Nigeria. This was disclosed in a statement by his Media Adviser, Mr. Valentine Obienyem.   Obienyem, who was reacting to reports to that effect on social media, said that the irony of the falsehood was that Obi was presently in the USA on the invitation of highly-placed officials who were supposed to have denied him the said visa. “Obi is a good brand such that organisations and countries are satisfied to associate with him because he has proven to be a highly responsible person/politician.   Those peddling the rumour are the same people that are exasperated by the honour coming his way and are desperately trying to associate his name with one crime or untoward action not purely out of hate, but out of the desire to prove that he is after all human and can sin a little. Regrettably for them, Obi will not be caught in the web of their wickedness and intrigues because he is simply living his life without pretences,” Obienyem said.   Obienyem, who wondered why anybody should think in terms of his boss being denied visa, asked if it could probably be because of his superlative performance in Anambra State, which saw him leaving N75billion in the treasury for his successor, building a teaching hospital from the scratch and paying over N37billion in arrears of pension and gratuities since 1999 among others.   Obienyem advised those peddling such news to save themselves from what he called “psychic encumbrances”, by desisting from chasing shadows and facing edifying acts wherever they are.
