 I f you are new to wine, you probably have many questions. You may wonder the difference between red and white wine, how itâ€™s made, or even the difference in flavour. We offer you a brief guide on red wine versus white wine.   Colour  In the simplest of terms, red wines are made with red grapes, and white wines are made with green grapes. However, the difference in the two stems from what are called tannins. Tannins are a component of the grape found in the skin and seeds of the grapes. During the fermentation process, the entire grapes, including the seeds and stems are used to make red wines, which cause its red colour. White wines, however, only use the juice from the grape in the fermentation process.   Alcohol content  Red wines have higher alcohol content than white wines. The reason for the difference is the time the grapes are harvested. The grapes for red wines are picked at higher ripeness than white grapes. As a result, the higher sugar content in red wines tends to have higher alcohol content.   Flavour   Red wines are full-bodied wines with a richer flavour profile. Their flavours range from fruity to meaty, and they can even have a spicy taste. White wines, on the other hand, are simpler in taste. They typically have a lighter or more floral taste and will often have undertones of citrus.   Although there are some differences between red and white wines, they are both enjoyable and offer many flavourful options to choose from.
