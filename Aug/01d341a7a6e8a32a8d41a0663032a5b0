 The Urhobos of Delta South Senatorial District made up of Agbarha, Okere Urhobo Kingdoms of Warri South and Patani local government areas have said that they are entitled to all rights and privileges accruing to the indigenes of the Senatorial District including appointment into the Board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). While stressing that they are indigenous Urhobos in Warri, who are made of Agbarha and Okere Urhobo Kingdoms with their two traditional rulers, with six Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) delineated wards in the locality and privileges like their counterparts of Ijaw, Itsekiri and Isoko, they added that it was ‘misleading and mischievous’ for a faceless group in Delta South All Progressives Congress (APC), to say that Delta South Senatorial District is made up of only Ijaws, Isoko and Itsekiri. In a press statement signed by Mudiaga Enaife, Faith Isiavwe, Grace Owhofa and Ufuoma Ukpebitere for and on behalf of the All Progressive Congress (APC) members and Indigenes of Okere Urhobo Kingdom and Agbarha Kingdom of Warri and made available to journalists, they said the group had the sole aim trying to create the false impression that they were only three tribes in the Senatorial District. The aggrieved APC members went into memory lane to defend their position by disclosing that when Dr Emmanuel Uduaghan, an Itsekiri man from Delta South Senatorial District, was Governor of Delta State, he nominated his Itsekiri brothers in the persons of Engr. Omasuli Tuoyo as Executive Director Projects EDP, NDDC and Mr Val Areyenka as NDDC Commissioner representing Delta State in the Board of NDDC “and there were no protests”. They therefore contended that both Urhobos of Agbarha and Okere Kingdom in Warri South, including the Urhobos in Patani Local Government Area, are entitled to any federal appointment like their brothers and sisters from the Ijaw, Isoko and Itsekiri ethnic nationalities since they are all from Delta South Senatorial District
