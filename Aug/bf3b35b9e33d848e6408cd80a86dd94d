Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State yesterday ordered the immediate suspension of the Medical Director, Dr. Audu Usman, of the Umaru Shehu Ultra-Modern Hospital, Maiduguri, and four doctors who were absent while they were supposed to be on call. The governor had on Monday visited the Umaru Shehu Ultra-Modern Hospital and the State Specialist Hospital from midnight to 2a.m. during which he discovered that none of the 19 resident doctors, including the two on call, were available to look after patients. Zulum had instructed nurses to call the doctors on the phone during his visit but none responded. “Governor Zulum has ordered the suspension of the Medical Director of Umaru Shehu Hospital, Dr. Audu Usman, for his failure of leadership. Furthermore,  Dr. Musa Chuwang and Dr. Chijioke Ibemere, who absented themselves while on call, have also been suspended while Dr. Baba Ali Malgwi who was second on call is suspended arising from his inability to respond to telephone calls during the governor’s visit. At the same time, frantic attempt to reach him was impossible even when he lives within the doctors’ quarters located around the hospital. “Similarly, Dr. Esther of the Paediatric Department, who was supposed to be on duty, was found absent and hence, she is also suspended. All medical doctors attached to the Accident and Emergency Unit are to be queried for their absence and the lack of duty roaster. Chief Medical Director of the Borno State Hospitals Management Board is directed to comply with the governor’s directive while he is to take measures that should ensure all gaps are filled,” the government said in a statement. It added that Zulum was determined to ensure that all hospitals across Borno State provided adequate healthcare delivery at all times.
