Police yesterday stormed the Kwara State Stadium Complex in Ilorin to disperse athletes training. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Ajayi Okasanmi, said the action was a proactive measure against breakdown of law expected due to the #RevolutionNow protest. The police also arrested and kept incommunicado the Cross River State correspondent of The Nation newspaper, Mr. Nicholas Kalu, for covering the RevolutionNow protest in Calabar. Sporting activities in the stadium complex, located in the Ilorin metropolis, were disrupted as the law enforcement agents turned back athletes who had arrived the stadium for training. Many of the athletes, who were stranded around the stadium gate on the popular Ibrahim Taiwo Road, wondered why sportsmen and women would be denied access to facilities in the stadium for training. It was learnt that the police were ordered to block the stadium gate over the speculation that the facility had been picked as meeting point for the RevolutionNow rally organised by the presidential candidate of African Action Congress (AAC) in the 2019 general election, Omoyele Sowore. The PPRO, Okasanmi, said that the presence of policemen at the stadium was to prevent chaos. He said: “Kwara State is largely recognised as a state of harmony and Ilorin is reputed to be peaceful. We owe our law-abiding people the duty to sustain that. More so, we had to prevent the planned protest from being hijacked by hoodlums in order not to lead to any dangerous dimension.”
