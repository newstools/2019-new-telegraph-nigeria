The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)  has been intervening in the currency market over the past two weeks to keep the naira stable as foreign investors took profits after yields fell on the local debt market, Reuters reported a forex trader as saying yesterday. The naira was quoted at 362.80 to the dollar on the currency market at the Investors and Exporters (I&E) forex window, weaker than the level around 361 level where it has traded for much of this year, said the dealer, who trades currency for the local unit of an international bank. According to the news agency, pressure has been building on the naira amid a dwindling supply of dollars. It now takes more than a week to fill customer orders. “We are currently seeing more outflow than inflow, but the central bank has been intervening,” the trader said. “The moment the central bank doesn’t provide support, people may start to panic.” The CBN has cut back on open market auctions to attract foreign investors in its bonds, a policy shift aimed at stimulating lending to boost an economy stuck with low growth after a recent recession. The apex bank auctioned a one-year open-market bill last month at around 12 per cent, down from as high as 18 per cent a year ago. The trader said some offshore clients were taking profits and that summer holidays in Europe could also account for the low volumes. If local rates were much higher, I don’t think we would have seen much outflows.”
