Steve Uzoechi, Owerri  Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers have abducted Mrs. Anuri Maduwuike, wife of the Anglican Bishop of Ikeduru Diocese, Emmanuel Maduwuike. Mrs Maduwuike was said to have been abducted Thursday afternoon, on her way home from Owerri. Our correspondent learnt that the prelate’s wife was blocked off the road along the bad stretch of road at Ekemele, by gunmen operating in an unmarked vehicle. She was then bundled into the assailants’ vehicle and driven away to an unknown destination. A lawyer and media practitioner, Mr. Emperror Iwuala, who is also an adherent of the Anglican Church, posted the incident on his Facebook page calling for prayers. His post read: “Wife of the Anglican bishop of Ikeduru Diocese, Mrs. Anuri Maduwuike was kidnapped yesterday (Thursday) by unknown gunmen. We need prayers for God’s intervention and for the safety and freedom of God’s handmaid.” The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Orlando Ikeokwu, confirmed the development when contacted. The police spokesman, however, added that her abductors were yet to establish contacts with the victim’s family.
