The Reformed Niger Delta Avengers (RNDA) in conjunction with nine other militant groups has warned some groups it called ‘shaddy’ minded persons to stop protesting against the Amnesty coordinator Charles Dokubo  calling for his removal from the Amnesty office  to desist  forthwith  or it will declare war against them.
The coordinator  of the group, Major General Johnmark Ezon-Ebi a.k.a Obama, in a statement made available to New Telegraph, said  the evil plot of those elements have been unveiled adding that  if they didn’t desist, RNDA will declare them enemies of the region.
RNDA commended Dokubo for his sterling leadership qualities and for putting up some proper structures on ground to reform and re-organise the Amnesty office.
“We strongly believe that your appointment is a right step in the right direction as a renowned conflict resolution expert, a technocrat and a true son from the Niger Delta region.
“The fake purported story surrounding the Amnesty office could lead to another uprising in the region if not properly checked. It could destroy the relative peace that is existing in the creeks.
“We therefore call on  the Federal Government to discountenance such fake allegations because they are all lies doctored by some group of self-acclaimed mis- guarded corrupt minded persons parading themselves as Niger Delta leaders based in Abuja metropolis who are clamouring to take over from the Amnesty boss, ” RNDA said.
