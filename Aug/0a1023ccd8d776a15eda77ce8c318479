Wife of the Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, Betty Anyawun Akeredolu, yesterday challenged women and girl-child to obtain skills that would enable them to defend themselves against molestation by the male folks. Also, Mrs. Akeredolu said women should not limit themselves to status provided for them by culture, tradition, religion, and society but to challenge the status-quo which prevented their growth. Speaking at the opening ceremony of 2019 BEMORE Summer Boot Camp, Mrs. Akeredolu said the rate at which women were being raped and defiled by their male counterpart was worrisome and something must be done to prevent the menace. She said:  “The captains of the ship seem to have taken their hands off the wheel. We are left bare, exposed and without protection, we thought we had. Wolves in the wilderness, the hyenas, they come at us from all angles, it keeps getting worse, they keep coming and no one says nothing. “The girl folk is being hunted, in every way we are hunted. First, we should not speak; we must not stand eyeball to eyeball with the men. And now, we are here being molested as though we are lesser beings. But we know what we have to do to protect ourselves; we know where we have to stand to have our voices heard.”
