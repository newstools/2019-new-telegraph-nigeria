Kinsmen of Head of Nursing Services (HNS) of the Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital, (FNH), Enugu, Dr. (Mrs.) Maria Amadi, have raised the alarm over an alleged shoddiness in the investigation and trial of suspected killers of the late nurse. Besides, Amadi’s kinsmen, under the umbrella of Aku General Assembly (AGA) in Igbo-Etiti local government area of Enugu state, yesterday petitioned the Inspector General of Police, Adamu Muhammad, accusing some police officers of cover-up and meddling  in the investigation of the suspected killers, who were standing trial before the Chief Judge of Enugu State, Justice Priscilla Emehelu. Amadi was allegedly assassinated in front of her house at 38, Enugu Ezike Street, Federal Housing Trans-Ekulu, Enugu on 21st March, 2019 while she was returning from work. Addressing journalists in Enugu on the matter, the AGA President General, Chief Fidelis Ezeonyili, mentioned names of some police officers, who were bent on scuttling material evidence to subvert the cause of justice. Dissatisfied, the Enugu State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Ebere Amaraizu, a Superintendent of Police (SP) denied the allegations against police officers insisting that even while trial was on, investigations were still being carried out.
