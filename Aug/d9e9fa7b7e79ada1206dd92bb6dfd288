The Nigerian Army has said that its troops repelled attacks on Gubio and Magumeri communities in Borno State on Wednesday, by suspected Boko Haram elements.
There were unconfirmed reports that the terrorist elements may have held some grounds, after the fierce attacks.
But, spokesman for the 7 Division, Col. Ado Isa, maintained that troops deployed in the area foiled the attack, which he said was planned to enable the fighters loot foodstuffs from shops in markets.
While notng that there were no casualties on troops’ side, he, however, disclosed that a member of the local vigilante lost his life.
“The attention of the Nigerian Army in the Theatre of Operation Lafiya Dole has been drawn to reports on various media platforms indicating attack on Gubio and Magumeri communities in Borno State at about 1735hrs of Wednesday the 21st of August, 2019.
“To avoid further misinformation that could create unnecessary tension, the Theatre Command wishes to state that the attack was targeted at Nigerian Army troops deployed in the areas to enable the terrorists gain access shops in the market in the towns to loot food items and other logistics. The attack was, however, repelled by the troops,” he said in the statement released to the media.
