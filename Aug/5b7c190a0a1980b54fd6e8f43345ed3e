Plateau State Government on Tuesday raised an alarm over the growing trend of cultism and gang violence in 14 communities of Jos North Local Government Area of the state.  Director General, Plateau Peace Building Agency (PPBA), Mr Joseph Lengmang in a press statement signed and issue to journalists in Jos, said the cases of cult activities and gang violence appears to be on the rise within the Jos metropolis and environs.  “Gangsterism and cult violence in Apata, Busa Buji, Alheri, Gada Biu, Congo Russia, Angwan Damisa, Angwan rogo, Angwan Suya, Rukuba road, Dilimi, Nasarawa Gwom, Gangare, Utan and a host of other area is as random as the way destructive wind gusts are random.You can brace yourself but still not anticipate the location or severity of the attacks and violence,” he said.  According to the statement, some neighborhoods are now forced to retire into their homes as early as 7pm for fear of attacks, or even caught in the middle of cult and Sara-Suka wars.  “Reports indicate that gang violence and cultist activities have culminated into acts of revenge that are growing more heinous by the day. Bullets have been shot, throats slit open and young boys hacked down with machetes in their prime,” it added.  The statement added that some of the neighborhoods have also been identified with high rates of the consumption and peddling of illicit drugs.
