ISIS has claimed responsibility for a suicide attack at a wedding party in Kabul. The bomb blast killed at least 63 people and injured another 182 in the Afghan capital on Saturday night. The venue was packed with party-goers and children when the terrifying attack was unleashed. Pictures posted on social media showed bodies strewn amid overturned table and chairs at the wedding hall. The bomber struck the men’s reception area, officials said. “Everybody was running,” a waiter at the hall, Sayed Agha Shah, said after the blast. “Several of our waiters were killed and wounded.” The attack came as the Taliban and the United States are trying to negotiate an agreement on the withdrawal of U.S. forces in exchange for a Taliban commitment on security and peace talks with Afghanistan’s U.S.-backed government. It follows a bomb attack on a mosque in Pakistan on Friday that killed a brother of Taliban leader Haibatullah Akhundzada, reports metro.co.uk.
