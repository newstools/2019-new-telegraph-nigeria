A Nigerian fashion entrepreneur, Toyin Lawani, says she demands for N2million before making out time to go on dates with men who indicate interest in her. Lawani, 37, made this statement while discussing her “high taste” when it comes to relationships explaining that her demands help her save time that would have been wasted on broke guys.“I said I was officially single. It doesn’t mean I’m officially stupid. My taste is extremely high. You must pay 2million naira to my account before I go on a date with you. So if you are ugly I can Japaaa quickly and won’t be upset with myself,” she wrote on Instagram. “I left my work where I get my bread to make time for you. The time that I will use to get dressed and even do makeup is the same time that I will use to make money, run my many businesses, and attend to my amazing clients. “Before, they used to say love is blind. Now love should choose wisely because men are very deceitful. You will date a guy who doesn’t give you money, you will support him and he will still mess you up. “So it’s best you are comfortable while they do their cheating. Haven’t dated in a while, so it’s best I start putting what I want out there. I might be loud on social media because it’s a fun place but love to keep my relationship extremely private.” Lawani, who has a company and fashion academy to her name, is born to Olanrewaju Lawani, a politician from Ekiti state who worked with Gowon during his days. She began her career at 16 and has since built her career as a stylist She has worked with numerous celebrities in the Nigerian entertainment industry to become one of the most sought-after professionals in her field. The mother of two is unmarried.
