A fter a two weeks residency at Centre Choreographique Multicorps, Cotonou, Benin Republic, in April, to create the dance piece ‘To-Be’, Lagos-based theatre outfit, Tantoloun Productions, began another one week residency at Shodex Garden, Anthony Bus Stop, Lagos, to further develop the piece, which will be performed at the end of the residency.   This project which began yesterday is a collaboration between Tantoloun Productions (Nigeria) and Walo Dance Company (Benin), and it reflects the desire of both companies to attract a new audience and diversify in their space.   “‘To Be’, a duo dance piece by Lucrece Sidoine Atchade (Benin) and Esther Essien (Nigeria), is a stepping stone for other cross-border projects and we could not be more excited about partnering with each other than being continually circumscribed.   “Through this work in progress we wish to develop the intersection of our arts, hoping to receive support from cultural spaces and especially from festivals in Africa and around the world,” says the music/artistic director, Oyebisi Tosin A.   “The dance piece is about becoming, the act and willingness to be who we are meant to be, and the enablement to create a new and peaceful environment with equity, without global crisis. Focusing on the set goal without any set back, regardless of what the society says, and at the same time, not neglecting control, guidance, sacrifice, discipline and the rigorous process of becoming and creating a safe and better environment.”   According to him, the piece was developed using real life experiences of young people in Benin Republic as a reference to human experiences from other parts of the world. “The interviews done and other voices used in the creation are in French and other local languages.   “With the use of bass guitar, Bata drums, Djembe and shakers, the performers on stage represent intercessors intervening and travailing people’s pains and frustrations of becoming.”
