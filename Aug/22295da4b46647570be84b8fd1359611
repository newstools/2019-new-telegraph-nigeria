The Awujale and Paramount Ruler of Ijebuland, Oba Sikiru Adetona, on Tuesday, warned against the politicization of the selection process of his successor.  The revered monarch, who spoke at the 2019 Ojude Oba festival held in Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State, said kingmakers and relevant stakeholders in the state must consider capability, competence and merit in choosing the candidate to fill the stool after his demise.  He said this as Governor Dapo Abiodun praised the monarch for his role in preserving the annual festival’s pomp and pageantry as well as style and substance over the years. The festival, sponsored by Globacom, featured fanfare, equestrian display and parade of culture and tradition pepped with salutary shots from dane guns. Eminent personalities at the event included former governors of the state, Chief Olusegun Osoba and Otunba Gbenga Daniel; Deputy Governor, Engr. Noimot Salako-Oyedele; Senator Lekan Mustapha, Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, and the Chairman of Globacom, Dr Mike Adenuga Jr, who was represented by Mr Fola Aderibigbe.  In his remarks, the Awujale thanked the Ijebu sons and daughters and the Regberegbe (age grades) for providing invaluable support for kingship which, he noted, had enhanced the socio-economic development of the area.
