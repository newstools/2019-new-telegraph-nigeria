Police in Lagos have arrested two Chinese for allegedly operating a factory, where e-waste is assembled and exported to China and Vietnam. The factory was discovered by detectives attached to the Area F Police Command. The detectives also arrested the two brains behind the e-waste company, Lin Piehao (22) and Li Ruoneng (27). In the course of investigation, police discovered that the suspects visas have expired for long, but the two foreigners had continued to reside in Nigeria. Sources at the command revealed that operatives stormed No 19, Sule Abuka Street, Opebi, Ikeja factory, which had no signboard and arrested the suspects with several cartons of the e-waste already billed to be exported to China and Vietnam through air cargo. A police source said: “We got a tip-off about their activities and we stormed there and arrested them. We also discovered that the two brains behind the company are staying in Nigeria illegally. They came to Lagos in May and they were issued one month visa; but they exceeded their stay and are working in Nigeria illegally.” But Lin said they used to buy phone panels – Android and Nokia panels. He said: “We buy them from phone repairers and scrap sellers. We remove the panel I.C. with machine and then ship it to China and Vietnam. We have some Nigerian casual workers in our factory but we give them the rules and urged them to be discrete before they join us. “We actually came into Nigeria with one month visa to explore the country and to know the business we can do, but our boss in China urged us to open the factory. We have been enjoying Nigeria and did not want to go back despite the expiration of our visa. I don’t have work permit. I know it is a crime to work without work permit, but the e-waste business is very lucrative.”
