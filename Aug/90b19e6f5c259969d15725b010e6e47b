Administration of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola in Osun State has approved free train ride for the citizens living in Lagos to commemorate this year’s Eid-el-Kabir (Ileya) celebration. The gesture is in continuation of its practice during festive periods. The government said those travelling from towns on the route between Lagos State and Osun State would also benefit from the free trip. A statement from the office of the Chief Press Secretary (CPS) said the free train transportation would convey holiday makers from Iddo Terminus of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), Lagos to Nelson Mandela Freedom Park, Osogbo. The schedule of movement indicates that the train will depart the Iddo Terminus in Lagos by 10a.m. on Friday, August 9 and will be expected to arrive at the Nelson Mandela Freedom Park Train Station in Osogbo by 6p.m. of the same day. For the return journey, the train will depart the Nelson Mandela Freedom Park Train Station in Osogbo at 10a.m. on Tuesday, August 13, and arrive at the Iddo Terminus in Lagos by 6p.m., of the same day. “Since assumption of office about eight months ago, the administration of Oyetola has been providing free train services during festive periods to meet the needs of the people of the state who might not be able to afford the cost of transportation during festive periods,”the statement reads in part. “The scheme is part of the social intervention programmes of the administration, aimed at providing succour for its citizens, with a view to saving them from untold hardship and stress they normally undergo during festive periods,” the statement reads in part. The government had extended similar gestures during the 2018 Christmas and New Year celebration; also during 2019 Eid-el-Fitr as well as during the 2019 Easter celebration. Thousands of Osun citizens have benefitted from the free train movement since it was initiated by the government in 2011.
