An Ekiti State High Court sitting in Ado-Ekiti yesterday sentenced two people to death hanging for robbery and illegal possession of firearms. The convicts, Adewa Sunday and Adedayo Amos, robbed Mrs. Abosede Oyeyemi Malomo at Ilogbo Ekiti in Ido-Osi Local Government Area of the state on June 4, 2015, during a night robbery. The offence, according to the charge sheet, is contrary to Section 1(2) (a) of the Robbery and Firearm Special Provisions Act, 2004. They robbed Malomo with guns, cutlasses and other dangerous weapons, thereby inflicting bodily injuries on her. The Chief Judge of Ekiti State, Justice Ayodeji Daramola, convicted the two men. He said: “I found the accused persons guilty of armed robbery as laid down before me and they should face the supreme punishment for the offence. “Therefore, the sentence of the court upon you is that you be hanged by the neck until you are dead. “May the good Lord have mercy on your souls.” The hearing into the case began on March 27, 2017 with two -count charge bordering on robbery and illegal possession of firearms. During hearing, the prosecution counsel, Mr. Gbemiga Adaramola, from the Ministry of Justice, called two witnesses and also tendered a cut-to-size pistol, iPad and the victim’s statement on oath, as exhibits. The lawyer to the defendants, Mr. Adeyinka Opaleke, didn’t call any witness. The victim was said to be reading at night when they broke into her apartment and robbed her at gunpoint. During the operation, one of the convicts was said to have made a mistake of calling the actual name of his colleague, which served as a veritable lead for the police to carry out their investigations.
