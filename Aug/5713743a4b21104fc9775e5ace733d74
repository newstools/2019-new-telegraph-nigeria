In spite of the confirmation of minister-nominees, President Muhammadu Buhari has been advised to review the nomination of Alhaji Lai Mohammed and Senator Gbemisola Saraki, to accommodate nominees from Kwara North senatorial district. Chairman of a socio-political group in Kwara State, Edu-Pategi Progressives Association, Mr. Ahmed Dakaya, made the plea yesterday while briefing National Assembly correspondents. He lamented that the two ministerial slots from Kwara State were given to Kwara Central and Kwara South that had produced the current governor and deputy governor, respectively. Dakaya said Kwara North had been marginalised since 1999 as it had not produced the governor despite being the largest senatorial district in the state. “We want to say that although, appointing a minister is thea prerogative of the President, we believe justice, fairness and equity is what out President stands for. It is our belief that Mr. President will look at it this again. “We pray that Mr. President reconsider the nomination of the two candidates, Alhaji Lai Mohammed and Senator Gbemi Saraki, which does not have any one from the northern extraction of the state. “Mr. President can do the same as he did in Niger State in 2015 when Alhaji Ahmed Ibeto was nominated and replaced by Alhaji Bawa Bwari for equity, fairness and justice, considering the districts that already have governor and the deputy governor, respectively.”
