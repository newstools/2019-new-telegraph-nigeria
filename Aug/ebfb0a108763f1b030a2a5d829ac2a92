   Son of former governor of Kogi State late Prince Abubakar Audu and the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant, Mohammed Abubakar Audu has said the present governor of the state, Alhaji Yahaya Bello is the most favoured governor in the history of the state. According to Audu, what the present governor has got in terms revenue and assistance, no governor in the past had got that. He expressed worries that with the huge resource at the disposal of the governor, he remains the list performed governor or Military Administrator. Audu, who spoke at the APC National Secretariat in Abuja after obtaining his nomination and expression of interest forms, warned that the only thing that would save APC from the jaws of defeat of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (APC) was for the leadership to conduct free, fair and credible primaries. According to him: “APC leadership must allow the will of the people to prevail in the August primaries.” He opinionated that if the party should do anything otherwise it would afford the PDP opportunity to take over the state, as he alleged that PDP takes advantage of the bad political situation of other parties. On the issue of the late Prince Abubakar Audu’s political supporters aligning with other aspirants, Audu refuted it as he said: “We have not rented Audu’s political franchise to anybody.”
