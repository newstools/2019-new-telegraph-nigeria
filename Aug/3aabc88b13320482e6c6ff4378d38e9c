Shareholders in Nigeria have applauded the emergence of telecommunications technocrat Engr. Ernest Ndukwe as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of MTN Nigeria. In a statement signed by the President of New Dimension Shareholders Association, Mr. Patrick Ajudua, the shareholders noted that the appointment is a welcome development because he is tested and well experienced in the industry. The Association expressed optimism that the new MTN Board headed by Dr. Ernest Ndukwe will ensure transparency, compliance with corporate governance, and value addition to the shareholders. In a similar vein, the President Proactive Shareholders Association, Taiwo Oderinde, urged the new board to shun any corporate governance lapses capable of dragging the image of the firm through the mud. He noted: “The new Chairman, Ndukwe, is a man with a wealth of experience and connections in the telecommunications sector. As a one-time head of NCC, I believe with the support of other members of the board, he will bring this to bear in his new responsibility. I congratulate him and he should not let the shareholders and other stakeholders down.” Ndukwe, a former Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) of Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), has vast experience and rich contributions to the growth of telecommunications industry over the years. A telecommunications professional, Ndukwe’s career has gone full circle, starting from the private sector as the Managing Director of a notable telecommunications company, he moved into government service at the helm of the industry regulatory agency as EVC of NCC and back to the private sector and now Chairman of Nigeria’s largest operating company MTN.
