S hina Peller’s name is synonymous with night club business in Nigeria.  Having plied his trade for some years, the CEO of Aquila Group of Companies has redefined the face of the business to the admiration of all.  His entry into the business had been hailed by many who know his antecedent as an accomplished entrepreneur.  Consequently, since Quilox Nite Club kicked-off five years ago, he has proved that he has the Midas touch to change the clubbing business in Nigeria.  Quilox has become a fun spot for top businessmen, politicians and die-hard fun lovers, among others, from across social divides. However, the outfit, which is regarded as one of the biggest and most luxurious in the continent of Africa, seems to be gradually losing its luster.   Celeb Lounge gathered that since the Oyo State-born businessman was elected into the House of Representatives, the club has suffered a serious decline in status. It has allegedly lost patronage of its many patrons, as Peller’s attention seems to be divided now.  The source disclosed further that the upscale fun place might be relocating from its present location on Ozumba Mbadiwe, as Peller has fallen out with the real owner of the building, who is a newly elected governor of a state in the South Western region of Nigeria.  Our source also disclosed that the upwardly mobile man is also thinking of replicating the type of club in Abuja.  The top socialite is also the Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of Aquila Oil and Gas Limited, a new-generation, systems-driven oil and gas firm that has made a strong presence in the oil sector in its 12 years of existence.   He was elected a lawmaker during the last general election to represent Iseyin/Itesiwaju/Iwajowa/ Kajola Federal Constituency in Oyo State.
