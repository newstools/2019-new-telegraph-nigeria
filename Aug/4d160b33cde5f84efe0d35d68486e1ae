Startling revelations emerged yesterday in Benin, the Edo State capital, on how suspects plotted to execute a foiled jailbreak to free a suspect being held at the Oko maximum prisons in the state. The shocking confession of a 40- year -old man, Oheneme Kingsley, exposed all the secret deals that later blew open.  He disclosed that he paid N20, 000 to some gunmen of Ijaws extraction to break his brother out of the Oko minimum security prison. Kingsley said his brother, Wisdom, a former policeman, was convicted for murder. He said he was asked to pay N200, 000 but he could only raise N20, 000.  Kingsley was among the three suspects arrested for plotting to release some condemned prisoners in the Oko minimum security prison. Other suspects are Raphael Ebisin, aged 34 and Amos Isuku, aged 35.  According to the suspect: “They called me that some Ijaws wanted to free their people from prisons and that I should pay N200, 000 so that my brother can be released but I told them I don’t have any money.  “They said I should send N20, 000 which they will use to contact some persons and I did. I sent the money and I was arrested. My brother sent me an account number from prison.” Raphael, who is an international driver, said he was contacted by his cousin, Hope, who police described as a notorious kidnapper that just left prison custody.
