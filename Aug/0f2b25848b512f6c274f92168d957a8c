Police in Ogun State have arrested a 52-year-old man, Emmanuel Ikhine, for allegedly having forceful and unlawful carnal knowledge of his 18-year-old biological daughter (name withheld).
The victim was said to be the only female among the three children of her father.
The state Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, who confirmed the arrest in a statement on Monday, said Ikhine had already confessed to the sexual abuse.
Oyeyemi disclosed that the suspect had been having carnal knowledge of his daughter since his separation with his wife.
According to him, the randy father was arrested by detectives detailed by the Divisional Police Officer in charge of Sango-Otta, CSP Godwin Idehai, following a report by their neighbour identified as Yemisi Ashade.
He said: “The suspect who resides at No 6, Iyaniwura Street, Joju area of Sango-Otta was arrested following a report by one Yemisi Ashade who came to the station with the victim and complained that the victim came to her to report how her father has been abusing her sexually whenever she is alone at home with threat to deal with her if she dares tell anyone about it.
“She stated further that she can no longer bear the sexual assault hence she confided in her.”
