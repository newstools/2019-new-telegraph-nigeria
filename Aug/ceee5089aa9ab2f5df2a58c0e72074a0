A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State Segun Ajayi, yesterday called on the remaining 12 Edo State House of Assembly members – Elect yet to be sworn in to emulate their Bauchi state counterparts and present themselves to the assembly. In a statement made available to newsmen in Kaduna, Ajayi disclosed that the members should immediately present themselves in the interest of the development of the state. He said, “The quarrel and infighting among you all against our amiable governor, Gov. Godwin Obaseki is very unnecessary and uncalled for in the very first instance. “I implore you all to emulate your counterparts in Bauchi State who shared similar view and circumstances upon the proclamation of the House by their governor, Alh. Bala Mohammed like you members- elect and have since provided themselves for inauguration in the interest of peace, development and general well-being of the state.”You all were voted to go and represent your people by making laws that will impact their lives and not to go and be fighting over the seat of the speakership or other principal offices. “As it stands now, your constituents are being denied a voice and representation in the assembly. Wholly because of your decisions to deny them the opportunity of been well represented at the floor of the House.” He said. Part of the statement also said, “I wish to call on all twelve remaining members- elect of the Edo State House of Assembly who are yet to provide themselves for swearing in as members of the house to do so without any further delay. “You must all excuse yourselves from all undue influences that suggest fighting against the interest of our dear Governor Godwin Obaseki whose track records since assumption of office have been progressive and people oriented.”
