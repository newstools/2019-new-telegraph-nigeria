A 15-year-old boy drowned on Tuesday at the Ikpirima quarters, Osubi in Okpe Local Government Area of Delta State. According to members of the community, the deceased, identified as Onoriode, a Junior Secondary School (3) boy, drowned in a flood caused by rainfall. “Onoriode came in company with three other children within the age bracket of 13 and 14 to fish in the pool of water, beside the Osubi Airport, following the persistent dredging work, from Agbasa area of Warri in Warri South,” a witness said. One of the deceased’s relatives, who was seen weeping, explained that no member of the family was aware that the children went fishing. She also lamented that the news would be devastating to the family members, especially their mother, a petty trader. A prominent member of the community, who did not disclose his name, said they tried in the past to stop children from going close to the pool of water, stressing that the depth of the water was quite unimaginable. He said: “None of the children from this area will go close to it. You can see that they are all from a distant community.” Another member of the community disclosed that they always record deaths in the water every year. He urged government to urgently come up with measures to channel the water to existing canals to avoid more death. At press time, divers were at the scene of the incident, searching for Onoriode’s body.
