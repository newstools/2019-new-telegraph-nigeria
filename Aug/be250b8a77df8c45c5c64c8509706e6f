The table tennis foundation led by Sarah Hanffou and Funke Oshonaike at the weekend presented eight African countries with an equipment donation. Botswana, Chad, Eritrea, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya and Uganda were the recipients. The presentations were made by Sarah Hanffou, the founder of Ping Sans Frontières, an organisation which uses table tennis as a vehicle for education and to make a positive change in society. Osonaike recalled that similar donations were made during the Nigeria Open in Lagos. “I am always eager to make the young ones better and this foundation is a project to close to my heart,” the Nigerian legend said. Sarah Hanffou said: “We are supporting Botswana because they presented a very interesting grassroots development project with two main goals; introducing table tennis in pre-schools through the building of concrete tables and use of mini tables, as well as cultivating an interest of playing table tennis at a younger stage. Also Uganda decided to bring a women’s team to the 12th African Games in Morocco, they are making huge efforts to support girls and women. “Kenya has also brought the youngest player of the tournament, Jenny Compell. We welcome her in the table tennis family and congratulate the Kenya Table Tennis Association for the efforts towards girls and women. “Countries like Eritrea, Guinea and Chad are participating in the African Games for the first time. We want to encourage them to participate in continental events and to set up table tennis programmes for girls. In Ghana, we have been supporting the NK Foundation based in Takoradi and the Asoba Foundation based in Accra.” Khaled El-Salhy, President of African Table Tennis Federation commended Ping Sans Frontières for their support; Fahd Daim, Secretary-General of the Kenya Table Tennis Association endorsed the views
