Following intelligence reports on the causes of pipeline explosion in Ijegun area, the Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo- Olu of Lagos State has disclosed that plans have been concluded to pull down illegal structures located within Ijegun community in Alimosho Local Government and other parts of the state.  Briefing journalists after the monthly security meeting held at the State House, Alausa Secretariat, Ikeja, which was attended by security chiefs in the state, Sanwo-Olu noted that security reports showed that continued existence of the structures would aid vandals in destruction of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) pipelines within the state. To beef up the security around the community to forestall future vandalism, Sanwo-Olu said the state government would work with all security agencies including Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, (NSCDC), to remove the structures.  He said: “During the meeting, we discussed the incident around pipeline vandalism which brought us down last month. We have resolved among ourselves that we will stop at nothing, including engaging the communities where these facilities are located, to give our people assurance.  “And part of the things that will happen it will be unlikely that some properties will not be removed in some locations because we have done aeriel surveillance and we discovered that some property were used for bunkering and as store house for jerry cans.  “The government is coming to remove those structures and destroy those facilities. In their own interest, they should start removing them before we come. We have mapped out the layout of the places where the properties are. And we have decided to collaborate with NSCDC and NNPC to achieve the desired goal,” the governor added.
