   Many Nigerians have met their untimely deaths even as others are continuously consuming poisonous and other lethal substances in place of food, drinks and beverages due to the failure of the different regulatory bodies in charge of safeguarding the health and wellbeing of the nation. CJIKIOKE IREMEKA reports  Miss Lucy Ogbodo, no doubt, may have had the worst of trips for the year when she travelled to Onitsha from Lagos recently. Her last recreational trip was a show of great embarrassment and discomfiture even as she was gorgeously dressed. She vomited and defecated all through the journey in an embarrassing manner due to a bottled malt (soft drink) she took few minutes into the journey.  It was suspected to be adulterated Not even the combination of tetracycline and flagyl (drugs) administered on her by a co-traveller were able to salvage the situation as she vomited indiscriminately. Also, other passengers made futile efforts to restore her health to normal as she continued to hold and squeeze her tummy in pains while vomiting.  More so, sympathizers’ soft words targeted at calming her down failed too as she made no pretenses crying her eyes out and appealed to the bus driver to stop within short intervals for her to throw up and defecate. Initially, she managed to vomit through the window of the bus, but being a moving vehicle, the hurls was messing up the vehicle which spurred the driver to stop each time she wanted to vomit. Lucy’s body system changed after she finished taking plastic bottled malt which many people said was counterfeited malt brewed illegally at one of the numerous illegal brewing plants in Lagos.  “I bought the malt in this park (Ojota) as I alighted from bus. I didn’t suspect anything because it had almost the same taste with some of the canned malt that I have taken before, though there was a slight but unnoticeable difference,” she said. “It was when I started experiencing this that I tried to remember the name of the malt which I bought but I couldn’t put a name to it,” she quipped.  According to her, she thought the slight difference in the taste could be a distinctive taste to distinguish a particular brand from other products flocking the Nigerian market unregulated. At a gaze, she thought the malt was named after a particular brand which she wasn’t familiar with, until much later she discovered the name of the malt was unknown to her.  “I was never been humbled as I was that day and I thank God that the driver was a good man. Before, I was still trying to hold myself as a lady but at point, it dawn on me that I can’t hold it anymore without seeking help,” she said. “I thought my intestines were going to cut. It was so disgraceful and painful. When I got to Onitsha, I had to go for full medical checkup. As it stands, I don’t think I will buy anything again, especially a product I don’t know its name or address of the manufacturer, when travelling,” she added.  “There are too many fake products in the country but unfortunately, the government is not doing anything about it. We really missed late Prof. Dora Akunyili,” added Lucy, a graduate of Public Administration. In similar case, Dr. Segun Aremu said the unchecked rise in counterfeiting products and drugs in the country is alarming, saying that the country’s regulatory bodies have failed in their responsibility of safeguarding the health and wellbeing of the country.  At Oshodi, he bought a bottled plastic Pepsi Cola, after work in the evening but at this time the old pep not the one that has yellow strip around the neck that reads ‘20% extra at same price.’ “After buying the chilled drink, I boarded a bus and opened the drink. I drank the drink but it was a way far different from the taste I know. I tried to pour it on the floor of the vehicle (Nissan Coaster) which I boarded to Mile 2, but the content foamed suggesting it was airtight,” he said. He checked the expiring date but that was not visible anymore. <img class="size-medium wp-image-234461 alignleft" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/substandard-drugs-products6.png?resize=300%2C169&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/substandard-drugs-products6.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/substandard-drugs-products6.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1"> So, he tasted it once again yet. It didn’t taste the same and to be on safer side, he had to fling it off through window understanding what a fake and or expired product can do to one’s health. Segun is so familiar with the taste of Pepsi that even in the middle of sleep he will tell you the difference between a pepsi and a coke. According to him, even if his eyes were to be tied and given both drinks, he will be able to detect which is which. He concluded that the product was adulterated by some people as there have been cases of mushrooms illegal wineries and bottling companies in the state. They are left unchecked by the regulatory bodies in the country, especially in Lagos.  Sunday Telegraph investigation showed that the rate at which product counterfeiting is thriving in the country is alarming. It also shows that the regulatory bodies saddled with the responsibility of safeguarding the life and health of the nation have compromised.  Hence, the counterfeiters of popular brands in Nigeria are making a kill of the illegal business occasioned by the inability of regulatory bodies, especially National Administration of Food and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC) which saddled with responsibility of regulating and controlling the food have in this country to step up their game.  This has given rise to proliferation of illegal ‘one corner breweries’ where the fakers churn out dangerous products that are injurious to the health of the end consumers, which in some cases, leave the victims with perpetual deformity. According to social commentator, Mr. Hillary Ugboji, the quest for survival today in Nigeria with no sense of direction has pushed many Nigerians into illegalities.  He noted that the case of counterfeiting product has been on upward since the current administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, saying that while issue of corruption in the public sector is being romanced with, a greater corruption is springing up from all sphere of the country.  According to him, market trends showed an increase in counterfeiting, even as enforcement scores significant wins, saying in Nigeria, HP, in collaboration with security agents, has raided several hideouts in Lagos, where counterfeit HP consumables were sold and arrest was affected.  He said: “Already counterfeiting is costing the global economy $3 billion per year according to the Imaging Supplies Coalition, the growing risk of fake products was driven by an increasingly broad supplier ecosystem, lack of certainty by buyers that their purchases are genuine, and a lack of awareness of the risks of purchasing counterfeit goods.”  Just recently, the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) raised concern over the growing number of fake and substandard products in the country.  The President of LCCI, Babatunde Ruwase, made the observation at a press briefing on the state of the economy in Lagos. Mr. Ruwase said the counterfeiting of products posed a grave danger to the health and safety of the citizens. According to him, the issue constitutes a major challenge to leading brands in the consumer and durable products sector, as it erodes their market share, profit margin, and impacts adversely on their reputation.  He called for better investment in the capacity of the Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) and the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), toward tackling the problem of fake and substandard products.   He also urged the Federal Government to address concerns about overlapping responsibilities of SON, NAFDAC and the Weight and Measures Unit of Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment. Analysing a report whivh said Nigeria and other countries lose $3bn to counterfeit products yearly, the Director Global Anti- Counterfeit Programme at HP, Glenn Jones, said: “Every one of the key market indicators we monitor show a significant increase in the risk of counterfeit print supplies.   “For companies like HP, counterfeits undermine decades of focused research and testing aimed at creating superior ink and toner, and reliable, high-quality cartridges for our customers.  For users, fakes cause a significant increase in print failures, low page yield; poor print quality, leaks and clogs, in addition to voiding hardware warranties.” Sunday Telegraph learnt according to Harris Interactive surveys, the past four years have shown a 30 per cent plus drop in companies working with a trusted, primary supplier, and a 27 per cent increase in companies buying purely on availability
