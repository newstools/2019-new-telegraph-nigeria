J ose Mourinho claimed that the Manchester City ‘B team’ has more chance of winning the Premier League this season than his former clubs Manchester United and Chelsea.   United got their Premier League campaign underway with a 4-0 bashing of the Blues on Sunday, but the Portuguese doesn’t hold much hope for either side ahead of the new season.   When asked on Sky Sports who he thought was in the race for the title, Mourinho identified four teams: “Manchester City, Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City B team.   “Even if one team plays magnificently or has a fantastic result, I don’t believe the title is possible.”    Both clubs are coming into the 2019-20 season as relatively unknown quantities, with new managers still getting their feet under the table.   Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will be hoping the big-money signings of Harry Maguire and Aaron Wan-Bissaka can help to prove that his promising start to life at Old Trafford was no flash in the pan.   Chelsea, meanwhile, are embracing a new dawn with Frank Lampard at the helm. Restricted by a transfer ban, they are expected to rely heavily on their vast array of youngsters in the coming year.   But whatever they do achieve this season, it seems that Manchester City’s Premier League crown is an unassailable one – for Mourinho’s old clubs, at least.
