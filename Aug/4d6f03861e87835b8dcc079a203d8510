Acting Chairman of the EFCC, Mr. Ibrahim Magu, who made the disclosure at a press briefing at the commission’s headquarters in Abuja on Friday, vowed to identify and bring suspects to deserved justice. According to Magu, most of the ‘Yahoo Yahoo Boys’ had relocated to Ghana, owing to intensified raids on their hideouts. “It is very sad. It’s like the era of these 419ners,Yahoo Yahoo Boys is coming back. “I remember we worked with the FBI in Lagos (and others); we carried out this operation Wire Wire. “We are reenergising; we will go out and storm all their hideouts. Most of them have relocated to Ghana, because the heat is on them,” Magu said. He pledged the readiness of the commission to sustain the on-going collaboration with relevant agencies, with a view to curbing the menace of cyber-crime. Earlier, the Chairman of the Diaspora Commission, Mrs. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, expressed concern over the arrest of 77 Nigerians in the United States, in connection with alleged cyber-crime.
