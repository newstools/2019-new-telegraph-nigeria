Kogi State All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant, Dalami Mohammed, has said that rotational governance would restore peace in the state. According to him, the level of crime in Kogi State was as a result of some people occupying political positions in the state and at the federal level. Mohammed, who was a retired public servant from NNPC, said his interest to govern Kogi State was for him to impact lives. According to him, his going into governance was for him to serve and not to govern. Speaking after obtaining his nomination and expression of interest forms at the APC National Secretariat, the aspirant, who was from Ankpa Local Government Area of Kogi East senatorial district, said his governance would remove tears from eyes of Kogi people. He stated that his governance would not depart from the manifesto of the party, as that would be a guide to him. He said: “l am to serve, not to govern. I will not go against APC manifesto. I will restore peace and develop Kogi State. “All we need to do is to develop Kogi State, because it is the connecting point to the South from the North.” On the mode of primaries, the aspirant said: “I am not afraid whether it is direct or indirect, but the national leadership of APC should listen to the APC masses in Kogi State demanding for direct primaries,” he said.
