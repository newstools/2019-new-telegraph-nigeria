The Southern Youths Development Union (SYDU) has decried the security situation in the country as unacceptable, and therefore, have called for a national youth summit aimed at bringing youths from all the regions in the country together to brainstorm as Nigerians, not as ethnic citizens of their regions.  Speaking through their President, Pastor Bassey James, they warned that the political class, traditional rulers and other powerful individuals should indeed be mindful of whatever they say.  Pastor James disclosed that body has concluded arrangements to host a national youth summit in each of the geographic regions of the country, adding that the summit was intended to “give the youths of our great nation a sense of hope and to encourage them to do what is right.”  He said: “There is need for our youths to believe in Nigeria; hence we also want to build a sense of direction for their future.   “The attention this time is to build collaboration among the southern youths, northern youths and also our elders; because I think that the issue insecurity, crime and criminality today are principally with the youths.”  He explained that all kinds of criminality are not committed by the elders or senior citizens.  “They are committed by the young between the ages of 17 to 50. So I think that we should start talking to the youths. “We need to build confidence in their lives and to create an environment for interaction.  That’s a major thing; and to look at how cement the relationship amongst the youth of our nation in totality, build a cohesion and to assure them that it can always get better,” James said. The youths urged governments and other relevant agencies to key into the summit, which has been slated for October.
