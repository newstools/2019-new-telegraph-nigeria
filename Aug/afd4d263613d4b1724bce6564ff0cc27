The proscribed Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), also known as Shi’ites, yesterday filed a suit challenging its proscription by Justice Nkeonye Maha of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja.  The group had filed its motion on notice yesterday before the same judge who granted the proscription order based on an ex-parte application filed by the Federal Government. By the proscription order which had consequently been gazetted by the Federal Government, the group is designated as a terrorist group.  In the application, the group through its counsel, Femi Falana (SAN), alleged as part of the grounds for seeking the reversal of the proscription order that it was made without jurisdiction. It further contended that the court lacked the jurisdiction to issue the ex parte order against a non-juristic body like IMN which is not a registered entity.  It also alleged that the order breached the fundamental right of all its members to fair hearing, guaranteed by section 36 of the 1999 Constitution. It alleged that the ex parte order violated its members’ right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.  It, therefore, pray for an order setting aside, discharging or vacating the ex parte order of the court made on 26th day of July, 2019 Coram N.E Maha J in suit no FHC/ABJ/ CS/876/2019 between the Attorney General of the Federation V. Islamic Movement in Nigeria, proscribing the existence and activities of the respondent /applicant in any part of Nigeria under whatever form, either in groups or as individuals by whatever names they are called or referred to.
