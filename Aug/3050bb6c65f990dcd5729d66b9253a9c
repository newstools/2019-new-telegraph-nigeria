Gunmen yesterday invaded Zaki-Biam, the commercial nerve centre of Ukum Local Government Area of Benue State, and murdered the yam market Chairman, Mr. Tavershima Achinge. The assassins stormed the area on a Bajaj motorcycle and went to Achingeâ€™s house. The gunmen shot him several times on the chest and stomach, and then left him in a pool of blood, with his intestines gushing out. When the sporadic shootings started, neighbours fled the area for fear of a repeat of the attack. It was learnt that the deceased had just retired to his residence from the market when the suspected assassins suddenly appeared and immediately opened fire on him. A close relative to the victim, who did not want his name in print, said that they were at home when it happened. The relative said that they were lucky to escape from the scene as the hoodlums shot sporadically, leaving Achinge dead. The Chairman, Caretaker Committee, Ukum Local Government Area, Mr. Tor-Tyokyaa Ibellogo, confirmed the incident. He said the identities of the gunmen were unknown. The chairman appealed to the police to launch a manhunt for the fleeing culprits with the aim of tracking them down and bringing them to justice. Ibellogo also challenged the security agencies to intensify surveillance to avert reoccurrence. It was learnt that the body of Achinge had since been deposited at a private mortuary. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Catherine Anene, also confirmed the killing, adding that the command was on top of the situation.
