A High Court sitting in Ilorin, Kwara State, has ordered the final forfeiture of N150 million plaza belonging to a civil servant in the state. The Ilorin zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) urged the court to give an order of final forfeiture of Asmau Plaza on the University of Ilorin Road, Tanke area of the metropolis, to the Federal Government. EFCC argued that the said property was acquired with proceeds from unlawful activity. In the affidavit deposed to by an investigating officer with the EFCC, Musa Gidado, the commission urged the court to order the final forfeiture of the plaza. He said: “Investigations revealed that the owner of the property, Rasaq Momonu, used his influence as accountant with Kwara State government to inflate and award contracts for the construction of two classrooms at Ogbondoroko and Obanisuwa communities, Asa Local Government Area of the state. “Investigations further revealed that the respondent, who is a civil servant that earns less than N100,000 in a month, cannot afford to build the house known as Asmau Plaza between 2010 and 2012. “That I know as a fact that the respondent was confronted with the above findings by the applicant which he did not dispute and has agreed to forfeit the property known as Asmau Plaza to the Federal Government of Nigeria.” Moving the application for final forfeiture, the EFCC counsel, Nnaemeka Omewa, urged the court to grant the order based on the provisions of Section 17 of the Advance Fee Fraud and other Related Offences Act 2006. He said: “My lord, we have a motion on notice dated 19th July 2019 and filed on the same day; the motion is brought pursuant to Section 17 of the Advance Fee Fraud and other Related Offences.  I urged the court to grant the motion.” Delivering his judgement, Justice Sikiru Oyinloye held that the EFCC had fulfilled all the requirements in the suit and thereby ordered that the said property be forfeited to the Federal Government.
