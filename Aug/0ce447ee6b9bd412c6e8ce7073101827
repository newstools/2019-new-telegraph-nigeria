Policemen in Osun State yesterday beat protesters, who converged on the Orita-Olaiya in Osogbo for the RevolutionNow protest. The protesters included teenagers, aged women and members of the Coalition For Revolution (CORE). The policemen were reportedly led by the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in charge of Dugbe Police Station, Osogbo, Mr. Leke Ogunkanmi. The policemen also shot sporadically into the air to disperse the crowd. Also, a 70-year-old ‘Fufu’ seller, Mrs. Sariyu Akanmu, who joined the protesters, was also beaten mercilessly despite her age. Beside, leader of the protesters, Olawale Adebayo and five others were beaten and bundled into one of the police vehicles. They were driven to the state police command headquarters. Also, a journalist with NewsDirect newspaper, Mr. Sunday Oguntuyi, was one of the journalists who were victims of police brutality. Ogunkanmi, whose men maltreated journalists for covering the protest, threatened to shoot the newsmen. Before the police intervention, the protesters had as early as 8a.m., converged on the popular Olaiya Junction, Osogbo. However, they were prevented from moving round the ancient. There was, however, a mild-drama at the scene of the protest when a senior police officer instructed his men to forcibly withdraw protesters’ banners. But the protesters vehemently resisted the attempt. The policemen, however, used the threat of gun to seize their microphones. They also ordered the protesters to vacate the venue but the angry people rebuffed the order. This made the police to arrest 10 protesters. Those arrested were whisked away to the Department of State Services (DSS) and the state police command headquarters. It was observed that security men were stationed at strategic places in Osogbo to ensure protection of lives and property.
