The Police Service Commission (PSC) yesterday said it had put on hold the ongoing recruitment even as it advised candidates to remain patient. This was as the commission warned against attempts to usurp its constitutional mandate, and said such would be resisted. President Muhammadu Buhari had given a directive for the recruitment of 10,000 police personnel of the rank and file.  A statement by the Head of Press and Public Relations, PSC, Mr. Ikechukwu Ani, said: “The Police Service Commission has enjoined applicants for recruitment into the constable cadre of the Nigeria Police Force to exercise some patience as it finalises the remaining stage of the recruitment exercise.  “The commission also   wishes to advise all the candidates who participated in the recruitment exercise up to the aptitude test, to ignore any list or information on the exercise emanating from outside the Commission. “It is the constitutional responsibility of the commission to recruit Nigerians into the Police Force whether as Constables, Cadet Inspectors or Cadet ASPs and the Commission is not ready to abdicate this very important mandate.  “The commission will resist any attempt to ambush the on-going recruitment exercise or dilute its content. It notes that such attempt will be an affront on the Constitution and a waste of national resources.  “The commission wishes to put the on-going exercise on hold in order to finalise the remaining stage of the exercise. Candidates are to wait for further directives from the commission.”
