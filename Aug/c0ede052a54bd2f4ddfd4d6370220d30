The  Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sold a total of N114.6 billion worth of treasury bills yesterday  in its first such auction since mid-July, as it seeks to boost dollar liquidity in the currency market after the naira fell, traders said. According to Reuters, the  apex bank offered to sell  N100 billion  of bills in maturities of three, six and 12 months but got bids of N454.9 billion, with the one-year paper winning around 80 per cent of the demand. The news agency quoted a trader as saying: “It is a surprise auction. I don’t know why they are floating it without prior announcement. This one-off might not help dollar liquidity unless they become consistent in the offering.” Pressure has been building on the naira, as oil prices drop and foreign investors book profits on local bonds in response to falling yields. The CBN sold the most-liquid one-year bill at 12 per cent yesterday  lower than the 12.25 per cent it paid at its last auction in July and compared with as high as 18 per cent it fetched a year ago. Forex trading was thin on Wednesday. The naira was quoted at N363.50 per dollar on Monday and Tuesday compared with  N362.50 at the end of last week as foreign investors repatriated funds, they said. The regulator  was conducting regular weekly OMO auctions until July, when it switched focus to trying to boost economic output following recession by telling banks to lend more or face a rise in minimum reserve requirements.
