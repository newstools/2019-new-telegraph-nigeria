The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has advised the All Progressives Congress (APC) not to waste tax payers money in form of “trader moni” in Bayelsa and Kogi State, stating that such would not buy vote for the party in the November 16 governorship elections. The party also warned Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu to be ready to face the consequences if he attempts to rig the elections in favour of APC. PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, at an interactive session with newsmen on Tuesday, advised Kogi State governor, Yahaya Bello to begin now to prepare his handover note. Ologbindiyan claimed that Kogi and Bayelsa states are traditional PDP states. “Kogi people, for your information cannot be bought with money. They are not goods on the shelves that Governor Bello will just wake up and say ‘if I pay this amount I will win’. “Don’t also forget that Kogi has a history of changing their governors at their convenience. In 2003 the late Prince Abubakar Audu was voted out of office because of non-payment of salaries. “So the people of Kogi State have natural way of determining who has done well or who has failed them, and they will naturally replace anyone who has failed them,” he said.
