In many parts of the world, particularly in Nigeria, the best way to show prosperity is to acquire properties that others only wish they can have. In the entertainment industry, most celebs show off their fortunes by buying luxury cars and houses to the joy of their fans. Nigerian actress, Bella Ebinum, has not only acquired a new ride, but a Mercedes Benz, as she joins the league of celebs who own expensive cars. To celebrate the new whip, Bella shared a video of her ride on her Instagram page with a caption that reads: “The favour of God is better than labour.” Bella also shared a photo of herself posing with her Benz. Just few days ago, there was report that Nigerian music star, Wizkid’s bodyguard, Roy, recently became a landlord as he now owns a house.  There is no doubt that people who are friends or work with celebs benefit from the relationship.
