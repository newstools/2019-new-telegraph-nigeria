The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has unveiled a new mobile application platform ” Fastgov App” to help residents lodge complaints and also make useful suggestions to the administration. Fastgov App is said to be first of its kind in  Nigeria and was designed to facilitate governance of effective service delivery in Abuja through citizen participation. Unveiling the initiative, Permanent Secretary,  FCTA,  Mr. Christian Ohaa, urged residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to key into the new mobile phone application, ‘FastGov’, for their complaints and suggestions to the administration. Ohaa stated that the new application could also be to reach the administration for emergency services, while creating more  access to FCT business directory. The Permanent Secretary noted that the administration would also leverage on the new App in tackling the festering security threats, through vital information that residents would share in the app. The online application,  according to the promoters, is on the Google Play store website and is  fully automated, fast and with huge storage/sharing capacity, on which the user would not only access instant information, but also perform various other actions. Ohaa noted that new application is a demonstration of how far the administration has come in the application of technology to everyday living, adding that the FCT has always been pioneers in the application of technology to governance and government/citizen relationship. Director of information and Communications, Mrs. Stella Ojeme, had explained that ‘FastGov’ is a web and mobile application, which would enable the public to communicate and transact with the administration faster than the conventional method. Ojeme noted that the launch of the new application would give faster and unhindered access to the public to the services provided by the secretariats, departments and agencies (SDS) in the administration.
