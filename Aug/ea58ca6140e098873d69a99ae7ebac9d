Barcelona have begun negotiating a cash deal with a player exchange to sign Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain, sources have told ESPN FC. According to ESPN FC sources, Barca are prepared to offer as much as €100 million with Philippe Coutinho and Ivan Rakitic — whom Barca will need to convince in order to make the switch — included as part of the deal. Until now, Barca had hoped to negotiate using only players. As well as Coutinho and Rakitic, the Spanish champions had considered adding Ousmane Dembele and Nelson Semedo even though the Portugal international is considered “unsellable.” However, sources have told ESPN FC that PSG are not too keen on Rakitic but are interested in Coutinho and continue to push for Semedo to be included in the deal. An initial offer of €60m plus Coutinho from Barcelona has already been rejected by PSG, according to ESPN FC sources. A meeting between the two clubs took place on Tuesday, with sources telling ESPN FC that Camp Nou President, Josep Maria Bartomeu sent Director of Football, Eric Abidal and Technical Secretary, Javier Bordas to represent the club. Also in attendance was Andre Cury, the club’s Director based in Brazil, who has a strong relationship with Neymar’s family. PSG Sporting Director, Leonardo was also present alongside trusted No. 2 Angelo Castellazzi, while superagent Pini Zahavi, who brokered Neymar’s move from Barca to the Ligue 1 side, was also expected to be there. Sources say no major advances were made during the meeting, which Barca are viewing as the first contact between the two clubs as negotiations step up. PSG stood firm with the hope of a bidding war breaking out between Barca and Real Madrid. Barca still believe the deal is “very complicated,” but Madrid’s inability to meet PSG’s demands could help the Blaugrana.
