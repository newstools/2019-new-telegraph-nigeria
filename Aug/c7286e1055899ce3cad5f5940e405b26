S okoto State government yesterday said it would adopt Indonesiaâ€™s interest-free loan scheme for the benefit of small and medium scale business community in the state. Governor Aminu Tambuwal stated this while receiving Sultan Muhammad Saad Abubakar, who paid him Sallah homage in his residence.   Tambuwal said during his recent official visit to Indonesia, he saw many programmes that could be adopted for the benefit of the people.   He therefore assured the emir and the people of the state that the Zakkat and Endowment Programme would be run devoid of politics, adding also that a commission, comprising of people without any political inclination, would soon be constituted in this regard. The governor also said that his administration would soon map out strategies that would provide employment opportunities for the teeming youths of the state.   He said the state government, in collaboration with security agencies, would continue to adopt measures that would ensure lasting peace in the state.   He thanked the Sultan for his leadership, members of the Sultanate Council and District Heads for their support to his administration. Earlier, Sultan Muhammad Saad Abubakar, commended the governor and his lieutenants for the assistance given to the people in various sectors. The Sultan also urged leaders in the state to differentiate between politics and governance, pointing out that the period of politics was over, hence the need to unite and work together for the progress of the state.
