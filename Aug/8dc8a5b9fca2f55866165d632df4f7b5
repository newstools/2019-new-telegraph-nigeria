Odion Ighalo is set to rescind his decision to quit the Nigeria national team, the Super Eagles, New Telegraph has learnt. The Shenhua Shanghai striker sensationally announced his retirement from international football after helping the Super Eagles to third place finish at the 2019 African Cup of Nations hosted by Egypt. Ighalo scored impressive five goals to emerge the highest goal scorer at the competition and many Nigerians were surprised the former Watford hit man called it quit after such impressive showing. Eagles Manager Gernot Rohr had said Ighalo was welcome back into the fold at anytime even though they will respect his decision to stay out and the President of the Nigeria Football Federation Amaju Pinnick had also said they were talking to the player to drop the idea of throwing in the towel. However, it seems efforts to retain the services of the former Granada of Spain star have paid off after the striker suggested he would continue with the national team after he posted a picture of him with the Super Eagles on twitter with a cryptic caption, saying “Coming Back Stronger”
