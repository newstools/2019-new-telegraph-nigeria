Oyo State Police Commissioner, Mr. Olushina Olukolu, yesterday paraded four men said to be arms and ammunition dealers. Olukolu said his men recovered 10,000 live cartridges from the suspects. The suspects were paraded at the Eleyele Police Command, Ibadan, along with 18 others linked with sundry offences including armed robbery, burglary and others. The four suspects were identified as Adekunle Abimbola (32), Abel Kojo (54), Mukaila Ariyo (27) and Ade Adebayo (31). The Commissioner, Olukolu, said the suspects were arrested in their hideout having been discovered to be selling ammunition to different armed robbery gangs who had been terrorising the public in Ibadan metropolis and other parts of the state, particularly at Okebola area of Ibadan. He said: “About 2p.m., on 23rd July, 2019, we received information about some notorious hoodlums who specialise in supplying of arms and ammunition to different armed robbery syndicates that have been terrorising members of the public within and outside Ibadan metropolis, and other parts of Oyo State. The SARS team swung into action and in the process, four of the hoodlums were arrested. “Recovered from them were 10,000 pieces of live cartridges, an unregistered Toyota Sienna and a Toyota Camry car with registration number Lagos GGE 979 FT.” But one of the suspects, Kojo, denied selling arms to robbers. He said: “I sell arms and ammunition for local hunters that I know they cannot use it for illegal means. I have no registration backing up my business. I started the business a year and some months ago.” However, Olukolu advised residents to be wary of unregistered Okada riders who carry more than one passenger early in the morning and late in the night especially during the Eid el Kabir (Ileya) festivities, which according to him “is a season prone to high crime rate”.
