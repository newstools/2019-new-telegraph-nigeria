Yesterday was a sad day for men of the police at Aba Area Command, Abia State, as they lost one of their worthy and gallant personnel to a suspected kidnapper. The deceased identified as Anyanime Udobat, an indigene of Akwa Ibom State, was a member of the very active Anti-Kidnapping Squad that has been keeping the city of Aba safe. The suspected kidnapper also lost his life during a shootout with the police. New Telegraph learnt that Udobat, who was well known as the driver of the squad and his colleagues, on a tip off, went after a notorious kidnapping kingpin around the Aro-Ngwa axis of Osisioma Local Government Area in the wee hours of yesterday. There are, however, two versions to the incident. One angle said Udobat was shot on the neck by the suspected kidnapper while peeping through his window. Another version had it that he was shot while trying to gain entrance into the house of the suspect to effect arrest with his colleagues. A police source, however, said that the operation by the Anti-Kidnapping Squad was carried out in the night of Tuesday, but went awry when the suspect allegedly pulled out a pump action gun from his window and shot Udobat, who died on the spot. The source, however, said that the team fought gallantly to get the suspect arrested, but he was killed during shootout. When our reporter visited the Aba Area Command, everyone was discussing the death of the policeman, who many described as a good man. It was also learnt that Udobat, who is survived by his wife and four children, recently dedicated his new born baby. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Geoffrey Ogbonna, did not pick his calls or respond to text messages sent to his mobile line.
