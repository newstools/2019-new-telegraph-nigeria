 F ormer Super Eagles midfielder, Friday Elaho, has rated the quality of play from teams in the Nationwide League One (NLO) Division 2 very high. Elaho, who is the coach of Lagos-based Emmydinho FC, was on the side-lines as his side pummelled Fehinty FC of Osun 5-1 with captain, Omere Kingsley, bagging a hat-trick while Emmanuel Anagor scored a brace. It was a second victory for Emmydinho FC who on Saturday piped Metropolitan FC 1-0. “In the matches I have watched here in Ijebu-Ode, I have seen teams play good football and fantastic goals scored by young and raw talents,” Elaho said in his post-match comments. “The NLO is future of our football and kudos to its managers. A big applause to my team, because we deserved the victory. We watched Fehinty after our game against Metropolitan, spotted their strength and weakness, at the end draw up a game plan which paid off as my players executed the plan well scoring five goals despite conceding one early in the game.” “For Fehinty FC, they are a good side; they started very well in the opening 10 minutes but lacked the cutting edge. “Our fans should expect a good game against Knight FC of Osun as the tie is between two good attacking and goal scoring teams who needs the three points most.” Both Emmydinho FC and Knight FC, who beat Metropolitan FC 4-3, are on six points from two games. “For Fehinty FC, they are a good side, they started very well in the opening  10 minutes but lacked the cutting edge. “Our fans should expect a good game against Knight FC of Osun as the tie is between two good attacking and goal scoring teams who needs the three points most.” Both Emmydinho FC and Knight FC who beat Metropolitan FC 4-3 are on 6pts from two games.
