…part of team that arrested Evans, Boko Haram commanders The three operatives of the Intelligence Response Team (IRT) that were allegedly killed by soldiers during an operation in Taraba State on Wednesday, had taken part in sensitive investigation activities across the country. New Telegraph learnt that the officers were in the team that arrested the notorious kidnap suspect, Chukwudi Onuamadike (alias Evans), who is facing charges bordering on conspiracy to kidnap, kidnapping and attempted murder before a Lagos High Court. The specially-trained operatives, according to findings, were also part of the squad that arrested 22 Boko Haram Terrorists (BHTs) “responsible for the 2014 kidnapping of the Chibok School Girls in Borno State” in 2014. Also to their credit, were the arrest of the “Boko Haram’s overall commander in North Central,  Umar Abdulmalik, and several of his group members”, as well as the rounding up of suspected “kidnappers of the two American and two Canadian citizens in Kaduna State”. Their latest exploits, our correspondent learnt, were the rescue of President Muhammadu Buhari’s District Head, Magajin Garin Daura, in Kano State, and arrest of 13 of his abductors. The District Head of Daura was rescued a month after his abduction on May 1. The Police had accused soldiers of killing the officers, and a civilian, despite “sufficient proof” that the policemen were on a legitimate operation. But, the Army has said that the soldiers involved in the alleged killing were responding to a distress call for the rescue of a kidnap victim.
