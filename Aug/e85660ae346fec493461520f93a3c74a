 Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, yesterday asked the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) to focus on intelligence gathering, since it was not the lead agency in internal security. This was as the former Osun State governor said that one of his fundamental objectives would be to improve internal security. Aregbesola dropped the hint during a familiarisation visit to the headquarters of the NSCDC in Abuja. He said: “Since you are not the lead internal security agency, you must improve your intelligence gathering. The early warning capacity your agency provides to others will help reduce threats. “My emphasis is on early warning part of security that will help sister agencies work better. Rather than being reactive, we will be proactive,” Aregbesola said. Meanwhile, the newly-inaugurated minister had said that the ministry under his watch would key into the policy thrust of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration. Accordingly, he unfolded three focal points, which includes Security, Economic improvement and Transparency (SET), as the operational framework for agencies under the ministry. “We must adopt Buhari’s slogan in the way that it’s best suited for us. So, we will adopt ‘SET’ in this ministry, which means security, economic improvement and transparency,” Aregbesola noted. Earlier, Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Mrs. Georgina Ehuriah, expressed the hope that the minister would deliver on the ‘Next Level’ agenda of the administration.
