The Senator representing Plateau North Senatorial District and Deputy Chairman, Committee on Defence, Istifanus D. Gyang, says Nigerians and governments at all levels must rethink their attitude to the security of the entire nation.  Gyang stated this at the weekend in Jos during the burial of the mother of the Chief Security officer to the former Governor Jonah Jang SP. Dalyop Dung (rtd).  He said every part of the nation requires rapid, sustained and sufficient cover to deal with its emerging security challenges. “Many years ago, the people of Plateau were under the intense pressure of terrorism – villages were invaded and burnt, places of worship were bombed and civilians and even the uniformed forces were killed. But little was done to curtail the situation.  “In fact, many people across the nation thought that this was merely our problem in Plateau State. But look at what we have today – Sokoto, Zamfara, Kaduna, Katsina, the whole of the North East, I mean, places you would never have thought could be affected are all groaning under insurgency. We are not happy to see all these. But what if the situation in Plateau was quickly and efficiently handled? Would we not have contained the situation and prevented it from lasting this long and affecting so many other communities in the country at once? “In fact, if the Plateau situation situation was dealt with at its infancy, it would have given us some significant lessons on being pro-active and effective in security management.”  Senator Gyang appealed to security agencies, the Federal Government and all critical stakeholders involved in the management of the security architecture of the country to rethink the strategy of responding to emerging situations and show greater commitment to securing the nation as a whole.
