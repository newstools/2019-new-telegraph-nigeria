In a bid to achieve sustainable growth in key sectors of the economy in line with the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including agriculture, Nigeria’s first digital agriculture company, Farmcrowdy, has unveiled Crowdyvest, an impact-driven platform that connects individuals to multiple sponsorship opportunities in the country. Speaking at the unveiling ceremony of its new brand in Lagos recently, the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Farmcrowdy and Crowdyvest, Onyeka Akumah, explained that the firm had been repositioned to explore other key opportunities in the economy to achieve an impact-driven business that will stimulate growth and development in the country’s economy, including agriculture. He said that the new platform was launched to foster a broader avenue for economic growth and build a system that will span across Nigeria and the rest of Africa by ensuring that sponsorship opportunities are safe, trusted and secure via its modus operandi. According to him, the new launch will see a successful migration of all the existing sponsors under the Farmcrowdy platform to the Crowdyvest platform without any need to create a fresh account. Akumah stressed that new sponsors would also be able to sign up to a safe, secure and trusted platform for free, adding that every sponsor would continue to safely sponsor farms on the Farmcrowdy platform as well as all other portfolio products and sponsorship opportunities to be launched via the Crowdyvest platform in the future. “We have been able to successfully implement a business model in one of the most challenging sectors in the world, driving growth in agriculture (food and security). With our model, we have connected over 25,000 farmers with access to funding, technical expertise and market access by continuously creating value for them and we now intend to implement this across other sectors of the economy while having a direct impact on the achievement of the United Nation’s SDGs,” he noted. Speaking further on the new brand, the founder explained that the way the firm designed Crowdyvest was different from its digital agric platform-Farmcrowdy, noting that it will not take up an opportunity that is not sellable to the firm’s sponsors.
