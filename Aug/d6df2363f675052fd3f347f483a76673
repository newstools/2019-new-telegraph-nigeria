Liverpool have maintained their 100% start to the new season with a swashbuckling 3-1 victory over Arsenal at Anfield this evening. The hosts took the lead through Joel Matip towards the end of a first half in which Arsenal had chances despite ceding the lion’s share of possession and territory, and then took the game away from their visitors during a dominant second half. Mohamed Salah doubled the advantage from the penalty spot four minutes after the interval and then sealed the points in style with a fine individual effort to ensure Jurgen Klopp’s side are the only team with a perfect record after three league games this season. A first clean sheet of the campaign did elude the European champions as Lucas Torreira came off the bench to score a consolation, but Liverpool were worthy of a club-record-equalling 12th successive league victory to move out on their own at the top of the table. Meanwhile, Patrick Van Aanholt scored a 93rd-minute winner as Crystal Palace recorded a 2-1 victory over Manchester United in Saturday afternoon’s Premier League clash at Old Trafford. Daniel James had cancelled out a first-half Jordan Ayew effort to leave the two teams level in the 89th minute, before Van Aanholt squeezed his strike under David de Gea in the final exchanges as Palace recorded their first ever Premier League win over the Red Devils. Also, Tammy Abraham scored his first two goals for Chelsea on Saturday to hand Frank Lampard a maiden win in charge of the club at the expense of newly-promoted Norwich City. The Canaries equalised twice during a thrilling first half at Carrow Road, with Todd Cantwell cancelling out Abraham’s first before Pukki continued his fine start to the campaign by responding to Mason Mount’s goal. However, Abraham’s second goal with 22 minutes remaining proved to be too much for Norwich to recover from as Chelsea held on for a 3-2 victory which gives them their first win of the campaign at the fourth attempt, reports the BBC.
