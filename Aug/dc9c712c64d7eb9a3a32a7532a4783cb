The Benue State Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Makurdi on Wednesday nullified the election of Mr. David Ogewu of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and declared Samson Okwu of the PDP as winner of the 2019 House of Representatives election for Oju/Obi federal constituency.
Delivering judgment on the petition filed by Okwu against the election of Ogewu,  Chairman of the tribunal, Justice A A Adeleye,  ordered the Independent National Independent Electoral Commssion (INEC) to withdraw the certificate of return issued to Ogewu in error and issue a fresh one to Okwu.
Justice Adeleye also said the returning officer was not supposed to declare Ogewu winner of the Oju/Obi House of Reps election using only Oju results because results for Obi, which had over 59,000 registered voters, had not been released.
Adeleye said the step by step procedure spelt out for collation and declaration of results were not followed by the returning officer and added that the reason of apprehension given for declaration of Oglewu as winner was not backed by any evidence or proof beyond reasonable doubts.
He said after the deduction of 252 votes which had no source from Ogewu’s 12,784 votes in Oju, he had 12,562 votes while Okwu had 6,637 votes in Oju.
According to him, records before the tribunal showed that Okwu had 7, 543 votes in Obi while Ogewu had 874 votes.
He said the allegation that the election was marred by irregularities was not proved as no PDP member nor thug was mentioned in connection with the disruption of elections.
He said votes scored by Okwu in Oju and Obi was 14, 300 while Ogewu’s had 13,306 in both Oju and Obi.
