Following consistent reports of rising water level in the Kaduna River, the state Ministry of Environment and the Kaduna Environmental Protection Authority (KEPA) yesterday warned residents living close to the river to immediately relocate.  They also called on residents to desist from dumping waste in the drainage and cooperate with government agencies. A statement issued by the state’s Commissioner of Environment, Ibrahim Husseini, said: “It’s drawing the attention of residents living close to river Kaduna and other flood-prone areas to temporarily relocate to safer areas.  “Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) have predicted that Kaduna and other states of the country may experience floods as water levels in River Niger and Benue have continued to rise since the month of July.  “Residents are advised to desist from dumping refuse and waste materials in water ways and drainages, instead they should imbibe the habit of clearing gutters and drainages in their communities to guard against floods. Communities are also advised to cooperate with all relevant government agencies.”
