The impeachment process against the embattled Kogi State Deputy Governor Simon Achuba has heated-up as the state House of Assembly has called on the state Chief Judge, Justice Nasir Ajanah to constitute a seven-man panel of inquiry to investigate allegations of gross misconduct levelled against him.  The House had earlier issued a notice of allegations to the Deputy Governor two weeks ago.  Presenting the motion at the floor of the House, the Majority Leader, Abdullahi Bello Balogun (APC-Ajaokuta) called for investigation into the allegations which will serve as second step towards impeachment of the of Achuba.  He explained that the Deputy Governor evaded service of the Notice of Allegations on him and also directed that none of his aides should receive any correspondence from the House of Assembly on his behalf.  Balogun said the prayers calling for investigation in the motion were in line with Section 188(3) that the House should resolve by motion supported by not less than two-third of members to request the Chief Judge to set up the seven-man panel to investigate the allegations.
