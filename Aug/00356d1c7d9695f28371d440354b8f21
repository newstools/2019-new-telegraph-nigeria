The Lagos State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has commended Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for including the party’s state spokesman, Engr. Joe Igbokwe and other tested party men in his additional list of commissioner and Special Adviser nominees.  Speaking in Lagos, the party’s Assistant Publicity Secretary, Hon. Abiodun Salami, also commended the governor for deeming it fit to include members of Lagos APC executive in his cabinet.  It would be recalled that Igbokwe, the Lagos APC Publicity Secretary, was among the 13 commissioners and special advisers nominees announced by the governor on Tuesday. And prior to the latest list, two members of the Lagos APC executive – Dr. Wale Ahmed (Secretary) and Mrs. Toke Benson-Awoyinka (Assistant Legal Adviser) were also among the 25 people earlier released by the governor and screened by the Lagos State House of Assembly.  Salami described the second list as a perfect blend of tested politicians and competent professionals.  His words: “It is a welcome development to see those who have participated actively in the party being part of the State Executive Council as commissioners and special advisers. The appointments will help the governor and the state government to enhance the manifestoes of the party.  “Having members of the party’s executive in Governor Sanwo-Olu’s cabinet will help the government to implement the ideology of the party. We commend the governor for giving us a perfect mix of technocrats and professionals on the new list.”
