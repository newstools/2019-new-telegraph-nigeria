Super Eagles winger, Samuel Kalu, has been named in the European Top five league team of the week for players under the age of 21 following his impressive display for Bordeaux against Montpellier. The 21-year-old, who was on from start to finish showed plenty of strength on the wings as he was a constant threat to the Montpellier defenders. That performance earned him a spot on the whoscored best XI alongside teammate and Josh Maja who remains eligible to play for Nigeria whilst Eagles poster boy Samuel Chukwueze narrowly missed out on the cut despite his goal scoring performance for Villarreal against Granada. “Kalu completes the XI and joins teammate Josh Maja in the team. Unlike Maja, Kalu started against Montpellier and completed 90 minutes. The 21-year-old finished the match as the WhoScored Man of the Match after completing eight dribbles, winning four fouls and attempting two shots. Kalu also made two interceptions and won two aerial duels,” Whoscored wrote about the Nigerian.
