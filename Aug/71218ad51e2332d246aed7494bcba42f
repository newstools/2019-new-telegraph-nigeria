Cristiano Ronaldo has said that ‘2018 was the most difficult year on a personal level’ after facing rape allegations. The Juventus star was accused last September by former model Kathryn Mayorga, 34, of carrying out a sex attack at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009. The case was dismissed in a Nevada court in June after a voluntary dismissal by Mayorga, though the filing did not say if Ronaldo had agreed a settlement. He denies the accusation, although he has reportedly acknowledged that he paid Mayorga in an earlier settlement. Speaking to Italian TV last night he said: “When people question your honour, it hurts. It hurts a lot mainly because I have a big family, a wife and an intelligent child who understands a lot of things. “This is a case I’m not comfortable expressing myself on. But once again, my innocence has been proven. It makes me proud.” In a statement earlier this year, Ronaldo’s lawyer Peter Christiansen said: “Mr Ronaldo has always maintained, as he does today, that what occurred in Las Vegas in 2009 was consensual in nature, so it is not surprising that DNA would be present, nor that the police would make this very standard request as part of their investigation.” Ronaldo’s lawyers have said the non-disclosure agreement signed with the former model was “by no means a confession of guilt.” Mayorga’s attorney previously said the model agreed to an out-of-court settlement to keep her name from going public, but was inspired to speak out by the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment. *Courtesy: metro.co.uk
