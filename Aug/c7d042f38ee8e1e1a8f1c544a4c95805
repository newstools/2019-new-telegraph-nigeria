The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said  time has come for peace to return to its Lagos State chapter, which has been in crisis for quite sometime.  The party also declared that the state is “winnable” for party for members could put their differences aside.  PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, who spoke on Tuesday when he received the report of three-man ad hoc committee on the resolution of the crisis in the Lagos State chapter, reminded party members in the state that there is time for everything.
“All we want is peace, all we want is to win Lagos.  “And for our members in Lagos, the bible says there is time for everything. We have had enough crisis, the time has come for peace. We need everybody to make the difference,” Secondus demanded.  The National Chairman, who reacted immediately to one of the recommendations of the committee, assured that there would be no interference in the running of the state chapter by the National Working Committee (NWC).
