Legendary singer, Elton John, has hit a major milestone in his long journey to sobriety, with the 72-year old singer celebrating abstaining from alcohol or drugs for a massive 29 years.   While sharing a photo of his Alcoholics Anonymous sobriety coin to mark the occasion on social media, Elton John wrote a touching yet reflective post on what the date means to him along the coin bearing AA’s mottos of “Unity, Service, and Recovery,” as well as one of the organisation’s common sayings: “To thine own self be true.” “29 years ago today, I was a broken man.  I finally summoned up the courage to say three words that would change my life: “I need help”.   Thank-you to all the selfless people who have helped me on my journey through sobriety. I am eternally grateful,” he wrote.
