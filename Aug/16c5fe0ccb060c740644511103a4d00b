Worried by the negative impact of global warming, the Lagos State Government has warned that it would henceforth begin prosecution of any property owner who fells a tree without approval from the relevant authorities.   Hence, the state government has sealed off a building at 10A, Alexander Road, Ikoyi for felling trees, accusing the property owner of contravening the Greening Law of the state by felling of trees without the appropriate permit.   Speaking the during the sealing  of the property by the enforcement teams of the Lagos State  Park and Garden (LASPARK) and the Lagos State Enforcement Agency (LASEPA) the General Manger LASPARK, Mrs Bilikiss Adebiyi Abiola, said  that the government would not hesitate to sanction without any waiver.   She described the action as an enforcement of the executive order declared by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, saying that sealing was enforced after the property owner refused to comply with the abatement notice earlier served to him by LASPARK.   She said: “This building was sealed for infringing on the established law after the owner cut down trees without approval by the government. This act contravenes the provisions of the Greening Law and as such attracts legal action”.   According to the LASPARK boss, the state government is committing a lot of resources for the expansion and maintenance of its greening project across the state, adding that what is expected from anyone or institution is to support the mission and not to act contrarily, to the point of sabotaging its efforts.
