Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) at the weekend refuted claims in some quarters that it was deliberately denying the people of Niger State electricity supply, saying that; “We can only give what we have.” The rebuttal came on the heels of various protests and calls from various quarters on the need for improved power supply in the state. While responding to questions after delivering his lecture, the keynote speaker at the launch of Power Update Magazine and Corporate Manager, AEDC, Mr. Fadipe Oyebode, said instability in the national grid had been responsible for the power challenge.
According to Oyebode, who spoke on; The Media, Nigeria Electricity Supply Industry (NESI), at the weekend in Minna, the AEDC was mindful of its customers’ safety and satisfaction. According to him, “Our desire is to see that every part of our franchise area is attended to. We have had instability in the grid and it is responsible for the power challenges we have in Niger State. “There is no deliberate policy to deny Niger State of electricity. Whatever is coming to Niger State is a function of what we have. The quantum we get is what we give out.”  He added that the population of the country was growing at a rapid rate, but that the funds available for the turnaround of the power sector was not coming at the same place. According to him, “We need to know that the power sector is highly and very capital intensive. On the issue of cost reflective tariff, sometime last year, we entered into an agreement for the supply of metres to the tune of N10 billion, just one item and we were not able to provide up to three hundred thousand pieces of metres not to talk of transformers, cables, vehicles, staff salaries and so on.” He further charged consumers of electricity in the country to be accountable and responsible in their dealings with AEDC.
