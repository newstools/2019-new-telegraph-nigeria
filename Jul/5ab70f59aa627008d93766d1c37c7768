A member of the National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) in Ede, Osun State, Miss Ayomide Juliana, has died after allegedly dousing her hair with the popular insecticide, Sniperm in an attempt to eliminate lice.
According to sources, Juliana decided to douse her hair with Sniper following discovery that lice had invaded her hair and was terribly itching her. The development threw her colleagues into a state of mourning as they reportedly wept uncontrollably.
Investigations revealed that the deceased, whose place of abode and primary assignment, were yet unknown at press time, contracted the lice from a salon.
Juliana, after reaching home from the salon, started itching and scratching her head. When the itch didn’t abate, she used hard objects. She, however, later died after applying the insecticide to her hair, which turned out to be too harmful and dangerous for human head.
It was learnt that after the application of the Sniper, Juliana covered her hair with a cap and slept off. She was later discovered the next day, unconscious in her bed.
Residents rushed her to an undisclosed hospital, where all efforts to revive her proved abortive.
The state Head of Information Unit of NYSC, Mrs. Funmilayo Okundaye, confirmed the story.
She said: “We got to know of the incident at the camp today. We have got across to the deceased’s family.”
Okundaye, however, promised that NYSC would do all it could, to ensure that Juliana was given a befitting burial. She also commiserated with the victim’s family.
