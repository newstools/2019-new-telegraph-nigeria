Senator representing Adamawa North Senatorial District, Elisha Abbo, had a session with operatives at the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police Command Headquarters, yesterday.
The lawmaker was seen in a video assaulting a woman at a sex toy shop in Abuja.
The video, which went viral on the social media, had attracted condemnation from individuals and groups, many of who had called for his immediate arrest and prosecution, where culpability was established.
Accordingly, the Inspector General of Police (IG), Mr. Mohammed Adamu, ordered an investigation into the ugly incident.
It was learnt that Abbo had visited the IG at the Force Headquarters, before proceeding to the FCT Police Command, for possible interview.
It was, however, not clear when the interaction with detectives would be concluded.
The outrage generated by Abboâ€™s violent conduct, as seen in the video, had forced him to make public apology.
