A37-year-old night guard, Wasiu Orilonise, stunned the audience at an Ibadan Chief Magistrates’ Court, Iwo Road, Oyo State, yesterday, when he said he defiled his 15-year-old daughter to protect her. The accused, who was arraigned on a one-court charge of having canal knowledge of his daughter, in the charge marked No. Mi/271c/2019, committed the alleged offence in December 2018, at Omo village, Agbofieti, Ibadan, in the Ibadan magisterial district. The prosecutor, Mr. Sunday Ogunremi, said Wasiu “did rape his daughter (name withheld) without her consent, an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 34, Sub-sections 1 and 2 of the Child Rights Law of Oyo State of Nigeria, 2006”. His plea was declined during the arraignment and he was promptly ordered to be remanded in prison custody. When the Chief Magistrate, Mr. Taiwo Olaniran, sought to know from the accused what could have pushed him into defiling his biological daughter, Orilonise said that since he lost his wife a few years ago, he had been taking care of Adenike and her other siblings but that he committed the act in an attempt to protect her. He said the incident occurred as he was trying to ascertain if Adenike had lost her virginity, but that upon discovering that his daughter was still intact, he started having sex regularly with her both in the morning before she would leave for school and at night. The magistrate berated the fathers who are fond of sexually abusing their daughters and other under-aged girls, saying they were only allowing the devil to use them to destroy the society. After ordering the accused to be remanded in Agodi Prison pending legal advice from the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), the magistrate adjourned the matter till July 30, 2019 for mention.
