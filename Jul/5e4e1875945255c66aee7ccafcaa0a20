 O fe Nsala (Nsala Soup) is a delicious soup, popular in the eastern part of Nigeria. It is also known as ‘white soup’ because of the absence of palm oil. Nsala Soup with cat fish is perfect for a cold rainy day due to its spicy taste.  Ingredients   • Cat Fish  • Fresh or dry Utazi Leaves • Thickener: few pieces of raw white yam • Habanero peppers to taste  • Salt • Handful of crayfish  • Dry fish • Stock fish • Stock cubes  • Ogiri Okpei (Nigerian traditional seasoning) • Cow leg, Ponmo, beef (optional) Cooking directions  • Boil a few cubes of raw white yam. When soft, pound with a mortar and pestle till a smooth paste is formed, then set aside. You can substitute white yam with yam powder or potato puree for the thickening. • Wash and pound/blend the utazi leaves, the chilli pepper and the crayfish and set aside. Utazi is bitter in taste and only used for flavouring so one or two leaves should be enough especially when using the fresh leaves. • Place the catfish in a pot and pour enough water to cover the fish. Add the seasoning. Feel free to add already cooked beef, cow leg or ponmo and dry fish to this soup recipe. • When the catfish is almost done, add the crayfish, pepper and utazi leaves blend. Also add the yam paste in small lumps and salt to taste.
