Former Super Eagles goal tender, Ike Shorunmu, has told the Nigeria Football Federation NFF to concentrate more on the country’s Nigeria Professional Football League if it wants to churn out a better senior national in future. The former Stationery Stores and Shooting Stars goalkeeper said by doing so, the home-based players would have the opportunity for positions with the foreign-based ones. Shorunmu said such system worked well in the days of Father Tiko and Clemens Westerhof when players were only release on weekend from the national team camp to play for their various clubs. He said: “In most cases, they take whatever they learnt from the national camp to their clubsides at weekends.  The national team was doing well that time because the players train together and easily found it easy to play well for the national team,” he said. “We need to work more on our league, if our league is still the same the way we have been running before, things would have been better. When the foreign-based were invited to the camp, they believe they will just stroll into the camp and pick up jerseys. “But if there is a competition for the home-based, they will know they need to fight for jerseys right from preparation.” Speaking on the way forward for a better Super Eagles, Shorunmu said all that was needed by the coaching crew is knowing when to take professional risk like the Super Eagles team that conquered Africa back in 2013.
