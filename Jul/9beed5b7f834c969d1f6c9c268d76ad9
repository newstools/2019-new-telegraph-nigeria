At least four people were killed yesterday while many others were wounded when gunmen invaded Kera community, Tongov in Katsina-Ala Local Government Area of Benue State. The gunmen, who invaded the community on a motorcycle at midnight when residents were sleeping, carried out a house-to-house attack and killed innocent people. Scores of the people, including women and children, who fled the area, are said to be taking refuge in the nearby Ugba, Gondozua and other villages considered to be safe. A witness, Jerry Iorngaem, said the killers “came last night around midnight on a Bajaj motorcycle. “They woke up the victims at night and as they opened their doors, the gunmen shot and killed them. “Four people were killed and they also destroyed more than 1,000 tubers of yam kept in the barn of one of the deceased house.” Kera is on the border between Logo and Katsina-Ala local government areas. It was learnt that policemen were drafted to the affected areas to maintain peace. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Sewuese Anene, said she was yet to get the information about the killing when our correspondent called her for details.
