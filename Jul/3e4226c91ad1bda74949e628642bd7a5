As far as Nollywood actress, Kate Henshaw, is concerned, the apology offered by Senator Elisha Abbo after assaulting a woman in an Abuja sex shop was insincere.  The 47-year-old Roti actress delivered a rebuke to the senator on Twitter, writing: “Your supposed apology smacks of arrogance, Elisha Abbo! You said ‘no matter what she did to me’, what did she do except tell you to take it easy. “Your supposed apology is very insincere!!! You first lied when the video came out,” she wrote.  The video of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lawmaker from Adamawa state hitting the lady was posted online on Tuesday by Premium Times, leading to calls by Amnesty International and other rights group calling for his arrest and persecution.  His party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, also condemned his action, with the police and Senate launching an investigation.
