For somebody traveling to Egypt for the first, you may be tempted to believe that as a Muslim country, Egyptians women will deck in hijab, niqab and even burka which are different kinds of coverings worn by Muslim women all over the world.
However, such perception will disappear when you get here; Egyptians appear to be some of the most stylish and fashionable on the continent of Africa.
Most women always look so trendy; although Arabs, many of their women have incredible shapes which they accentuate with their lovely wears.
Although hijab is a kind of veil worn by Muslim women, they have turned it into something like fashion accessories here as most of them use scarfs to cover their heads in a more stylish way.
They wear all kinds of western world wears including jeans (most of the time crazy jeans), T-shirts, sexy gowns, tights, joggers.
Donâ€™t expect to see their men in a long jalamia; I am yet to see a youth in that kind of dress since I got here. Even their old ones prefer to deck in pairs of jeans, good shirts or T-shirts.
I now regularly visit their markets, clothes and clothing materials are some of the fastest-selling commodities.
