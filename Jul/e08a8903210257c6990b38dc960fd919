The family of Adasu Jimin of Tse- Agberagba, the headquarters of Konshisha Local Government Area of Benue State was on Tuesday thrown into mourning as one of them identified as Kula Adasu allegedly committed suicide.  New Telegraph learnt that, the family members had accused the deceased of being responsible for the tragic death of one Terseer Gyuve Adasu who died in Makurdi the state capital earlier this month and is to be buried next week Monday. A source from the local government, who did not want his name in print, confided in New Telegraph that “the matter became dicey when the family held a meeting and insisted they would consult a soothsayer today and for fear of been exposed, the deceased decided to commit suicide. “He killed himself to end the raging problem that he was the one who killed the young man.” The source said late Kula Adasu, who is within his early 50’s, was married with children and did not leave any suicide note stating reason for his action. Benue State Police Command’s Public Relations Officer, DSP Catherine Anene confirmed the incident.  She simply said: “We have received the report and we are handling it.”
