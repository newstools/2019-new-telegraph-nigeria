Kebbi State Government has apprehended a truck carrying 460 bags of adulterated fertilizers to Birnin Kebbi, the state capital. The arrests were made yesterday by the security agencies while the adulterated fertilizers had been handed over to the state’s Ministry of Agriculture for laboratory confirmation test. Confirming the incident to newsmen yesterday in his office, Acting Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Mohammed Lawal She’ahu Arugungu, said the arrests were made by a po-lice patrol team along the Birnin Kebbi bypass with the suspects of the adulterated fertilizers, called NPK 20-10-10, now in custody. “After we discovered that the bags of fertilizers were adulterated, we handed them over to the police for further investigation, they are four in number including the driver and they are in the hands of the security men for more information,” he added. The Permanent Secretary, who emphasised that the fertilizers could kill people after the harvest of the farm produce, appealed to the people to be conscious of the fertilizers they use for farming.
