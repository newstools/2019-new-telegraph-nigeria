Fans should expect a lot of fireworks this evening as the four best teams on the African continent square up against each other with their eyes on the ultimate prize of a place in Friday’s Nations Cup final, reports Tunde Sulaiman    Three weeks to the day that the inaugural expanded African Cup of Nations kicked off with 24 teams, the continents showpiece football event for national teams is now down to just four.  When the Confederation of African Football (CAF) decided to increase the number of teams taking part in the 32nd edition of the tournament, which was also holding for the first time in summer in deference to the European clubs, quite a lot of fans may have wondered if the decision would not dilute the standard of the competition.  Whilst question marks still remain over the standard, what cannot be debated is the fact that the hosts Egypt have provided an impressive competition and pre-tournament fears over security have largely remained just that – fears.  Considering the fact that the Land of the Pharaohs were last minute hosts after CAF stripped original hosts, Cameroon of the rights because they were unable to meet the necessary deadlines, Egypt did justify the faith the African football governing body had in their organisational abilities by so far putting up a flawless competition.  But away from the politics of the game, on the field of play, the tournament will also be remembered for the number of upsets recorded and the fairytale run of the Barea of Madagascar, which in taking part in their first ever Nations Cup finals left a lasting impression with their fearless approach to the game, which saw them stunning more illustrious sides including three-time champions, Nigeria in the group stage and then DR Congo in the Round of 16.  And although the wheels finally came off their campaign in the quarter-finals against Tunisia, the players of the Indian Ocean island nation will still return as national heroes.  But now the business end of the tournament comes up today with the semi-finals where the continent’s four best teams – Nigeria, Algeria, Tunisia and Senegal – square up to determine which two of them will have the honour of playing the flagship game of the competition in Friday’s final taking place at the giant 75,000-seater Cairo International Stadium.  Although when the competition kicked off last month Nigeria was not considered to be one of the favourites by many of the bookies, who placed their bets on Senegal and the host nation, Egypt, the Eagles appeared to confirm their “minnows” status by the experts when they unexpectedly lost to low rank outsiders, Madagascar in their final Group B game.  And the victory of the team ranked 23 places below the Eagles in Africa was no fluke as they completely deserved their win often playing the three-time Nations Cup champions off the park.  Explaining the loss to the Barea, which ended Nigeria’s nine-game unbeaten run dating back to 2010, Gernot Rohr, while acknowledging that the third ranked African team had played below par, however, also stated that the Barea are also a good team and there was nothing to be ashamed of, losing to the team that first secured qualification for AFCON in 2019.  In his assessment of the team’s display, Rohr said his players were ‘relaxed’ but he was not surprised by the result.  “We lost to a good team because Madagascar was the first to qualify for the tournament and there is no shame in losing to such a team,” Rohr said in his post-match interview.  “Madagascar was the better team today (Sunday). We started with giving them a gift and after, we could not find a solution. We made five changes because we wanted to give a rest to some players and also preserve those with cards.  “Sometimes it happens when you are already qualified; the players are relaxed and playing easy.” The German, who recently turned 66, also promised that Nigerians would see a different Super Eagles on display when they squared against champions, Cameroon in the Round of 16, which their loss to the Barea had consigned them. However, many fans did not share his optimism fearful of the damage the Indomitable Lions had often inflicted on Nigeria in previous meetings, which included three defeats in Nations Cup final games in 1984 (Cote d’Ivoire), 1988 (Morocco) and 2000 (Ghana/Nigeria).  But his wards were to come to the table on the day and despite slipping behind after taking the lead first; still showed a previously unseen grit and determination in turning the game around and ending the reign of the champions courtesy of a 3-2 victory to set up last Wednesday’s quarter-final showdown with the Bafana Bafana of South Africa.  Naturally following the win over the Lions, Rohr mouthed all the right words insisting that the Madagascar defeat had motivated his wards.  Reacting after the game, Rohr said his team couldn’t wait to make up for their embarrassing performance in the game against Madagascar.  “I know my team and I know that since last Sunday they want to really do well and win for all the players who made some mistakes,” the manager told the media after the 3-2 win over the Indomitable Lions. “We lost the game we never had to lose against Madagascar, but it was a lesson of humility and also the motivation to do really well [against Cameroon].  “We wanted to finish first in the group but we could not. The most important for us was to win this match of the last 16. It happened when I was in Gabon, we won the three matches as host country and we lost in the quarterfinals after 120 minutes via penalties. So sometimes it’s better to have one loss in the group stage and then win in the knockout games.”  Speaking further, Rohr, who came under severe criticism following Nigeria’s unimpressive showing in the group stage, stated that his players showed signs of belief in a comeback during the half-time break.  “I have a team with good spirit and good solidarity. Even in half-time when the moment was difficult, I saw that we could still believe in it. Because in the first half, we were the better team, but we conceded those two goals in the end of the first-half and so we had to be very strong mentally to come back in the match.  “The beginning of the second half was not so easy, but then, we came back. And I think physical fitness helped us also.  “We had two days more to prepare for the match. We could stay in Alexandria in this nice place, with a good climate not so hot like Cairo, and this could help us also,” Rohr stated.  Incidentally, what now added spice to the Eagles’ quarter-final clash against the 1996 Nations Cup winners, was the fact that they had taken out one of the tournament’s favourites and hosts of the competition, Egypt in the Round of 16.  The victory over the eighth-ranked Pharaohs immediately gave the 14th ranked South Africans a massive boost especially as before the encounter with Egypt, Stuart Baxter’s side had underperformed.  Although Nigeria did eventually triumph over the South Africans 2-1, Bafana Bafana did give the West Africans a good run for their money, especially in the second half of the encounter, which saw them drawing level in the 68th minute courtesy of a powerful Bongani Zungu header that gave Daniel Akpeyi no chance.  During his interaction with the media after the game Rohr said: “The support from the home (Egypt) fans was fantastic. They were fantastic all through the game, but my players also showed good attitude and we played very well especially in the first half which also gave them something to cheer about. I hope they continue to support us in the tournament.  “The support was great, it is normal for them to support us after South Africa removed Egypt from the competition.  “We knew facing South Africa will be very difficult for us. They gave us a good fight, but we were lucky to score in the final minutes.  Ironically, the Super Eagles lost 2-0 at home to the Bafana Bafana in the qualifiers and Rohr admitted the result had a positive effect on his side.  “It helped us change a lot of things and also refocus. We were able to beat Cameroon 4-0 during the World Cup qualifiers and have only lost to African opposition twice since then. I have to say thank you to Stuart Baxter for that,” he added.  “We had a plan and we knew South Africa would find it hard to replicate their performance against Egypt, so we had a slight advantage. We are happy with the win and now we must recover in time for our next opponents.”  And recover they must because in the Desert Warriors the Eagles will not be able to show any fatigue or complacency against a side ranked 12th in Africa, nine places below the West Africans.  Though on paper the game may be tilted slightly in favour of the North Africans, who have played arguably the best football in Egypt, but the Eagles do have a very impressive pedigree at the Nations Cup.  In 18 appearances in the continent’s showpiece football spectacle, the Eagles have made it to 15 semi-finals; reaching the final on seven of these occasions.  But if there is any team on the continent that has given the Eagles problems, then it is today’s foes. In 19 previous encounters between the two, Nigeria has managed nine wins to the Warriors’ seven with the others ending in draws.  Under the tutelage of Coach Djamel Belmadi the Warriors have been one of the most impressive sides of the competition and boast a rock-solid defence, which was only finally breached in the quarter-final penalty shootout win over the Elephants of Cote d’Ivoire after they had played 1-1 in regulation and extra time.  Manchester City’s Riyad Mahrez has already scored twice at Egypt 2019 and would love nothing more than to help his side end their poor Nations Cup record which has seen the Warriors only win once – way back in 1990 when they hosted. Incidentally it was the Super Eagles that they beat on that day.  But Rohr also has his own jokers to call on in Odion Ighalo, who already has three goals to his name, Alex Iwobi, Ahmed Musa, whose pace posed all sorts of problems for the South African defence, and new kid on the block, Samuel Chukwueze, who scored the opening goal against the Bafana Bafana.  A closely fought tussle between the two is expected with the winner likely to be the side whose players want victory more.  So can the Eagles make it final number eight? That is the billion naira question which millions of their countrymen and women will be praying they do today.  In the second semi-final, the continent’s top ranked team, Senegal goes up against the second ranked side, Tunisia as the West Africa versus North Africa rivalry kicks off the last four clashes at 5pm.  The Teranga Lions have so far failed to show the stuff that have made them the top side on the continent although they have still been able to get the job done as their semi-final appearance obviously shows.  Their star man, Sadio Mane has lived up to his billing with three goals so far scored and the Liverpool man will love nothing better than to crown his amazing season, which has seen him win the Champions League, by guiding his side to their first ever Nations Cup crown.  Standing in his way, however, are the Carthage Eagles, which reached their first Africa Cup of Nations semi-final since when they hosted and won it in 2004.  Tunisia may have barely made it out of Group E after managing only three points (courtesy of three draws) to finish second behind Mali, but since then they have been on a roll beating the Black Stars of Ghana (via penalties) in the Round of 16 and then ending the fairytale run of Madagascar 3-0 in the quarter-finals.  While the Barea are definitely not in the same class as the Teranga Lions, however, for the North Africans there is nothing wrong in dreaming of adding another scalp to their collection.   <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-227670" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/HEAD-TO-HEAD-NIG-V-ALG.png?resize=211%2C300&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="211" height="300" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/HEAD-TO-HEAD-NIG-V-ALG.png?resize=211%2C300&amp;ssl=1 211w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/HEAD-TO-HEAD-NIG-V-ALG.png?w=468&amp;ssl=1 468w" sizes="(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px" data-recalc-dims="1">
