President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, requested the Senate to confirm the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Mohammed Tanko, as substantive CJN. The request was contained in the letter which he addressed to the President of the Senate, Senator Ahmad Lawan, which he read on the floor of the Chamber during plenary session. In his letter, President Buhari explained that his request was in line with the provisions of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). While reading the letter, Lawan noted that the President relied on power conferred on him by Section 231 (4) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) to forward the nomination. The National Judicial Council had on Wednesday recommended Justice Tanko to President Buhari for appointment as substantive CJN. Justice Muhammad was sworn in by President Buhari following the suspension of Justice Walter Onnoghen as CJN January 25, 2019Â  by the President on the order of the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT).
