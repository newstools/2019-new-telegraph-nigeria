 O fficials of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibadan zonal office, yesterday arrested 15 suspected ‘Yahoo Boys’ in Ibadan, Oyo State.   The operatives also recovered two exotic cars and phones from the suspects.   The officials also foiled an attempt by one of the suspected Internet fraudsters to flush his phone through a water closet to foreclose access to potentially-incriminating data about him.   The 20-year-old suspect, Fisayo Falade, was one the 15 young men arrested in Ibadan for Internet-related crimes when the operatives conducted a raid on two locations in the ancient city.    Ten of the suspects were arrested at Akatanpa Powerline, while the other five were nabbed at Kushenla area of Ibadan, Oyo State.  Ranging between the ages of 20 and 28 years, the suspects were allegedly hiding behind fake names and identities to perpetrate fraud, dispossessing their unsuspecting victims of their hard-earned money.  Their alleged involvement in Internet-related frauds was reported to the EFCC by members of their neighbourhood, who noticed their expensive ways of life even though they are supposedly undergraduates, without any known source of income. Items recovered from them included two exotic cars, laptops, mobile phones and several false documents. However, the commission refused to disclose their names.   EFCC said the suspects would be charged to court as soon as investigations were concluded.
