 I t’s often said that the first time you meet someone, you’re evaluated on a number of factors but it centres on three main things: your hair, clothes and your shoes. Shoes can either say if you should be taken seriously or not.  Shopping for shoes can be overwhelming; especially as there are different shoe styles seen in shops and stalls.  Keep calm as we narrow it down to five basic essentials every man needs to have in his wardrobe.  • Suede Bucks- they can be used for weddings and look pretty good with a cotton suit.  • Brogues- they are called the perfect business casual shoe, ideal for formal settings, can be worn on suits, don’t wear on baggy trousers. They come in different types of lacing system: Oxfords, Derby, Monk straps and Slip on.  • Loafers- a must in your wardrobe; try not to wear socks with your shoes, as it keeps it stylish and cooler during hot weather.  • Sneakers- they could be canvas, trainers or plimsoll. They are comfortable, ideal for sports, taking a stroll or hitting the club, they give out a chilled look.  • Moccasin or driving shoes- a must have for every man, it can be used with shorts, jeans, native wears, and chinos, and it could be used without socks.
