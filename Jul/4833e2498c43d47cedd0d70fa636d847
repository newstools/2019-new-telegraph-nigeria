*As Fire Service fails to answer emergency calls Okegwo Kenechukwu, Onitsha  After waiting for several hours for the men of the Anambra State Fire Service to help attend to a fire outbreak at a two-storey building at No. 21 Anazonwu Street Odaokpu, Onitsha, frustrated residents of the area and sympathizers resorted to using sachet water (‘pure water’) tackle the blaze. People, numbering over 1000, continued to throw the sachet water at the roof of the building until they were able to reduce the flames. The two-storey building was engulfed in fire at about 1:30pm when the occupants had gone to the market and their offices. Although the exact cause of the fire was not immediately ascertained, but some residents told Sunday Telegraph that an electrical fault was the culprit. However, no life was lost during the inferno that lasted for about one hour. The Divisional Police Officer, Central Police Station, Onitsha and his team were seen at the scene to ensure the safety of lives and property. Although the fire completely burnt the top roof of the building, it was, however, prevented from spreading to other nearby buildings by the efforts of the sympathisers. Some of the sympathisers, who made several distress calls to the Onitsha Fire Service, called on the Governor of Anambra State to immediately set up panel of enquiry to look into the operations of the state fire service. Goods and properties worth millions of naira might have been saved had the fire service showed up to tackle the inferno.
