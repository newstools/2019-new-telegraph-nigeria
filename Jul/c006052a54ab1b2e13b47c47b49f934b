Airtel Africa shares will be listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange on Tuesday, the bourse said, after it postponed the $4.4 billion listing last week. The secondary listing had been planned for July 5. However, the stock exchange postponed it to ensure the telecoms company met its requirements. Indiaâ€™s Bharti Airtel two weeks ago offered shares in its African unit via a London IPO and said it would dual list in Nigeria, its biggest market in Africa, reports Reuters.
