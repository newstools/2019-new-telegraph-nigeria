 Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila yesterday released the names of chairmen and deputy chairmen of 105 special and standing committees, assigning his close loyalists to grade A, otherwise called juicy committees. Out of the 105 committees, he allocated 80 to the All Progressives Congress (APC); 21 to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); two to the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), and one each to Action Alliance (AA) and Allied People’s Movement (APM).
