The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) has announced the donation of N20 million to support initiatives focused on promoting early detection as well as increasing awareness and advocacy for cancer-related causes in Nigeria. The donation is in line with its longstanding commitment to reduce the scourge of cancer in Nigeria. The donation was made known to participants at the 2019 edition of the annual NSE Corporate Challenge by Oscar Onyema, Chief Executive Officer, NSE. Commenting on the development, Onyema expressed delight at the donation. He said: “We are pleased to have hosted a very successful 6th edition of the NSE Corporate Challenge, which recorded over 800 people in attendance. “In addition to the total proceeds from previous editions, the exchange has committed to donate a sum of N20 million to scale up impact in screening and early detection of cancer. These funds will be channeled for the implementation of specific cancer-focused projects in partnership with technical partners. “Since the launch of the NSE’s cancer awareness and fundraising campaign in 2014, a total of N63 million has been raised through sponsorship and participation. We are pleased that NSE Corporate Challenge has grown into a signature cancer advocacy and fundraising event that many institutions are fast associating with to contribute their quota in raising awareness and funds to fight cancer.” The donation by NSE will be used to bolster ongoing efforts by NSE’s technical partners to improve access to cancer supportive services and increase access for those in underserved communities to qualitative cancer consultation regardless of their level of health insurance or ability to pay.
