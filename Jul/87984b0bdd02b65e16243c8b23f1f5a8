Theresa May is taking MPs’ questions for the final time before Boris Johnson becomes Prime Minister. She told them she would continue as a constituency MP and was happy to hand over to a successor committed to delivering Brexit and creating “a bright future for this country”. Later, she will deliver a farewell speech in Downing Street before Johnson takes power. He will speak outside No 10 then begin announcing senior cabinet posts. Johnson is expected to use the opportunity to increase the number of women in full cabinet positions and boost the representation of ethnic minorities – sources say his top team will reflect “modern Britain”. At PMQs, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn paid tribute to Mrs May’s “respect for public service”, but criticised her record on the economy, homelessness and Brexit. He asked whether she would consider joining him “in opposing the reckless plans of her successor”. She, in reply, listed what she felt were her achievements, including school improvements, more employment and greater home ownership. “At its heart, politics isn’t about exchanges across these despatch boxes, nor about eloquent speeches or media headlines,” she added. “It is about the difference we make every day to the lives of people up and down this country.” Former London mayor Johnson won a decisive victory over Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt in a ballot of Tory members – gaining a 66.4% total share of the vote, reports the BBC. Conversations are said to be “ongoing” between Hunt and Johnson about the Foreign Secretary’s next role.
