Nigeria’s population data is a cancerous open sore, only truth will heal it! It is an ever present problem in Nigeria. Those who benefit from it, want the sore to fester, more like flies feasting on rotten carcass of a pig in spite of its odiousness. Those who are victims, and therefore losers want the cancerous sore cured, and extirpated from the body politic. As said earlier, Nigeria’s population data was part of the birth process of Nigeria. Of course, after the birth of Nigeria in 1914 as an amalgamated entity, the midwife/ creator of Nigeria, Britain and its colonial officials set to erect governance infrastructure. One of the key structural ramparts upon which Nigeria’s existence and development hinge on is the census data. It was essential for governance especially for taxation, socio-political and economic planning Britain thought otherwise by using it as an instrument of political control. The first census exercise was conducted in 1916, barely two years after the amalgamation in 1914. The result of the exercise showed that the former Northern and southern protectorates were nearly equal in population. The exercise was repeated in 1921/22, 1931/32 with almost the same result. Thus, the Northern Region had census data compiled in 1921, 1931 and 1952 with the following results: 10,259,983, 11,434,924 and 16,835,582 respectively. The Eastern Region, excepting Cameroon had its census data conducted in 1911 with the result given as 4,408,000. In 1921, a census was conducted for the Southern group of provinces by Mr. P. Amaury Talbot but this census was considered more of ethnological survey than a census with reported figure of 5,440,000 for Eastern provinces. Then in 1931, there was no census in the Eastern Region due to the Aba Women Riots of 1929. It was in 1952/53 that a proper census was conducted with a tinge of political interference in the three regions with the results as follows: Northern Region had 16,835,582, Western Region had 6,352,472 while the Eastern Region had 7,992,651 while Nigeria’s population was 30.4 million. It was on the basis of this 1952/53 census that the electoral infrastructure that ushered in Nigeria’s constitutional developments culminating in the 1960 Independence was based. Instead of working on the census data to delineate electoral constituencies, British colonial officials merely by fiat allocated 50% electoral representation to the Northern Region. This electoral infrastructure guaranteed Northern political ascendancy and a tenuous hold on the reigns of power over Nigeria. But it desired a firmer grip which it continued with the census of 1963/64 which gave the North 29.7 million, West 13.5 million and East 12.5 million – cumulatively giving Nigeria 55.6 million population. Military rule afforded the North dominant political control with unchallenged authority to structure Nigeria according to its political quests and desires. Apart from the rejected 1973 census no other census was held until 1991 when General Babangida conducted one which gave the North 47.2 million, West 17.6 million and the East 23.7 million. The last census was conducted in 2006 by President Obasanjo. The result gave the old North 72.8 million, old West 27.3 million while old East got 39.9 million which added together, Nigeria’s population was 140 million. Since then Nigeria’s demographic data are guesswork. Thus, on July 9, 2019, the Acting National Chairman of National Population Commission, Yusuf Anka while speaking at the World Population Day at Abuja claimed that Nigeria’s population is about 198 million but he recalled that the UNFPA had estimated it at 201 million. But the question of falsity of the census data has continually dogged the census infrastructure in Nigeria. Former Chairman of National Population Commission, Eze Festus Odimegwu had dismissed Nigeria’s census infrastructure as a fraud and promised to extirpate the fraud in proposed 2016 census. He was not allowed as Northern political establishment assailed him with all its might. In fact, after a meeting of Northern political leaders in Kaduna, Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso was detailed to go to President Jonathan to demand Odimegwu’s head on a platter. And they got it as Eze Odimegwu was queried immediately after and eventually sacked. But is there any truth in the allegation of fraud by Odimegwu against Nigeria’s census data? A commonsensical analysis of Nigeria’s census data establishes it as a fraud and highly tainted with falsity which cannot stand the test of modern demographical analysis. In establishing the charge of fraud, and thus falsity of Nigeria’s population as conveyed by Festus Odimegwu, we can take two most recent census data to prove it. In 1991 census, Lagos had a population of over five million while Kano State with Jigawa State before its creation in 1996 was about four million plus. Then in the 2006 census as conveyed by the Gazette No. 2 of February 2, 2009, Vol. 96 gave Kano State 9,401,288 while Jigawa has 4,363,002 and when added together gives old Kano State 13,769,288. Then juxtapose this figure with Lagos State’s 9,113,605. How do you explain these magical demographics? It is either there was a plague that wiped out substantial population of Lagos while Kano State experienced exponential development that tripled its population between 1991 and 2006. This fraud in the preparation of Nigeria census is an innocuous one. A very simple arithmetical formula but it is a fraud and a scam. It is found in what is called Enumeration Area Demarcation (EAD). It is this fraudulent device that census officials working for vested interests deploy to rig the census infrastructure for or against the states. Enumerated Area Demarcation is a mapped geographic unit for the purpose of counting people and households. Each EAD is allotted between 350 and 500 people. So, once EADs are given, a minimum of 350 people allotted even assuming no counting took place there. So, officials of NPC use this devious device against disaffected states and regions. In the 2006 census, Ebonyi State was able to detect this vile practice when it set up a 2006 Census Review Committee. The committee found that 13,888 EADs were mapped out in Ebonyi State but the NPC headquarters by fiat substituted this figure with 5,267 EADs. But the NPC did not touch Kano State’s EADs. The same treatment against Ebonyi State by way of drastic reduction of EADs was also applied to Lagos State. So, we can see that EAD is the pivot of all enumeration exercise. If an area is not properly demarcated the implication is that regardless of the area’s population you will be given between 350 and 500 per EAD. Census data in saner climes are political and socioeconomic instrument upon which national planning are hoisted. But in Nigeria, it is a political artifice. Those agitating for restructuring of Nigeria have greater job in changing this devious and fraudulent census data upon which the political dominance by the North is hoisted. This is even moreso given the new electoral framework erected by Prof. Atahiru Jega which now confers on the Far Northern States the unquestionable political domination of Nigeria. Without abolishing this census data upon which the voters register is based, any other section of Nigeria can only rule Nigeria at the pleasure of the Far Northern States. So, let’s join the former NPC chairman, Odimegwu, to call for a change of this fraudulent census which is a scam against all the other sections of Nigeria except the Far North.
