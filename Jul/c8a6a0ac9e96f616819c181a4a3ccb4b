 Super Eagles might be without the services of their captain Mikel Obi who is nursing a hamstring injury. The former Chelsea midfielder was substituted in the second half of their 2-0 loss to Madagascar on Sunday and our correspondent learnt the skipper suffered knocks in that encounter. When our correspondent visited the Helman Palestine Hotels of the team, Mikel was seen limping. The way he carried his body suggested the injury was serious. Eagles spokesperson Toyin Ibitoye confirmed the former Tianjin Teda star was suffering from knocks and was doubtful for the round of 16 games. “He got injured on Sunday in the game against Madagascar; we initially thought it was not serious and he should be able to recover on time but it seems it’s not improving as after as we want,” he said.
