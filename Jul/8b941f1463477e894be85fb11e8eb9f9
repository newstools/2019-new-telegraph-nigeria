Five persons were killed, while 14 others sustained injuries as a granite-laden Iveco truck rammed into a commercial bus along the Abeokuta-Ibadan road in Ogun State. The fatal crash occurred on Friday at 9:20pm at the Odeda area of the highway. The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE) confirmed the incident in separate statements yesterday. Sunday Telegraph gathered the truck, marked LAR 114 YD, while trying to avoid a pothole at Abule-Ika stretch of the road, lost control on top speed and crushed the Ibadan-bound Mazda bus with registration number MUS 367 XV. The FRSC Sector Commander, Clement Oladele, attributed the crash to dangerous driving. According to him, the victims involved in the accident included 14 male and five female. Oladele said: “The suspected cause of fatal crash was dangerous driving. The truck crushed the passengers inside the commuter bus and they were trapped. “The injured victims were rescued to Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Abeokuta, while the bodies of the victims were deposited at the morgue of State Hospital Ijaiye, Abeokuta. The obstruction was thereafter cleared off the road to prevent further crashes.” The sector commander cautioned drivers to resist driving dangerously to prevent unnecessary road crashes. On his part, the TRACE Public Relations Officer, Babatunde Akinbiyi, disclosed that “the driver of the truck and his motorboy escaped from the scene of the incident.”
