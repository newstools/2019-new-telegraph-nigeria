E do State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has assured FIFA that the state is ready to host the FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup billed for next year as Nigeria bids for the rights.   Nigeria is being considered as a potential host of the tournament and the Edo State Governor, while receiving a FIFA delegation led by FIFA Consultant, Mainasara Illo, said, “We are delighted at the endorsements of our facilities by the visiting FIFA delegation.   “Edo State is the heartbeat of Nigeria; we made our mark in sports several decades ago and we are setting the stage to bring back those glorious years of leading in all sporting activities, with our huge investment in the sector.”   “Edo is clearly the safest state in the South-south region, our people are very cosmopolitan with a rich and colourful culture.   “We have a functional airport, some of the best hotels in the country, reliable transport infrastructure that has Taxify and Uber leading the pack. So we have everything that will give our guests a memorable experience.”   The governor noted that the remodeling work on Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium will soon be completed while work on other sporting facilities is progressing.
