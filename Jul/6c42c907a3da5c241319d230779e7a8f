Parents of a five-year-old girl, Peace, who was abducted some weeks ago by a church member, Ahmed, yesterday, disclosed that the girl has been released. The victim’s mother, Mrs. Williams Koroye, said that Peace was found in Kaduna State. She said Peace was picked up by her father at a hotel room in Kaduna, where she was left by the kidnapper. The kidnapper had earlier told them to pick the baby there on Friday July 19, after collecting ransom of N1 million. Peace was abducted in their residence at Akemfa 1 Area of Yenagoa on July 10, by Ahmed. “Ahmed checked into the hotel with Peace and later told the hotel staff that he was going to bring something. He never returned until her father got to the hotel to pick her as instructed by Ahmed. Our baby is finally with us. My husband traced Ahmed to Kaduna following directions and instructions. When my husband got to the hotel, the baby was already in the hands of the hotel staff. The receptionist said that Peace was found by the cleaner, alone in the room. When my husband got there, the hotel invited the police, who in turn interrogated and scrutinised my husband’s identity. He returned with Peace. We thank God for her safe return and we have scheduled a Thanksgiving Service for August 3, 2019,” Koroye said.
