Nigerian Air Force (NAF) yesterday said many structures occupied by suspected Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP)’s fighters on the fringes of Lake Chad had been destroyed. According to the NAF, two Alpha jets were dispatched for the operation, after a conclusive Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR). The Director of Public Relations and Information (DOPRI), Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, who made the disclosure in a statement, said many of the suspected terrorists were killed during the bombardment. He said: “The Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation Lafiya Dole has destroyed additional terrorists’ structures and killed some Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters at Bakassi on the fringes of Lake Chad in Borno State in an air strike conducted yesterday, 6 July 2019. “The attack was executed as a follow-up to air raids conducted at the same location on 28 June 2019, after intelligence reports indicated the ISWAP elements, having suffered heavy casualties during the attack, had relocated surviving fighters and logistics supplies to another part of the settlement, as confirmed by Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. “The ATF therefore dispatched two Alpha jets to attack the location, with accurate hits on the identified structures, which were seen engulfed in flames. “Several terrorists were also neutralised as a result of the strike. The attached short video clip, now declassified, shows parts of the attack. “The Nigerian Air Force (NAF), operating in concert with surface forces, will sustain the effort to completely degrade the terrorists in the North-East.”
