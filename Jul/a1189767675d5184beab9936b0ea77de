The Force Headquarters has confirmed an invitation to gospel singer, Timi Dakolo, and wife, Bisola, for possible interrogation. Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO), DCP Frank Mba, while confirming the invitation, said it was consequent upon an ongoing investigation. It will be recalled that Bisola had, in an interview sometime last month, accused the senior pastor of the Commowealth Of Zion Assembly (COZA), Biodun Fatoyinbo, of rape. The allegation had attracted protests in Abuja and Lagos, leading to the stepping aside of the embattled pastor. Mba said: “The Nigeria Police Force is confirming that its operatives today (Saturday) 20th July, 2019 served official Invitation Letters on Bisola and Timi Dakolo. “The invitation is sequel to an on-going police investigation touching on the wider and highly publicized case involving Bisola Dakolo, Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo and others.” According to him, a letter of invitation was different from warrant of arrest, adding that the move was aimed at obtaining information from the couple.
