She tells VANESSA OKWARA how it all started and the kind of man she’ll like to settle down with  What was growing up like?  I grew up in a family of 13 children. We are a big extended family; I’m the last child of my parents and the only girl of my mum as well. Growing up, I had a lot of people to look up to. I had my brothers and sisters who were doing well in their work, families and different phases of life. I had a lot of role models basically and it was really exciting.   Would you say you were born with a silver spoon?  Yeah, I was born with a silver spoon. I lost my dad when I was very young. I was born in Ibadan, Oyo State, were I did my primary and secondary school. I moved to London, were I did my college and university education before moving back to Nigeria.  Why did you decide to move back to Nigeria?  I actually came for NYSC. During the course of being here, I noticed that there were lots of opportunities. Things worked out for good and bad as well.  When did you realise you had love for fashion?  Fashion has always been my thing. I moved to the UK when was 17 years old, so I had to pick up a job and I all the jobs I had done while on the UK had to do with the fashion industry. I’ve worked with

Anytime I visit Nigeria, I’ll come with like three boxes of clothes and I wouldn’t leave with any as I will give it out.  So I now thought out the business side of it, rather than just giving out clothes, I’ll also bring boxes of clothes to sell next time I visit Nigeria and when I did that, I sold out all the clothes I brought. That’s how I started initially by retailing other people’s brand before I started my own brand, 2207.  When did you start your own fashion label?   I can remember vividly because it keeps coming in my head: I was going round a mall and said to my friend then that this is my dream to have something like this where people could come and buy their everyday clothes and we just laughed about it because I was very young then. It was something I said without putting so much emphasis on it. I think God heard and answered me. So when I had my child in London, I was home for a very long period of time and when I came back to Nigeria, I was already tired of staying in London after being there for 10 years, so I decided to stay back.  So when I came back to Nigeria with no job and being a single mother, I had to think of what to do. My mother was into fashion designing although not regularly.  Mind you, my Dad of blessed memory was also a fashion designer as well and was quite successful. He was the one making NYSC clothes during his time as a big government contractor. So I can say fashion runs in the family.  So I decided to buy off the sewing machines from my mum, got one tailor and there was already a store I could use and then I got five yards of fabrics. That’s why I tell people you don’t need a big capital to start and I made a Kimono from that fabric. I had 1000 followers on Instagram, so I posted the picture and people started to like it and make orders. The five yards went that same day because I had to use it to make for two people. So I went back to the market to buy more fabrics as the order kept coming in. After that, I made a jumpsuit and a lot of people wanted it too and boom! That’s how I started. So in a few days, I sold one design in 12 pieces and that gave me the boost I needed to continue.  How long is your business?  It’s going to be three years in November.   What inspires your designs?  I love colours. If you are conversant with 2207by TBally, you will realise that I love colours a lot. What inspires me mostly is seeing women in different body types and thinking how I can create something that will suit her better. So every woman inspires me from the market woman to the nurse, corporate ladies; they all inspire my creativity. I’m a lover of fabrics as well. I’ve a lot of fabrics I’ve not even touched. When I see a fabric, I immediately know what I want to do with it; when I see fabric, I see design.  Do you do the actual sewing and designing as well?  I’m the creative director behind the brand. I bring out the design, sketch and have my tailors bring them to life and I have to watch them closely to bring it out exactly how I imagined it.  What’s the biggest challenge you had while starting your business?  That will be tailors!  They’re never consistent people. At the beginning of this year I sacked all my staff. So for two weeks, I and my supervisor were alone. It was a tough decision; I had a lot of orders I had to deliver but to God be the glory, I have what I can call my family now. The tailors I’ve now are fantastic.  They work effortlessly. I’ve been able to build them in the last six months to what I want and we are good now. Now I’ll say no more tailor problems but power.  The amount of money we spend on diesel is frustrating. Another major challenge is copying of designs. If I bring out my style on a Monday, by Wednesday, it’s everywhere!  There’s no copyright law on this country. When I started, I use to call out those copying my style and I will even get abused in the process. So copyright and power is the major problem we have in this business.  So how does it feel to be one of Nigerians celebrity designers?  I’m grateful to God and appreciate it but like I said earlier, I’m not seeing it yet. The exposure is there and people have gotten to know about the brand. I want to take this brand internationally and globally so I’ve not seen anything I’ve achieved in terms of this business. I’m just happy I’m doing something and people are accepting it. My yearly earning is still not up to Amazon but I’m glad that when you talk about Nigerian brands, you can talk about 2207 by TBally. People should expect more because we shall do better.  Which of the celebrities did you design for that actually brought you to limelight and made other celebrities to take note?  When I started 2207, I had a family friend, popular actress, Toyin Abraham.  We discussed collaboration in this business. So when AMVCA came in 2017, we created a dress for Toyin, a nude ball gown for her and she looked totally different from the regular Toyin and she really loved her dress.  Immediately we posted the picture, my phone was on fire! I could remember because it was a memorable day for us. Toyin’s look was totally different that day and every blog carried her as one of the best dressed that year. It was indeed phenomenal!  That was the start of the awareness for my brand.  Can you mention some other celebrities you’ve worked with since then?  Oh, quite a lot! I’ve my ladies like Ini Edo, she always praises my designs on her page; she helped bring the brand out too after Toyin. Also Linda Osifo wears my brand a lot too.  Others  are: Lilian Afegbai  Bolanle Olukanni, Omotala Jalade Ekehinde, Mimi Onalaja, Uche Jumbo, Toke Makinwa , Ini Dima Okojie, Beverly Naya, my girl from Ghana, Nana;  Cee-c too. It’s best I don’t keep mentioning so I don’t make others feel bad.  Do you have role models you look up to?  Yes I do, her name is Conna Walker and she’s the House of CB Founder. Her story is just like mine. She started out being a retailer; she’s a London girl from Essex. Today, Conna Walker is on Forbes now. She clothes top international celebrities like Beyonce, Kylie Kendall. When you think about High street retail store, you will think of House of CB. Her style is fantastic. She’s young but doing very well.  Describe your own fashion style.  I’m very confident when it comes to my style. I could wear and pull anything.  I love colours. I don’t shy away from loose or tight clothes. My style also depends on my mood. For my every day, you’ll see me with jeans and T-Shirts mostly; I’m a very comfortable dresser when it comes to normal days. I can show any part of my body. How do you keep your body in good shape?  I just eat well and exercise. I’m a diet freak, I watch what I out in my tummy. Why is the name of your brand ‘2207’ in particular?  It’s my son’s date of birth, 22nd of July.  How do you handle being a single parent?  It’s demanding you’re the father, mother and decision maker. You learn along the line. It becomes easier when you have a good family support system. My family is very supportive. I’m a fantastic mother to my son and that’s my greatest achievement in this world.  When it comes to relationships, are you a romantic person? Yes, I am. What are the qualities you look out for in a man for marriage?  I’m the kind of person that blanks my mind when it comes to these things but I know that the person I’m going to get married to loves me and I love him right back. I will marry my friend basically. Where do you see yourself in the next five years?  That I’ve achieved the things I wanted to achieve and for my brand 2207, we would’ve had the international exposure we are looking for. How do you relax?  My relaxation has to do with food. I love food so much, go to a good lounge or restaurant and have a good meal.  Best vacation spot? I will like to go to Santorini in Greece; I’ve never been there before. For me it’s really more about the company. I could go to Ondo State and really gave a good time. I went to Kenya once and that has been my best holiday so far.
