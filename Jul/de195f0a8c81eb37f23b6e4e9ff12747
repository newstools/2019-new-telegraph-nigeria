 An Igando Customary Court yesterday granted the request of Pastor Abayomi Adegboyega to dissolve the 16-year-old marriage to his wife, Mrs. Risikat Adegboyega (39), over issues of bribe before sex. Abayomi had sued his wife before the customary court over her incessant demand of bribe before sex. President of the court, Mr. Adeniyi Koledoye, held that since the petitioner insisted on divorce after several interventions, the court was left with no option than to grant him his wish and pronounced the union dissolved. He said: “I hereby pronounce the marriage between Pastor Abayomi Adegboyega and Mrs. Risikat Adegboyega dissolved today, both of you henceforth cease to be husband and wife. “Each of you should go on his or her separate ways unmolested; the court wishes both of you well in your future endeavour. “The custody of the first and third children of the marriage are awarded to the petitioner while the second and fourth children are awarded to the respondent, their mother. “The petitioner must be paying N10,000 monthly for the feeding of the two children in his wife’s custody and must also be responsible for their education and general welfare. “The petitioner is to pay a severance of N200,000 to his wife in order for her to move on with her life.” The 48-year-old Abayomi has approached the court seeking to end his marriage on the grounds that his wife denied him sex. He alleged that Risikat, a mother of four, always demands `bribe’ from him before sex. “My wife starves me of sex. She will never allow me to sleep with her unless I give her money or buy her a gift,” he said. Abayomi said that he would kill himself if the court refused to dissolve the union which produced four children. He said: “Risikat should never come near me. I do not want to have anything to do with her again. “She is irritating me. I will kill myself if the loveless marriage is not dissolved.”
