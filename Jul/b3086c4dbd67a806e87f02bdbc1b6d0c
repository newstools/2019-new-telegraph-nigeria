 Bishops of the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion) have cautioned the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration on unpopular decisions and policies that are not in favour of the majority, warning that embarking on such may set the nation ablaze.
Speaking yesterday at the Consecration of four Suffragan Bishops and presentation of two archbishops at Archbishop Vining Memorial Church Cathedral (AVMCC), Ikeja, Lagos, the Primate of Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), The Most Revd Nicholas Okoh; Archbishop of Enugu Province, Most Revd Emmanuel Chukwuma and Bishop of Lagos West Diocese, Rt. Revd Olusola Odedeji, urged Nigerian leaders to thread with caution.
Primate Okoh, who spoke on the state of the nation, said government must do something to gain the confidence of the people. “Some of the things are very provocative and government should do something to gain the confidence of the people. It is not good to take people for granted,” he said.
Most Revd Chukwuma, on his part, advised the Federal Government to put necessary policies in place to make life comfortable for Nigerians.
Also speaking, Bishop Odedeji urged government not to carry out any unpopular policy that might set the nation ablaze.
“This time, we should be more prayerful. If there is anything this country needs now, it is prayer, especially at this time when some unpopular decisions are being made.”
