Pour the garden egg puree into a clean pot and cook till all or almost all the water dries up. Set it aside.  Pour the palm oil into a clean dry pot and heat it up. Do not bleach it; you only need to heat till a piece of onion sizzles when added to the hot oil.  When the oil is hot enough, add the onions and fry for about 2 minutes. Add the garden egg puree and stir for a bit. Cover the pot and cook-fry for some time and stir again.  Repeat till the small amount of water in the puree dried up.
