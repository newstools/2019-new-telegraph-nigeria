An expert in the media buying and planning sub sector and CEO of Media Perspectives, Jude Odia, has advised members of Outdoor Advertising Association of Nigeria (OAAN) to embrace digital advertising to remain relevant.  Odia made this known at the just concluded 34th annual conference of OAAN held in Abeokuta, with the theme: “Future of OOH in Nigeria: Debt, Ethics and Best Practices”, said the media landscape has changed in the last few years.  “In the last 10 years, the  Nigerian advertising industry has witnessed disruptions with digital advertising continually occupying bigger space. Global predictions indicate that digital advertising is on the increase and in Nigeria, it has 8 percent share of total Ad spend from about 5 percent three years ago.  “In recent times, the media landscape and the game has changed as advertisers that used to see, for instance, mobile advertising as a complementary consideration are now considering it first in their budget because of impact, emotive connection and reach,” he said.
