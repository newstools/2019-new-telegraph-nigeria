A Jikwoyi Customary Court, on Tuesday, gave a businessman, Chijioke Chukwu, a second opportunity to defend himself in a divorce petition filed against him by his wife, Cynthia. The presiding judge, Justice Everyman Eleanya, fixed August 1, for Chukwu to open his defence, after he failed to appear in court. Chukwu’s Counsel, Mr Sonny Tado, had earlier apologised to the court over his client’s inability to appear. Justice Eleanya, accepted his apologies and adjourned the case for defence. In his apology, Tado said: “My client could not get a flight coming to Abuja, he said if he knew it would be so, he would have joined the morning bus, and would have gotten into Abuja yesterday”, he explained. He begged the court to adjourn the suit to a near, saying, “he is already on his way, he would be around tomorrow”. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Cynthia, the petitioner, dragged her husband Chukwu to seeking divorce, on grounds that her husband was an unrepentant womaniser. “I have seen packets of condom in his bag on many occasions, when I confronted him, he made it clear to me that he was having affairs and that I should learn to live with it.
