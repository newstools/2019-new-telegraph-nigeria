 Super Eagles Manager, Gernot Rohr, has said his wards are ready to defeat the defending champions Cameroon when the two sides clash in the round of 16 tie on Saturday (tomorrow), insisting they are not ready to leave Egypt yet.
Rohr noted that the Eagles had shrugged off their 2-0 defeat to Madagascar and the circumstance of the loss bodes well for the team ahead of their clash with the Indomitable Lions.
The German tactician recalled that the Super Eagles spanked the Lions 4-0 in a 2019 FIFA World Cup qualifying match 2017, few weeks after they suffered an embarrassing 2-0 defeat in the hands of South Africa in an AFCON qualifier in Uyo.
He said history had a way of repeating itself in football and the loss in their last group game could galvanize them to a better performance.
He admitted the match would be a difficult one for the two sides as they both have rich history in the competition.
“This is a very difficult game for us; the Cameroonians have a very good team, they qualified for the second round with five points and we have six, my players are ready, we are preparing very hard for this important match.
“We have an advantage of having a day more to rest, we had six days, they have five. We want to find a way of progressing in the competition; we want to stay here in Egypt, we don’t want to leave yet. The matches are going to be tough as from now on and we feel there won’t be any room for errors again,” he said.
