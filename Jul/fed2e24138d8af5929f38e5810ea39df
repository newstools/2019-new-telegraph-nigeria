From Musa Pam, Jos Three persons have been confirmed killed by suspected Fulani herdsmen following fresh attacks on Sunday night and Monday Morning in Tafigana and Ancha villages of Bassa Local Government Area of Plateau State. President Irigwe Youth Movement, Bassa LGC, Mr Chinge Dodo Ayuba, who confirmed the killing of the three persons to New Telegraph on Monday, described as sad the incessant attacks on innocent villagers. “Yesterday July 14, 2019 Fulani herdsmen attacked Tafigana village in Miango District of Irigwe Chiefdom in the evening and killed Mr Sunday Wolo and his son, Ngwe Sunday, the assault continued this morning with another village, Ancha attacked and a woman killed. As I’m talking to you now more attacks are on-going. “As a people we are continuously under attack and nobody seems to be hearing our cries for help while killing of our people has now become a routine.” However, efforts by New Telegraph to contact the Plateau State Police Command’s Public Relation Officer, DSP Mathias Tyopev to confirm the report failed as phone calls to his number proved abortive as at the time of filing this report.
