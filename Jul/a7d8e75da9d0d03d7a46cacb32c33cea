Kenya’s Finance Minister Henry Rotich and more than two dozen other officials are expected to be arrested after the director of public prosecutions alleged they were involved in corruption. Noordin Haji said they would be charged with “conspiracy to defraud, failure to comply with guidelines relating to procurement” among other things. The charges relate with plans to build two dams in the country at a large expense, reports the BBC. Haji said “this kind of crime… enslaves us with unnecessary debt and mortgagees our future generations”. He added: “The persons we are charging today… deliberately breached [the public’s] trust… they ensured the funds did not come into the consolidated fund – guaranteeing no-one had oversight over its use. “Colossal amounts were unjustifiably and illegally paid out through a well-choreographed scheme by government officers in collusion with private individuals and institutions.”
