A former Group General Manager, Crude Oil Marketing Division of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and a ministerial nominee, Mr. Goddy Jeddy-Agba, yesterday, said he will end subsidy regime in Nigeria, if appointed as Minister of State for Petroleum. Stating this at the Senate confirmation hearing for ministerial nominees, Jeddy-Agba advocated the establishment of a control room equipped with competent professionals and modern technology to end oil theft and pipeline vandalism. He said he would push for the optimum functionality of all government owned refineries and the completion of privately owned refineries under construction as we well as the establishment of modular refineries if appointed as a minister. He pointed out that the Nigerian government does not need to pay trillions of tax payers’ money to subsidise imported refined petroleum products once crude could be taken directly to the existing functional refineries across the country. His words: “We don’t need to import petroleum products. What we need to do is to strengthen the various agencies to checkmate the actual crude being loaded and write report. “We do not have the technology to monitor the process of loading up to the point of export. For now, it is the International Oil Companies that determine the quantity of crude they export because we don’t have control over their operations. “If I am in that ministry, I will push for the establishment of a control room from where we will monitor the process of crude loading up to the point of export.” Suggesting how to end pipeline vandalism, he said that the most effective and efficient approach is to lay the type of pipes that would be difficult to destroy while drones should be deployed to monitor them and spraying of hot water on the vandals.
