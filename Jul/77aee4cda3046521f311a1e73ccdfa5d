The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its governors have commended the Supreme Court justices for refusing to succumb to the pressure by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to reverse its judgment, voiding the participation of the APC and its candidates in Zamfara State in the last general elections.
PDP, in a statement Monday by it’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the apex court has once again saved the nation from constitutional crisis.
The party described the APC’s application to the Supreme Court as “blasphemous, a blackmail as well as a measured landmine set by APC leaders in their desperation to ambush and destroy the integrity of the apex court.”
It added that the motive was to foist a totalitarian order on the polity.
“It is also instructive to note that by asking the Supreme Court to embark on a journey to nowhere, the APC clearly sought to subvert our democratic system and surreptitiously force on Nigerians, a system that is completely alien to our constitutional democracy and outside the confines and dictates of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).
“APC’s demand is a direct threat to our democracy, peace and stability of our nation and shows its unwillingness, as a party, to abide by the rule of law.
“It also exposes APC’s penchant for sowing crisis in our nation; a situation that should be condemned by all,” PDP stated.
Also the PDP Governors’ Forum said the judgement has stopped the sinister plan of the APC against people of Zamfara State.
