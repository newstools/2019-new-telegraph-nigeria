As part of efforts to improve service delivery across airports in the country, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) said it was determined to improve service delivery to ensure passengers have value for their money. This is just as the agency said it had established a management taskforce on service delivery . The Managing Director FAAN, Capt Rabiu Yadudu, who disclosed this during an interactive forum at the international wing of the Murtala Muhammed Airport (MMA), Lagos, explained that the tasks force was putÂ  together in 2018 and that it was borne out of the negative experiences observed at Enugu International Airport, where service delivery was at a very low ebb. Yadudu, who spoke through the General Manager, Customers Service /SERVICOM, Mrs Ebele Okoye, said that the department was actually out to create awareness and sensitisation but that the task force found out that Enugu Airport was operated more as a domestic airport. Yadudu stated that it was also discovered that interaction of agencies with passengers on service delivery were unhealthy and was not an acceptable global practice and that management was consulted and approval was granted. He added that at Enugu Airport passengers were subjected to sever and unhealthy scrutiny and also kept on queue after arrival for hours in the pretence of searching for hard drugs.
