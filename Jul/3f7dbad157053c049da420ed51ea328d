One of the major sponsors of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Zenith bank, has charged the Super Eagles to go all out for a win today against Algeria in the semi-final game of the on-going Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. Super Eagles of Nigeria defeated South Africa 2-1 in the quarter-final while Algeria overcame Cote d’Ivoire on penalties to get to the final four.  While congratulating the team, the bank said they must complete the job with a win on Sunday against the Desert Foxes.  The Group Managing Director of the bank, Ebenezer Onyeagwu, commended the fighting spirit of the Eagles adding that they have displayed the quality of champions. Onyeagwu, however, urged them not to rest on their oars as he charged them to go all out for a win against Algeria and qualify for the final.  “They should continue with the spirit of a champion and go all out against Algeria,” he said.  “Nigerians are happy with them and I want to appeal to them to continue the good work and try to get to the final. “We won the last time we participated in the competition and now it’s just two games for the Eagles to win the trophy, so they should give it their all. “Zenith Bank will continue to support them as all Nigerians are doing at the moment and we can’t wait for them to come back with the trophy.”
