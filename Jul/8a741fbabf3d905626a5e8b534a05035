The Vice-Chancellor, University of Ilorin, Prof. Sulyman Abdulkareem, has called on agricultural engineers to proffer modern techniques and innovations to improve the preservation of yam in the country. The vice-chancellor made the call while receiving representatives of the Nigerian Institute of Agricultural Engineers (NIAE). Prof. Abdulkareem said the unavailability of modern innovation was the reason good quality yam is barely available after its harvest season. He indicated that these new techniques would make yam wastage a thing of the past and improve farmers yield. “Agricultural engineers should make life easier for the farmers. It is a shame that farmers still have to climb the palm tree in this age to tap wine in spite of the technology available to us. “You should ensure that farming is technologically-driven by coming up with indigenous solutions that will be cheap; yet serves the same purpose as the foreign technology,’’ Abdulkareem said. The vice-chancellor also advised NIAE to utilise the technology that could be sourced locally as this will contribute to the wealth of farmers.
