The National/State Assembly election petition tribunal sitting in Makurdi has fixed July 15 for ruling on Chief Steven Lawani’s application for additional witness statement on oath.  Announcing the date for the ruling, chairman of the tribunal, Justice A A Adeleye, said the ruling would make the tribunal and all  the parties in the Steven Lawani/ Abba Moro senatorial election case to properly situate the hearing. Adeleye said after due consultation with counsels to the petitioners and the respondents, the tribunal has consequently fixed July 15 as new date for hearing.  He said counsel to the petitioner, Mr. Sunday Okpale, would open his case on July15 and continues for some days while the respondents would present their case thereafter and conclude on July 30. It would be recalled that the tribunal and the appeal Court had struck out Lawani’s application for inclusion of additional witnesses in the petition but his lawyers have applied to the tribunal for the inclusion of additional witness statement.  It is the application that informed the adjustment of the period for hearing on the case which was earlier fixed for June 17 but was shifted foward because of several applications presented by counsels.
