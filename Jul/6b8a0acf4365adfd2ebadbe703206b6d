Gunmen yesterday invaded Odoni community in Sagbama Local Government Area of Bayelsa State and abducted the mother of former Super Eagles player and coach, Samson Siasia. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr. Asinim Butswat, who confirmed the incident, said the heavily armed men came through the waterways of the River Nun about 2a.m. Butswat said the gunmen invaded the residence of the 80-year-old Mrs. Ogere Beauty Siasia, in the coastal community of Odoni and whisked her away. He said the commissioner of police and the commandâ€™s Tactical Team had visited the scene of the crime. According to the PPRO, the police, in collaboration with other security stakeholders, have launched a manhunt to apprehend the kidnappers and rescue the victim. Family sources said the kidnappers gained entry to the house of the mother of the former Super Eagles coach by breaking the back door of the building. The family members said the victim did not take her blood pressure drugs, adding that they were yet to be contacted. According to them, the matriarch of the Siasia family cannot remember any phone number of her relatives off hand. This is the second time she was abducted by gunmen. Madam Siasia was earlier abducted in November 2015. Then, she spent 13 days with her abductors. During that period, Samson Siasia was in Gambia preparing the Olympic Eagles for the Under-23 Africa qualifier for 2016 Rio Olympic at the time when her mother was whisked away by the kidnappers.
