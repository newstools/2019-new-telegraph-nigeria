A 52-year-old, Breedlov Shawn, was yesterday arrested at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos on arrival into the country. Shawn, it was learnt, came to Nigeria to visit his Yoruba fiancée. The DPO in charge of MMIA, SP Danjuma Garuba Ridah, who confirmed the arrest, told journalists that the foreigner fought and stabbed an operator of the towing van working at the airport. Ridah said the Uber vehicle, which had come to pick Shawn, packed wrongly and an attempt was made to tow the vehicle but the foreigner refused, and stabbed the driver of the towing vehicle with the Uber’s car key. He said: “He is in detention and by God’s grace we are charging him to court. He is a U.S. citizen. Actually, what happened was that he came to Nigeria to see his fiancée, Adefunke Adegbola. So when he came to Nigeria, the fiancée now took Uber to the airport. The woman went and parked at a wrong place. When towing van came to tow the vehicle from that place, the lady was inside because they had already received the foreigner inside the Uber. “The man came out and started dragging with the towing van people. He said they should not tow the vehicle. Then, they told him that it was wrong parking at a wrong place.” The police said the injured driver was taken to the Air Force Hospital and he had been operated upon.
