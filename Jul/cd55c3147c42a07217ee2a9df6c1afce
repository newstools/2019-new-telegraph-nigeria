EasyLife Initiative for Rural Youths (ELIRY) has called on Abia State government to allow pupils in public schools in the state learn under a conducive environment since it was their fundamental rights.
The group through its National Secretary, Comrade Emeku Uche Udensi made the call in Aba on yesterday.
Udensi said politicians had no right to deprive children of quality educational training while they send their children abroad to study.
He said: “I believe it is gross injustice for political leaders not to put basic infrastructure in schools for the younger ones knowing that the biggest industry in Abia is education.
“They would not put the schools in order for the children of the poor to learn and yet their children go abroad to study and they pay there in hard currency.”
“They refuse to look at the schools or improve their infrastructure yet every month they receive federal allocations and claim to have education ministry budgets. That is very bad and unacceptable.
“A few public primary schools in Abia state are in a sorry state although the state government had returned some schools to Church owners, the ones government retained are nothing to write home about.
“For instance, if you go to Model II Primary School at World Bank Housing Estate, Aba, you will find out that the school compound is always waterlogged after rains.
“Most of the spaces used for agricultural studies in the primary schools when we were growing up have all been turned to an extension of Eziukwu Market (the Cemetery Market).
“I believe that Abia House of Assembly Speaker who is a vibrant young man will add these things to their oversight functions and make the necessary changes Abians are hoping for.
“And that he would ensure that those involved in selling school lands in Aba and Abia in general are made to pay for them without being covered for who they are.”
