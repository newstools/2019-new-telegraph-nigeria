The Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) yesterday said that the increasing rate of kidnapping, banditry and armed robbery witnessed in many parts of the country was due to bad roads resulting from substandard road projects.  SSANU National President, Samson Ugwoke, who made this known at the 36th National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the union in Makurdi, Benue State, lamented that Nigerian roads had become death traps, claiming many lives on a daily basis.  According to him, there was the need for the Federal Government to take stringent measures to address the grave issue by ensuring that companies that had and were carrying out substandard road projects were blacklisted. He said: “We have transversed the country and have seen the nature of the roads, we have also seen why it is easy to kidnap people on the highway, it is because of the bad roads that we have.  “If you check where we have the military and police check points and recently the Federal Road Safety Corps check points, they are all at the bad portions of the roads. So you must slow down, when you slow down you are under arrest.  “So, we are appealing to the Federal Government that one of the ways they should address kidnapping, armed robbery and banditry is by fixing Nigeria highways. Government should fix Nigeria highways, the money is there even if it is by concession, they should do it. “Government should also not patronise companies that are doing shoddy jobs. Many of the roads are less than five years, they were constructed but they have broken down.   “We should blacklist the companies that do substandard jobs in Nigeria. We have good companies with good records.”
