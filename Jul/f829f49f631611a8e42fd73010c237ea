Chairman of Pacific Comprehensive College, Lagos, Mr. Omosowon Remigious, yesterday, tasked graduating students of the institution to remain focus and ensure their effort reflect the peculiarities of time and challenges that come with it in order to achieve a desired goal.   Omosowon, who gave the charge at the 2019 valedictory service and graduation/prize-giving ceremony of the school, cautioned the departing students to moderate their actions and inaction, as they may not be lucky to have their parent’s within earshot to sound the alarm bells at regular intervals.   The Chairman, expressed sadness that he would miss the students, some of whom he said he had established strong affection with over the last three to six years they spent in the college. He, however, harped on the need for them to make excellence their watchword as they chase the Golden Fleece.   “It is going to be an understatement if I say I am not going to miss them. Some of them have been here in the last six years, some four, some three. But the truth of the matter is that I can’t hold them down; they are moving forward in their lives,” the proprietor stated.
