Management of The Polytechnic, Ibadan, Oyo State, on Wednesday burnt thousands of cell phones worth over N15 million seized from students during examination periods. The immediate past Deputy Rector of the institution, Bayo Oyeleke (a sculptor), told journalists that the authorities took the action to make the institution’s examinations sacred. He said some students continued to violate the school regulations by going into the exam hall with their mobile phones. Burning the phones, he said, was to serve as deterrent to students of the institution who might wish to further indulge in the illegal and inappropriate act. Also present at the exercise were the Deputy Registrar, Mrs Ayoade, the Public Relations Officer (PRO), Alhaji Soladoye Adewole, Chief Security Officer, Mr. Adebayo, Head of Legal Unit of The Polytechnic, Ibadan, Mr. Ige, and President of the Students Union Government, Comrade Akadiri Bayonle, among others. The PRO, Adewole, confirmed the burning of the phones yesterday. He said: “We had to take the action to sternly serve as deterrent to other students. We cannot continue to condone indiscipline in our school. Telephones all over the world have now become a tool of undermining academic activities, especially examinations. In the past, we were punishing any erring student with fine. But we soon realised that they were brazenly paying the fines believing that they could still continue in the illegal and immoral act. “Some had been expelled in the past, while many had been suspended depending on the gravity of their examination offences. We believe that with this unprecedented step taken by the management, examination malpractices through use of mobile phones will be nipped in the bud.”
