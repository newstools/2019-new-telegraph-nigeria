K ano Pillars on Sunday buried the ghost of last year’s AITEO Cup by defeating Niger Tornadoes in the final of this year’s edition of the competition.   The Nigeria Professional Football League runners-up defeated Tornadoes 4-3 on penalties after regulation time ended goalless at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium, Kaduna.  In what was a drab game, the proximity of Kano and Minna to Kaduna was a good factor as the final saw a full capacity stadium.  Pillars finished second in the NPFL and are already guaranteed a spot in next season’s CAF Champions League.  Kano Pillars have now won the ultimate prize of N25m as winners while Tornadoes were awarded N10m.  Meanwhile, Nasarawa Amazons have won this year’s edition of the women’s Cup at the final of the competition played at Ahmadu Bello Stadium, Kaduna.  The Amazons defeated Rivers Angels 5-4 on penalties as there was no goal in the regulation time of the game.  Nasarawa state government had promised mouth-watering gifts to the Amazon players if they lift the trophy.
