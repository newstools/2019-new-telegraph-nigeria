 …says conflict in states politically motivated   Worried over the increased spate of killings and kidnappings by men alleged to be Fulani herdsmen, the Congress of Northern Nigeria Christians, has called on the Federal Government to commence a mandatory data capturing of Fulani herdsmen, seeking to graze their animals in the country. That it said was in order to differentiate between violent and non violent Fulani.  This was contained in a communiqué issued at the end of the national interethnic peace conference organised by the Congress with the theme, ‘Building the Bridge of  Peaceful Coexistence’ and made available to newsmen by its chairman, Daniel Kadzai, in Abuja over the weekend.  According to them, there was the need to urgently review the constitution in order to address the clauses which were creating the lacuna, fanning despotism and making the nation increasingly difficult to effectively govern, as well as the allegiance of law enforcement officers and agencies to the President rather than to the constitution as seen in other parts of the world.  While condemning all forms of criminal activities and what the group described as “backdoor arrangements” by the government to accommodate strangers in the country, the group lamented that the conflicts witnessed in many states were politically motivated.
