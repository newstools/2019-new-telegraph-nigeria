No fewer than four hundred and fifty-eight beneficiaries of the presidential amnesty programme are currently undergoing vocational training in various skills. The training conducted by specialised partners in Lagos, Bayelsa, Delta, Ondo, Imo and Rivers states, would last between six to nine months. The beneficiaries were being trained in tailoring and fashion design; installation and maintenance of tricycles, transformer repairs and maintenance, shoe-making, as well as fish farming. Among them were 200 beneficiaries who commenced a nine months training in transformer repairs and maintenance on July 3, 2019, in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, and were expected to graduate April next year. A breakdown of the trade areas of the 458 beneficiaries showed that 44 were training in installation and maintenance of tricycles; 62 in tailoring and fashion design, 90 in fish farming and 18 in shoe-making. This was even as 51 beneficiaries of the programme were awaiting deployment in Rivers and Delta states for training in argon welding/fabrication and fish farming. Meanwhile, 32 beneficiaries trained in tailoring and fashion design at the Balamere Fashion House in Epe, Lagos State, graduated yesterday, July 24. Some other beneficiaries, who were currently in training, were expected to graduate soon.
