Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors’ Forum yesterday advised the National Assembly to obey the court order stopping it from interfering in the affairs of Bauchi State House of Assembly. Chairman of the forum and Bayelsa State Governor Seriake Dickson, in a statement yesterday advised the lawmakers not to succumb to the culture of impunity and lawlessness. “Acting otherwise or delaying in respecting the order would represent a direct and serious affront to the rule of law in a democratic government and a dangerous abuse of power; which Nigerians would see as steadily emboldening a climate of impunity in governance, and strengthening the hands of those who unleash brutal force against democracy,” the governor said. He said: “Impunity breeds and feeds resentment and division, conflicts, radicalism and extremism and represents a revolving door for infinite cycles of violence. “Impunity will only change Nigeria for the worse.” A high court in Bauchi had on Monday issued an order restricting the National Assembly from wading into the leadership crisis in the Bauchi State House of Assembly. The order stopped a committee set up by the House of Representatives from proceeding with its assignment, pending the ruling on a motion filed before it. Two speakers, Abubakar Suleiman and Kawuwa Shehu-Damina, had emerged at the inauguration of 9th Bauchi Assembly through parallel elections; prompting a 12-member House of Representatives Committee headed by Sarkin Adar, to be constituted with the mandate to find out the circumstances surrounding the development. However, an interim injunction dated July 22, granted by Justice Muazu Abubakar, said the parties involved in the crisis should halt all proceedings until October 3, when the court would sit to hear the motion filed by the applicants.
