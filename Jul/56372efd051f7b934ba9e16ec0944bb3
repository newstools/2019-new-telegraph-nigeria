T he House of Representatives is committed to the resuscitation of the nation’s seaports, and will also work towards reviving the moribund refineries, a member of the lower chamber of the National Assembly, Dr Alex Egbona has hinted. Egbona, who was appointed Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Petroleum Resources Downstream Sector, said in an interview that it was the conviction of the House that with a deliberate commitment and political will, the nation’s seaports can return to life and made the refineries made to work at maximum capacity.  Recall that Egbona, who represents the Abi/Yakurr Federal Constituency of Cross River State, had on Wednesday been named member of the ad hoc committee of the House to investigate issues and challenges that have crippled the seaports in Calabar, Onitsha, Warri and Port Harcourt, with a view to reviving them.   The Cross River Rep, the only member of the APC to have won in the state during the last general elections, was also appointed into the ad hoc committee to investigate employments in some Federal Government ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs). The ad hoc committee has five weeks to turn in their report.   In an interview with a select group of journalists, Egbona restated his commitment to a robust representation of the Abi/Yakurr people in the Lower Chamber of the National Assembly, with particular attention to employment and empowerment opportunities.   He said his appointment as Deputy Chairman of the committee on the downstream sector in the House of Representatives was not for himself, but for the people of his constituency, whom he said would be the greatest beneficiaries.   “From day one, I have maintained the position that my election into the House of Representatives was not for myself or any member of my family. Those around me know that I take much more seriously, the interest of the common man than even my own interests,” he said.
