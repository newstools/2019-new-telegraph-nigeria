 Kaduna State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday alleged that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state and the state government were putting pressure on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to tamper with election materials used for the conduct of the governorship election.
This was as the party warned INEC not to yield to any external pressure as any attempt to tamper with the election materials may jeopardise the ‘fragile’ peace in the state.
A statement signed by Abraham Alberah Catoh, PDP state Publicity Secretary and made available to newsmen, disclosed that his party “has received credible information that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is under intense pressure to tamper with election materials used for the conduct of governorship election on 9th March, 2019 in the state.”
The statement also said: “In as much as we do not want to question the integrity of INEC, we wish to state that the eyes and ears of our teeming party faithful/sympathisers are wide open in all INEC offices spread throughout the 23 local government areas of Kaduna State and the state INEC headquarters.
“We advise INEC not to do anything that could tamper with the fragile peace reigning in the state as any attempt to do the bidding of undemocratic external forces will be resisted by the public whose mandate was earlier stolen.
“We are drawing the attention of the world, Nigerians and the people of Kaduna State in particular, to note the attempt by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the government of Kaduna State to coerce INEC into tampering with electoral materials.”
