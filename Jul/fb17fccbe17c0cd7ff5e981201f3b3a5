He might be one of the raves of the moment right now but there was a time Zlatan Ibile was a young music act who had not found fame and was desperate about getting the attention of rapper and YBNL boss, Olamide. In screenshots of DMs he shared on Thursday, Zlatan Ibile posted DMs he sent to Olamide not so long ago, specifically in 2016, before he became the act many are talking about in the industry today. Showing Zlatan Ibile begging profusely to secure a collaboration with Olamide who he saw as his only route to fame and fortune. To underscore his desperation, Zlatan Ibile went as far as saying: “If I die tomorrow and I don’t get the chance to sit and talk to you, I won’t be happy with myself.”
