…as Nadal sets up grudge match with Kyrgios  Eight-time Wimbledon champion Roger Federer overcame a first set scare to reach the second round on Tuesday beating South African debutant Lloyd Harris 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2. Federer’s great rival Rafael Nadal also went through in easier fashion beating Japanese qualifier Yuichi Sugita 6-3, 6-1, 6-3 to set up a fascinating tussle with fiery Australian Nick Kyrgios. Kyrgios, who stunned Nadal as a 144-ranked wildcard on his tournament debut in 2014, put in a typically raucous and charismatic display to claim a 7-6 (7/4), 3-6, 7-6 (12/10), 0-6, 6-1 win over countryman Jordan Thompson. “Not sure that me and Rafa could go down to the Dog and Fox and have a beer together,” said a typically frank Kyrgios on their relationship. However, Nadal refused to add fuel to the fire on Tuesday ahead of Thursday’s clash. “I am too old to get into all this stuff,” the 33-year-old said when asked for his view on facing a man who he accused earlier this year of “lacking respect”.
“I believed in what I said but I am not going to get into a fight with anyone.” Federer admitted it had taken time to get going against a far form over-awed opponent, who was hampered later on with a calf injury. However, while Federer, Nadal, progressed, another of the top 10 seeds fell by the wayside — two-time French Open finalist Dominic Thiem’s lack of ease on grass being exposed by veteran American serve and volleyer Sam Querrey. Querrey, a Wimbledon semi-finalist in 2017, prevailed 6-7 (4/7), 7-6 (7/1), 6-3, 6-0.  Seven-time champion Serena Williams joined them in the second round but put in a rather laborious performance before beating Italian qualifier Giulia Gatto-Monticone 6-2, 7-5.  However, the 37-year-old professed herself to be content with her performance as she has been struggling with a knee injury.
