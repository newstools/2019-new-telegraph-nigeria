A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Oyo State, Alhaji Adebisi Olopoeniyan Sunday admitted the allegation by officials of last administration of Senator Abiola Ajimobi, that he was the mastermind of last week’s recovery of missing government vehicles in Ibadan, saying those pointing fingers at him were shameless.  Aides of the former governor, Abiola Ajimobi, had on Friday, at a press conference, denied vehicles were missing, just as they fingered Olopoeniyan as the arrowhead of the people going about to forcefully hijack the alleged stolen vehicles from officials of the last administration.  Apparently miffed by the media reports over the development, Olopoeniyan, who disclosed that he led some people ‘to recover government vehicles from where they hid them’ by officials of the Ajimobi government, said those addressing the media over the matter were shameless. “They were in government from May 29, 2011 till May 29, 2019 and yet they were not satisfied with all the booties in their care and pecks they derived so far from holding positions of authority.  “I can’t deny that government stolen vehicles carted away by them are being recovered daily, let them keep quiet or we will be forced to expose the atrocities further.  “It is true I led people to recover the vehicles where they were hidden. We got information that if we didn’t arrive where the vehicles were packed, they could be moved away.  “We know the police may not act on it before they (vehicles) are relocated, because of official demands and other considerations, so I led people there; got their keys and I asked the drivers to take them to Government House,” he explained.
