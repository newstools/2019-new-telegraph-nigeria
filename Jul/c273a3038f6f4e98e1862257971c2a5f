A 34-year-old man, Saheed Bolarinwa, has been arrested for allegedly defiling an eight-year-old girl at Somolu area of Lagos State. Bolarinwa reportedly lured the girl to come and watch a movie in his house but took advantage of her. After abusing the girl, the suspect threatened to kill her if she told anybody about what he did to her. The victim’s mother, who just returned from Ilorin in Kwara State where she travelled to, noticed the way her daughter was walking, questioned her to know what was wrong with her. It was in the process that she discovered that the girl had been abused. The Coordinator of Advocate for Children and Vulnerable Persons Network of Nigeria, Somolu Local Government Area, Comrade Toyin Okanlawon, reported the matter to Alade Police Station before the suspect was arrested. Okanlawon said the suspect took advantage of the girl when her mother travelled to Ilorin for a function and threatened to kill her if she told anybody.  As a result of that the girl was dying in silence. The coordinator said after committing the crime, the suspect ran out of the community to evade arrest. However, Bolarinwa was later arrested when he returned to the community on Monday to pick his motorbike. “When the suspect was arrested by the policemen, the victim was called in to identify him and she was able to point at him as the person that abused her. “The victim was later taken to Women at Risk International Foundation (WARIF), where she was medically tested and confirmed to be abused by the suspect. “I want to appreciate the Alade DPO for his fatherly role in the arrest of the suspect and he had since been transferred to Gender Section of the state Police Command Headquarters for further investigation,” Okanlawon said. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Bala Elkana, neither picked his calls nor responded to a text massage sent to him to confirm the incident.
