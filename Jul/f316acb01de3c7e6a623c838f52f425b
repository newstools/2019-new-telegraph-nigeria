Bayelsa politicians battle for PDP, APC guber tickets  Pauline Onyibe reports on the intriguing battle within the Bayelsa State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over who flies the party’s flag in the forthcoming November 16 governorship election in the state.    I t is another election year in Bayelsa State after the 2015 governorship poll that was a keen contest between the incumbent governor, Seriake Dickson and a former governor of the state, Chief Timipre Sylva.  The poll, held on December 5, 2015 was the second test of might between the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC), after the March/April 2015 general elections. The first was the November 21, 2015 governorship poll in Kogi State. While the Kogi election was not without drama and intrigues as a result of the usual poor logistics, which electioneering in Nigeria is noted for, the death of APC’s initial candidate in Kogi State, Abubakar Audu, at a time he was coasting to victory, almost triggered a constitutional crisis as the 1999 Constitution (as amended) did not envisage such situation. The impasse over Audu’s death was however resolved, when the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) directed the APC to nominate another candidate as Audu’s substitution for the supplementary poll in 91 polling units, where elections were cancelled.  The case of Bayelsa was entirely different. The December 5 election was characterised by violence. Lives were lost and voting had to be shifted to the next day (December 6) as armed thugs disrupted the process in Southern Ijaw Local <img class="size-medium wp-image-227948 alignleft" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Bayelsa-Jostle-for-Dicksons-seat-hots-up.png?resize=300%2C147&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="147" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Bayelsa-Jostle-for-Dicksons-seat-hots-up.png?resize=300%2C147&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Bayelsa-Jostle-for-Dicksons-seat-hots-up.png?w=655&amp;ssl=1 655w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1">Government Area of the state.  But the rescheduled poll did not hold as armed thugs prevented the commission’s officials from deploying officials and materials. INEC, against this backdrop declared the poll inconclusive as votes from the council was expected to be the decider, being the largest of the eight local government areas of the state.  According to INEC’s updated register for the elections, the council had 120, 827 registered voters. Governor Dickson, who contested the poll on the platform of the PDP, was then leading in six of the seven local government areas declared by INEC. The governor polled 105,748 votes, while Sylva of the APC won in only one and had 72,594 votes, a margin of 30,154 votes.  The impasse was resolved a week later, when both candidates returned to the poll and it was the PDP that had the day. In what could be described as the stiffest governorship contest since the creation of the state in 1996, the incumbent secured a second term in office by polling a total of 134,998 votes to defeat Sylva, who garnered 86,852.  While the 2015 election is now history, it will amount to political gamble for any of the parties to rely on the variables that shaped it going into the forthcoming governorship contest given that politics remains dynamic.  For instance, the APC seized the opportunity of the 2019 general elections to make inroad into Bayelsa State that was hitherto under PDP’s grip. The ruling party at the centre was able to win a senatorial seat, two House of Representatives seats and four seats in the state House of Assembly.  Again, the fact that whichever way the pendulum swings in the forthcoming November 16 poll in the state will further strengthen the confidence of the two leading parties ahead of the 2023 general elections, will see both sides deploying all they could to either consolidate on what they have or extend frontiers.  Governor Dickson, who recently reasoned along this line, while speaking at a forum in Yenagoa, acknowledged that the battle for his successor is going to be a defining moment for the state.  His words: “The last governorship election is still fresh in the memories of Bayelsans. It was more than an election, it was a war. The 2019 governorship may not be any different. The stakes are high as some persons are desperate to capture the state regardless of how unpopular they are among the people.  “In their desperate bid to launch a deadly come back, they have begun to gradually disrupt security architecture in the state. This they have done by using their privileged positions against the people. In 2019, they are expected to be more daring, but as always, Bayelsans know them and in line with true Ijaw spirit, the people are ready to repel every attempt to circumvent their will.”  Though there may be justification for governor’s fears of reoccurrence of violence given the build-up to the poll, the question many political analysts and observers in the state have asked, is: Has the PDP presumed to be an Ijaw party done well in the state to deserve to be re-elected?  While the question can be answered by the people of the state, the belief in some quarters is that it is has been a mixed grill for Bayelsans in the second term of the Dickson’s restoration government. This, analysts say, if not properly handled may hamper the chances of PDP returning to the Creek Haven as Bayelsa government house is known.  At the moment, some notable political gladiators in the state, especially those of PDP extraction, have already picked expression of interest forms at the cost of about N26 million, despite the seeming division in the party.  The PDP in Bayelsa State has two camps; that of former President Goodluck Jonathan and that of Governor Dickson. While the former president seems to be supporting some aspirants, the governor has his own people. Though the party’s spokesman in the state, John Macbere, at a time said there is no truth in that, the fragmentation seems to be playing out now as the Dickson’s camp through the office of the Special Adviser to the governor on Political Affairs, Fyneman Wilson, recently mentioned some names being supported by the Restoration Government.  They are Kemela Okara, the current Secretary to the State Government, who is from Bayelsa Central and a son of Ekpetiama kingdom, where Arch. Reuben Okoya and Keniebi Okoko (also aspirants) are from. Another personality is the Chief of Staff, Government House, Talford Ongolo, who is from Southern Ijaw Local Government Area in Bayelsa Central.  Outside the governor’s camp are the likes of Douye Diri, the senator representing Bayelsa Central Senatorial District and a former Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Timi Alaibe who has already obtained the form to contest the PDP governorship primary election.  Wilson’s dropping of the names was on the heels of the fasting and prayers organised by the Restoration Government to choose the next governor of the state. But, some people are tempted to think that Dickson is technically trying to dislodge some those who have already obtained forms for the PDP primary election as he had repeatedly said that people cannot be outside watching, while others are busy making the party attractive only for them to come and pick tickets to become governor.  Dickson even at the last day of the fasting and prayers said the people of the state will not elect an ungodly person as their next governor.  According to him, the state will never again experience governance by cult elements as well as crude and brutal human beings, whose aim is bloodletting, killings and violence. He also restated his call to the people of the state to resist cultists who could use the temptation of political offices to lure the youth to dangerous practices.  His words: “Let me remind us of some of the very powerful pronouncements that our men of God and fathers of our faith have led us to declare for the past seven years and still counting.  One of the most important is that only a man after God’s heart, not a man who is not destined by God, who wants to take it by violence, no such person shall ascend the position of governor. Not one who does not subscribe, understand, submit to the authority and divine mandate of God over our lives shall ascend the seat of governor.”  Governor Dickson said that the essence of the three-day programme was to seek God’s guidance and control of the transition process to reveal his successor. He added that the governorship seat of the state had been handed over to God, which will make it impossible for cultist or anyone involved in occultic practices to occupy the position.  Before the latest development, about six Bayelsans have gone to pick expression of interest forms to contest the PDP’s governorship primary election, which is estimated to the tune of about N130 million. They are Keniebi Okoko, Joshua Maciver, Timi Alaibe, Benson Agadaga, Franklin Erepamo Osaisai and others that were gearing up before the announcement of the anointed candidates.  Alaibe, a former Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), who said he consulted widely before declaring his interest has vowed to run what he described as “Blue Ocean Economy” for sustainable development in the state if elected. His words: “I have had many consultations before declaring my interest.  The consultations are still ongoing. Essentially, my vision for Bayelsa is that of a shared economic prosperity for the people of the state. The vision is about the government as a social investor and the government as an enabler to invite private sector capital. “We are clear as to what we want to do in terms of our objectives.  As a PDP state, we want to retain Bayelsa. As such we are going to consolidate on the good, great work that our governor, Dickson, has done so far. We will improve on them. He has done well, especially in infrastructure development, health, education and we need a leader with that level of appreciation of project implementation, project management at top most level to be able to take up from where he would have stopped.  “You know I have the capacity. You know me as a peace advocate. I am a peace builder, I have network and that network I will use to bring to bear to support my state, both local, state, national and international network, both in public and private and at the appropriate time we will be dealing with multilateral organizations, given my background and you know that I have goodwill, my reputation and connection to achieve that. “So, those are the things I want to bring to the table to help my state grow and build on the good work that had been done and sustain the legacy of this governor and also ensure we try to unite our people under the umbrella.  “We will espouse our belief of using government as a social investment platform in the implementation of social infrastructural projects in security, health and environment. But more importantly, we will espouse our interest in using government as an enabler for the maintenance of a peaceful and conducive environment to attract private sector capital, experience and strategy in implementing accelerated economic development.”  For Dr. Osaisai, who believes that technocrats should be given a chance to pilot the affairs of the state, he has promised to bring his experience to berr in running the affairs of the state. Born on October 1, 1958 in Koluama, Osaisai is a nuclear engineer and energy scientist. He had his early high school education in his native Bayelsa State and graduated with distinction in the West African School Certificate Examination in June 1977.  He had his undergraduate training as a pioneer student at the University of Port Harcourt in the School of Chemical Sciences, and graduated at the top of his class and school, respectively, with a degree in Chemistry with a minor in 1981.   Buoyed by a merit graduate scholarship award, he received his engineering and graduate education at the University of California, United States, where he obtained his masters’ and doctoral degrees in Nuclear Engineering in 1984 and 1987, respectively, with some academic honours and awards which included the Chancellor’s Patent Fund Award and the Newhouse Foundation Fellowship. Dr. Osaisai commenced his professional and academic career at the University of California before returning to the University of Port Harcourt, where he had taught and researched in the fields of Nuclear Reactor Engineering, Energy Systems Integration, Numerical Modeling, Nuclear Instrumentation and Computational Transport Phenomena.  He was appointed as the pioneer Director- General/Chief Executive Officer of the Nigeria Atomic Energy Commission (NAEC) in April 2006.  Prior to this appointment, he was the Director of the Nuclear Technology Centre at the Sheda Science and Technology Complex, Abuja. On the reconstitution of NAEC to operate as a full-fledged Commission in March 2011, as provided for in its enabling Act, Dr. Osaisai was elevated and appointed as Chairman/Chief Executive of NAEC.  As Chairman/CEO of NAEC, he was responsible for the budgeting, staffing, coordination and supervision of the management and operations of seven national nuclear energy research centres, and coordinated international cooperation and educational outreach for manpower training and capacity building programmes in support of the national nuclear technology programmes.  Dr. Osaisai is an accomplished professional nuclear engineer, energy scientist and academic, as well as a consummate administrator. He is a Fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Engineering, the Nigerian Society of Engineers, the Nigerian Institute of Physics and the Science Association of Nigeria, respectively, and also holds membership of many other professional bodies, including the American Nuclear Society, the Institute of Nuclear Materials Management and the Chemical Society of Nigeria, amongst others.  He is also, currently, Nigeria’s Governor on the Board of Governors of the Vienna based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). He had also previously served in this capacity on the IAEA Board from 2006 to 2008 and had represented, and continues to represent Nigeria in various International High Level and Ministerial Conferences on nuclear power. He has been the National Liaison Officer of Nigeria to the IAEA since 2006.  He had also served as the National Coordinator, as well as the Chairperson of the African Regional Cooperative Agreement for Research, Development and Training related to Nuclear Science and Technology (AFRA). He also coordinated activities of the Vienna based Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) in Nigeria, including the management of the CTBT National Data Centre, and served as the Vice Chairperson for Africa of the Preparatory Commission of the CTBTO between 2009 and 2010.  He also served as a pioneer member of the AFRA High Level Steering Committee on Human Resource Development and Nuclear Knowledge Management. He is a member and currently, the Chair of the IAEA Technical Working Group on Nuclear Power Infrastructure. He had also chaired several international conferences and meetings on nuclear technology development and applications.  For Keniebi Okoko, a businessman and philanthropist, he became the first aspirant of the PDP to pay N21 million to obtain the expression of interest and nomination forms. Speaking after picking the forms, Okoko, who is an alumnus of the Harvard Business School and the University of Port Harcourt, agreed to sustain and expand the achievements of Governor Dickson in the education sector.  The indigene of Obunagha in Yenagoa said having served his people through the Keniebi Okoko Foundation; it was time to extend his service to the public.  He recalled that the foundation brought succour to the people by providing aids during the perennial floods, granting scholarships, payment of hospital bills for the underprivileged among others. As an aspirant, he said he was aware of the supremacy of the party, adding that in following the rules of the party, he decided to be the first to pick the forms in the entire state. Describing the PDP as the beacon of the revival of democracy in the country, he expressed confidence that the process of nomination during the primary election will be free and fair.  He said: “With the right infrastructure in place, good roads, steady power supply, reliable security in place, good hospitals, good and quality education, captains of industries and entrepreneurs will be comfortable and willing to come to Bayelsa and invest and jobs will be created through private sector participation. “Dickson has done very well in changing the face of education in Bayelsa State and one of the major things I want to do is to build on that.  The educated mind is a liberated mind. We also want to increase the quality and number of companies that come into the state and create the right environment for business to thrive.”  As it stands, it seems the PDP in Bayelsa State is divided against itself with so many persons gunning for the same position even as many are wondering why the incumbent governor is projecting three aspirants if he was sure of victory. Political pundits are envisaging that this will of course give other parties the opportunity to give the PDP a good fight PDP as the likes of Preye Aganaba and Senator Heineken Lokpobiri (the immediate past Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development), who just declared his interest to fly the APC flag are in the race to fly the APC flag. Also, former Governor Sylva is gearing up. With the fronting of not too popular aspirants by the PDP, analysts are of the view that APC may have my have a field day come November 16.
