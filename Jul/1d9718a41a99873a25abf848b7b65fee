Fire yesterday morning gutted the Bayelsa State-owned radio station, Glory FM (Radio Bayelsa) 97.1 in Yenagoa. The inferno consumed the live studio, the production studio, the accounts department and other vital offices before it was put out by men of the state fire service, some members of staff and other citizens. The Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Daniel Iworiso-Markson, told journalists during a visit to the station that the incident was a major setback to the government and people of Bayelsa State. Iworiso-Markson, who was in company with some members of the state media team, said being one of the most formidable media to disseminate information, the incident would affect the government and the people. The commissioner, however, promised that everything would be done within the shortest time “to ensure the station comes back on air”. Iworiso-Markson appealed for calm from the members of staff, loyal listeners and clients of the radio station.  He said: “It’s an unfortunate situation and we feel sad about it. Nevertheless, we have to move on. We will do what we can to bring the station back on air. It’s a pride to the state and we can’t afford to allow the people to be so disconnected for too long. “I thank sincerely those who were here early enough to help the firefighters to put out the fire and call on the staff not to be discouraged over this setback. We will surely get over it and be stronger and better.”
