Former Super Eagles striker, Barnabas Imenger, has cautioned Nigerian soccer fans against the act of continuous criticism of players in the national team, as he believes such always causes poor performances for the country, especially during major championships. Imenger added that soccer fans should understand that all the players want to give their best for the country whenever they are called upon, but stressed that it is not always that things go according to plan, hence the need for restraint and understanding anytime the lads appear to be struggling. The Algiers ’90 AFCON silver medalist added that he also faced the same scourge during his time in the Eagles, for which he also tried to give his best. Imenger stressed: “I am not happy when I hear people criticizing players. It is so sad that people do not want to know what players are facing. “All the time, they criticize our players, especially those that play in the national team as if they are not human beings like you. “It is not good, because it affects the team. There is no way a player will be able to give his best when he knows he will not be appreciated. “It is something I know, because I also played football for Nigeria, and I faced the same thing. Criticizing, criticizing, criticizing. It’s not good.” The ex-international striker pointed out that no professional footballer that wears the nation’s green-and-white colours will not always want to give his best, hence his charge to soccer fans to appreciate the players and to understand their plight anytime they play for the country.
