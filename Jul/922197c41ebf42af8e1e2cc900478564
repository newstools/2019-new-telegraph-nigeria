Salisu Maijigiri, the state Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Katsina State, told the Presidential Election Tribunal, on Tuesday, that his party’s presidential candidate in the February 23 election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, defeated President Muhammadu Buhari, in the state. Katsina is Buhari’s home state. Atiku and the PDP are challenging the victory of Buhari and the All Progressives Congress at the poll. A five-man tribunal led by Justice Mohammed Garba is hearing their petition. The petitioners, at the Day 4 of the presentation of their case on Tuesday, called as their eighth witness, Maijigiri, who said he served as the party’s collation agent in Katsina State for the presidential election in state. The case is still continuing.
