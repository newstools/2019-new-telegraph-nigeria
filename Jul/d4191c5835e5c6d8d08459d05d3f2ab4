The Senator Representing Delta North senatorial district, Peter Nwaoboshi has applied to the Federal High Court in Abuja to vacate an order of interim forfeiture of his alleged assets made on July 2, 2019. The presiding judge, Justice Taiwo Taiwo had in its ruling on an ex parte application filed by the Special Presidential Investigative Panel for the Recovery of Public Property, against the senator for non declaration of assets, issued an order for the interim forfeiture of 11 houses and 22 bank accounts linked to the Delta-North Senator.  However, in a motion on notice filed on July 5, 2019 by his counsel, Muhammad Katu, Senator Nwaoboshi argued that the court’s order of interim forfeiture of his assets constitutes an abuse of court processes, more so, that the court lacks jurisdiction on the matter.  According to Katu, his client had on June 8, 2019 obtained an order from the same court restraining the Chairman of the Special Presidential Investigative Panel for the Recovery of Public Property, Okoi Obono -Obla and the Inspector General of Police for maintenance of status quo on the matter as at 31st of May 2019, pending the final determination of the applicant’s originating motion on notice.  He therefore wondered why the court will order for interim forfeiture of his assets despite a subsisting order for all parties to maintain status quo on the matter.  Katu further argued that the same federal government through the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has also charged the senator before the same federal high court on the same subject matter on 13th April, 2018 with charge number FHC/ L/ 117C/ 2018, a case which he says is still pending before the federal high court.
