* Factions deny involvement Residents of Egbeda Local Government Area of Ibadan were on Sunday morning thrown into panic when two factions of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) members clashed. According to checks by New Telegraph, trouble started when a former chairman of the union in the state, Mukaila Lamidi (a.k.a Auxiliary), in company with some of his men and two officers of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) stormed the house of an estranged aide, Musliudeen Muideen, with some dangerous weapons. It was learnt from some residents around the area that while their victim was being beaten shooting was heard, prompting residents who heard the gunshots to flee. Auxiliary, however, said that the claim was not true, alleging that some members of the union, were out to paint him black in order to stop the Oyo State Governor, Mr. Seyi Makinde announcing him as the new NURTW Chairman. Auxiliary, who spoke through one of his aides, Alhaji Ahmed Raheem, said the allegation was an attempt to destroy his reputation, stating that as a peace- loving person, he would never engage in acts that would bring disrepute to the state. However the victim, Muideen while speaking with journalists on Sunday, said his house was invaded by six vehicles loaded with NURTW members and two NSCDC men brandishing dangerous weapons, stating that if it had been in the night, he would have been killed. He said that after he was beaten to the point of death and his family members traumatized, he was driven to the headquarters of the state Joint Security Task Force, and handed over to the State Commander.  Another member of NURTW who was also attacked, Kabiru Adekunle, said he bolted away from his house immediately he was informed by a source that the members of the union were heading towards his house.
