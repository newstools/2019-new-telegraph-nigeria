The Benue State Government, yesterday, gave mass burial to people that died in the Monday tanker explosion. Deputy Governor of the state, Engr. Benson Abounu, disclosed this to journalists after he visited and condoled with survivors of the disaster. The survivors were receiving treatment at different hospitals in Gwer and Makurdi Local Government Area of the state. Abounu said: “We have a good number of people who were burnt beyond recognition. This means that even their relations would find it difficult to identify them. We decided that for those in that group, we would give them mass burial near Ahumbe in Gwer East Local Government Area, where the disaster happened.” Abounu, however, said that any family member, who is able to recognise their beloved ones, were free to take and give them befitting burials. He said that a member of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), from Ogun State, who was also caught in the twin explosion, was receiving treatment in the state. Abounu described the degree of burns the survivors sustained from the disaster as alarming. He disclosed that the injuries ranged from between 30-90 percent for children and adults. He added: “The youngest of the survivors, who is about nine years old, is receiving treatment at a hospital in Aliade in Gwer East Local Government Area, while the other is about 11 years old and is being treated at the Federal Medical Center in Makurdi. On Tuesday evening, we had 96 patients in various hospitals in the state. We also experienced some mortality. Between Tuesday and Wednesday, we have recorded up to four deaths bringing to about 48 mortalities. We have over 90 survivors, who are receiving treatment.” He appreciated the services given to the victims at the Nigeria Air Force (NAF) base hospital. He also expressed the readiness of the state government to compliment the gesture through financial support even as the government had decided to foot the hospital bills of the patients.
