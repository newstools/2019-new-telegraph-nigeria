A 13-year-old pupil, Egbadon Overcome, was yesterday swept by a flood after a heavy rainfall in Edo State while on her way to school. Until her demise, Overcome was a Primary 3 pupil of Idumu Ague Primary School, Uromi, Esan North East Local Government Area of the state. It was learnt that the area got flooded during the rain. The flood was said to have been caused by diversion from a road that was under construction on new Agbor Road. Overcome’s remains were removed by officials of the Federal Road Safety Commission ((FRSC). The Chairman of the Edo State Universal Basic Education Board, Dr. Joan Oviawe, said she had deployed field officers to unravel the cause of the girl’s death. Oviawe, who described the girl’s death as unfortunate, said government, after discovering the cause of the deceased’s death, would prevent future occurrence. She said: “The Edo State Universal Basic Education Board regrets to announce the unfortunate death of Egbadon Overcome, a 13-year-old Primary 3 pupil of Idumu Ague Primary School, in Uromi, Esan North East Local Government Area of Edo State. “The Board has sent field officers to gather information on what transpired and the circumstances that led to the death of the pupil.
