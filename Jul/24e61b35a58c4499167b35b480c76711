A 30-year-old barber, identified simply as Tersur, yesterday died after rescuing a drowning pig from the gutter in front of his shop in Gboko East Local Government Area of Benue State. Tersur’s shop, ‘One-Step Barbing Shop,’ is located at Orshi Kur Street. A witness said Tersur collapsed and died moments after rescuing the pig. Tersur abandoned his work, when he saw the pig in the gutter in front of his shop, being swept away by the heavy flow of water. “Tersur refused to listen to entreaties to allow the pig to perish. He got a helper and they both swung into action; the pig was saved after both Tersur and the helper were drenched. What ordinarily looked like a good gesture from Tersur turned to sorrow when he slumped immediately after bringing the pig out of the gutter,” the witness said. Tersur was rushed to a private hospital around the vicinity, but doctors at the facility confirmed him dead. Those close to Tersur said his death was as strange as it was sudden. They, however, attributed it to the will of God.
