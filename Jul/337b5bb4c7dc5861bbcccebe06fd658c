Apple has revealed its earnings for the last quarter of 2019 and the numbers are as astronomical as you would expect. The tech behemoth clocked up $53.8 billion (£21.2 billion) of revenue in the last three months, which is a year-on-year increase of 1%. However, it says that profit actually fell slightly. Don’t feel too bad for Apple though; the net profit was still $10 billion (£8.3 billion) for the quarter. Interestingly, the iPhone sales seem to be the only part of Apple’s business facing some trouble. While the iPhone remains the biggest category, the smartphone now represents half of the firm’s sales at 26 billion dollars (£21.4 billion), down from 29.5 billion dollars (£24.2 billion) the previous year. Part of that is believed to be because we’re all holding onto our phones a bit longer between upgrades and there’s some really decent alternatives coming out of China for a much more reasonable price. Meanwhile, services – which includes the likes of Apple Music, iCloud and Apple Pay – along with the Mac, iPad, wearables and home and accessories all experienced growth. The chief executive called the results ‘promising’, highlighting the continued success of the services part of Apple, which took sales of 11.5 billion dollars (£9.4 billion). The sector looks set to take a bigger chunk of Apple’s growth in the future, with a new movie and TV streaming platform Apple TV+, the Apple Card, as well as a gaming subscription product Apple Arcade, all set to launch soon. “This was our biggest June quarter ever – driven by all-time record revenue from services, accelerating growth from wearables, strong performance from iPad and Mac and significant improvement in iPhone trends,” Apple boss Tim Cook said. “These results are promising across all our geographic segments, and we’re confident about what’s ahead. The balance of calendar 2019 will be an exciting period, with major launches on all of our platforms, new services and several new products.” *Courtesy: metro.co.uk
