  Armed men yesterday abducted the Provost of College of Health Technology, Mkar, Gboko, Benue State, Mr. James Terwase Ihongo. The abduction came less than 24 hours after gunmen kidnapped the wife of an Igbo businessman, Mrs. Blessing Arinze Chukwudi. Ihongo was abducted in his house opposite the School of Laboratory on Katsina-Ala Road, Mkar, Gboko about 7.30p.m., after his captors trailed him from his office to his unfenced residence. The College of Health Technology was established by the NKST Church. Registrar of the college, Mr. Emmanuel Ikpilakaa, confirmed the incident in an interview with our correspondent in his office. He said: “The four heavily armed men came in an ash Toyota Corolla popularly known as ‘Duck Yash.’ Ikpilakaa urged the state government to act fast to stop the rampant cases of kidnapping in the state. The registrar also prayed for the quick and safe release of the provost. Wife of the provost, Mrs. Monica Ihongo, said the well-armed abductors forced their way into the seating room. She said: “They seized my husband after collecting all our phones and money. They took him to the bedroom for some minutes before they took him away.” On his part, a senior official of the college, Mr. John Terhemen Tseeneke, said the frequent abductions of NKST staff might force all the staff to go on strike. The Chairman, Caretaker Committee of Gboko Local Government Area, Mr. Iorver, who confirmed the incident, said he had already visited the family of the victim and also met with the security agents on how to get the victim released from the hands of the abductors. At the NKST Secretariat, President of NKST Synod, Revs. Dominic Anza, and Secretary, Ephraim Shir, confirmed the incident. They said all the NKST pastors worldwide had gathered at the headquarters to pray for the safe release of the provost.
