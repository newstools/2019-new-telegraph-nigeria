From Chukwu David, Abuja The Senate, Wednesday, gave an additional one week to its ad hoc committee investigating the alleged assault on a woman in a Shop in Abuja, by Senator Elisha Abbo, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain, representing Adamawa North. The Senate, had two weeks ago, set up the seven-member committee to investigate the Senator over the alleged assault and report back to the chamber within two weeks, a period that elapsed exactly Wednesday. However, the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Samuel Egwu (PDP, Ebonyi North), raised a point of order, citing Order 43 of the Senate Standing Orders, to make personal explanation on the assignment given to his committee. In his submission, Egwu told the Senate that the committee had not concluded its assignment, rather, he sought the approval of the Senate, for an extension of time, to enable the investigative Panel conclude the work and submit its report for the Senate’s consideration. Egwu said that they could not conclude the investigation because the matter had been taken to court by the police, and that it would be sub judice for the committee to continue with the investigation. He said that the committee had resolved to wait till after the police and the court finished with the matter before continuing with its assignment. However, the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, disagreed with Egwu’s request, stating that the Senate was not going into the criminal aspect of the matter but to investigate alleged misconduct of the Senator. At this point, the Committee Chairman, request for extension of time by one week, a demand that was unanimously approved when he put it to voice vote.
