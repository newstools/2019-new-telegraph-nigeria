Indigenes of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) yesterday petitioned the Senate over their exclusion from President Muhammadu Buhari’s ministerial list recently submitted to the apex legislative chamber for confirmation.   They also accused President Buhari of violating the provisions of the 1999 Constitution, which stipulated that Abuja should be treated as if it were one of the states of the federation.   This decision of the lawmakers was sequel to a petition by the aborigines of the nation’s political capital, through their representative in the Senate, Senator Philip Tanimu Aduda.   In his brief comment on the petition, Aduda recalled a subsisting Court of Appeal ruling in January 16, 2018, directing the Federal Government to ensure the inclusion of an indigene of the FCT in ministerial appointments.  He also noted that there had not been any counter appeal by the Federal Government to fault the FCT Appeal Court decision for a ministerial slot for indigenes of the territory.   He said: “Mr. President, my constituents had thought that after the announcement yesterday that we are going to screen the last batch of the ministerial nominees, there would be an announcement that there is a ministerial nominee from the FCT, but we do not have one. “Therefore, they have asked me to submit a petition before this Senate, so that as the state House of Assembly of the people of the FCT, you can look into the petition
