R. Kelly has been arrested in Chicago on sex trafficking charges, according to reports. The singer, 52, is said to have been detained by New York police detectives and Homeland Security Investigation agents. A 13-count indictment includes charges of child porn and obstruction of justice, TMZ reports. Officials are expected to release further details Friday, News 4 reports. The R&B star pleaded not guilty to 11 new sex assault charges last month. He hid his eyes behind dark sunglasses and made several strained expressions as he entered Chicago’s Leighton Criminal Courts Building on June 26 flanked by a large entourage for a status hearing in relation to a sexual assault case. Inside the court room, prosecutors handed over a DVD allegedly showing Kelly having sex with an underage female. The footage – thought to have been filmed in the 1990s – was obtained by lawyer Michael Avenatti back in February, and reportedly shows the singer sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl, reports themail.com. In total, Kelly has now pleaded not guilty to 21 sexual abuse charges since February for his alleged abuse against four different women, three of whom were underage when the alleged crimes took place. Among the 11 new counts are four counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault, which carries a sentence of up to 30 years in prison.
