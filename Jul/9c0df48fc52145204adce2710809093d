 Technical Adviser of Edo Queens Football Club of Benin, Gabriel Adejo, has called on his players not to be distracted by their exit from the ongoing Aiteo Cup competition. Addressing the players in Lokoja after their 1-0 loss to Nasarawa Amazons in the quarter-final encounter, he said that there are a better days ahead, stressing that they must put the defeat aside and concentrate on the league.  He said: “Whatever has happened, we have to give thanks to God for everything. Our girls did their best in the match against Nasarawa Amazons.  Football is full of surprises, it was just a silly mistake by my goalkeeper that cost us that game. You will agree with me that our opponents were  not fantastic, we saw the way Lokoja fans were hailing Edo Queens players. It is just unfortunate that it ended that way.  “We have put that behind us, we are now focusing our attention on the league which commences on the July 17, 2019. I have told my players to get ready for a big challenge; our focus is to win the league. In last years’ Aiteo Cup, Edo Queens got to the quarter-finals too and lost to a bigger force.  You see in the game of football, particularly in this part of the world, many things play out, but as managers we just play our role and let God do the rest for us. This is not time to trade blame; we are going back to our camp to strategize on our plans because we won’t want to miss out on both sides.  “I want to use this medium to commend the state government on their support and also appeal to them not to give up. We are very committed to doing our best to ensure that Edo Queens win laurels for the state in this coming league season.”  Meanwhile, Edo Queens will tackle Dream Star Ladies from Lagos on July 17, 2019 in their first away league match. They are in Group B alongside Heartland Babes of Owerri and Adamawa Queens of Yola
