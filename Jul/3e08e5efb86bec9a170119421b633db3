Several people are dead and more have been injured after a truck they were on crashed en route to a festival in the Philippines. Nine children were killed and 16 others were injured when the vehicle lost control on a downhill road and flipped on its side. Some were thrown clear of the wreckage but others were crushed to death when they became pinned underneath. The driver was among those injured in the accident in the town of Boljoon in the central Cebu province. Police investigator Nelson Saquibal said they were from two village schools who were on their way to a cultural, health and sports festival in the town centre. He said that locals ran to the aid of the victims of the crash and they helped police and firefighters to pull the victims from under the wreckage. Deadly road accidents are common in the Philippines because of weak enforcement of traffic laws, rickety vehicles and inadequate road safety railings and signs especially in the countryside, reports metro.co.uk.
