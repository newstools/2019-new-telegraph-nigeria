Along with the many positives of her career, notable Ghanaian actress, Yvonne Nelson, has come out to point to a part that is not all that progressive. According to the 33-year-old mother of one, acting made her unserious with anything that had to do with education and scholarship as disclosed in an interview with Joy FM.  “I would go on stage every Saturday in SHS. I had to rewrite some papers. I was so into entertainment that I didn’t take my schooling serious.  You can easily mess up and not make it to university. I regret not paying attention to my books so when I see kids of today, I tell them to pay attention to their books,” she said.  Despite stating her regrets, the “Swings” actress expressed her pride in being able to graduate. And perhaps in a bid to make up for failing to pay full attention to her studies back then, she has stated her willingness to go back to school, this time for her Masters degree.
