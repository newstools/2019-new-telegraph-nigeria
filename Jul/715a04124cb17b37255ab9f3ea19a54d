The Sports Writers Association of Nigeria, Lagos chapter has described the demise of veteran sportscaster, Akinloye Oyebanji, as a monumental loss to the sports section in Nigeria.   Lagos SWAN chairman, Debo Oshundun, in a statement on Sunday said late Oyebanji’s wealth of experience in sports circles would be greatly missed.   He also prayed the family, close associates and friends would find the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.  “He was a professional to the core. I know he was a role model to most of us during his active days at the Nigeria Television Authority. He presented programmes with a lot of dexterity and it is so unfortunate that he is no more with us but we cannot question God,” Oshundun stated.    Oyebanji, 62, retired as Director Nigerian Television Authority (NTA).  He served the NTA for 35 years in different capacities, including being a sports broadcaster, and later as General Manager (Sports).  He retired as Managing Director of NTA Properties at the authority’s headquarters in Abuja.
