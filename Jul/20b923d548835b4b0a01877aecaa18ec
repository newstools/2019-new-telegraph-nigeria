Eight people have lost their lives while attempting to evacuate water from a septic tank at a building located at Igogoro in Igboeze North Local Government Area of Enugu State.  Six of the eight victims were reported to be indigenes of Amachalla community that shares boundary with Igogoro village. A witness of the Monday incident said the victims might have died of asphyxiation following inhalation of smoke from the water pumping machine used in evacuating the water.  “The water pumping machine was started and lowered into the pit, so the fume was all trapped inside the tank. The operator entered the well and collapsed, maybe as a result of the fume (carbon monoxide). Others entered to help in rescuing the first victims, but they also got trapped and died.  This is exactly how carbon monoxide operates,” the witness said. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Ebere Amaraizu, said that a yet-to-be-identified worker in the site had in the process of trying to evacuate water from the flooded tank, got trapped inside the tank. He said: “After waiting a while for him to come up, others started going to help. But they were all trapped there and soon became unconscious.  They were later brought out by sympathisers and policemen, who raced to the scene. The victims were rushed to General Hospital, Ogurute in Igboeze North Local Government Area, where the doctor on duty con firmed them dead.”  The Commissioner of Police, Suleiman Balarabe, has expressed shock over the incident, which he described as unfortunate. Amaraizu said that Balarabe had directed a full scale investigation into the incident, just as the bodies had been deposited at the mortuary of General Hospital, Ogurute.
