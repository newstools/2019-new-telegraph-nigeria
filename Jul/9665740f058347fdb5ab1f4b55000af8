The leadership of Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, described the unfolding political drama in the state House of Assembly as embarrassing and sad.
Chairman of the PDP in the state, Chief Dan Orbih, who stated this, noted that the unnecessary power show amongst the gladiators is not in the interest of the state.
Orbih pointed out that the House which ought to parade men of honour is now going to be occupied by uniformed armed men.
Orbih who spoke against the backdrop of the pronouncement by members of the House of Representatives that Governor Godwin Obaseki should issue a fresh proclamation for the House within one week else the Police and Department of State Security (DSS) take over the Assembly complex, insisted that the poor and lamentable state of affairs in the state underscores the need to vote out the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led government.
He said: “We are embarrassed by the ugly and unending crisis in the APC controlled Edo State House of Assembly. This unnecessary power show is not in the interest of the state. The Assembly which ought to be a House of honourable men is now going to be occupied by uniformed armed men.
“We have always maintained that Edo State deserves better than what the APC is offering. The poor and lamentable state of affairs in the state underscores the need to vote out the APC government in the state. A party and government that cannot manage a House of 24 persons cannot manage the state.
“We call on all concerned in the Assembly crisis to stop this ego trip and blame game and face the serious business of good governance in the interest of the people. Edo State is too sophisticated to be used as political guinea pig of supremacy between party and government strength.
