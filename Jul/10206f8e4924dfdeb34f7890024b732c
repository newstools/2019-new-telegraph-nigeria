The Nigerian Air Force (NAF), yesterday, said air operations conducted within the Munhaye axis in Zamfara State on Tuesday, left over 20 suspected bandits dead. According to NAF, the air strikes followed intelligence reports indicating that bandits were gathering at the location, to possibly plot attacks on soft targets. Director of Public Relations and Information (DOPRI), Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, who made the disclosure in a statement, said the air component of ‘Operation Hadarin Daji,’ upon receipt and establishment of the information, deployed an Alpha Jet to hit the location. Daramola said: “The Air Component of ‘Operation Hadarin Daji’ has neutralized no fewer than 20 bandits at a location near Munhaye in Zamfara State in air strikes conducted on July 2, 2019. The operation was executed sequel to credible intelligence reports, indicating that scores of bandits had assembled at the location for a meeting, supposedly with the intention of attacking innocent civilians in the surrounding communities.” He added that: “The Air Component therefore scrambled a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha Jet to attack the location, which is about 15 kilometres from the border with Katsina State. Upon arrival overhead the area, the Alpha Jet observed over 30 bandits, attempting to flee the location whilst firing at the approaching attack aircraft. The Alpha Jet engaged the bandits with effective fire, neutralising 20 of them. The NAF, working in consonance with other security agencies, will sustain its operations to flush the bandits out of the Northwest part of the country.”
