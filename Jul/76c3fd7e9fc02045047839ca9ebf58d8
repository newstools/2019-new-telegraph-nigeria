I had not visited Egypt before this year’s AFCON and the impression I have got before I arrived here was that communication wouldn’t be a problem but I was wrong.
It is given that Arabic is Lingua franca here but information I got was that English is their second language.
Except at the Cairo Airport where many of the staff members speak English, it’s hard for me to converse with the locals when I got into the city.
It is tough to board buses, buy food, get stuffs from the groceries.
Thanks to Google Translator, I manage do my daily runs here by simply using this application. I type whatever I want to do in English which will be translated to Arabic then show it to whoever I want to converse with. Thanks to technology.
