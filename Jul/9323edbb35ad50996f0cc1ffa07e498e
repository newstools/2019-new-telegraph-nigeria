Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State has reiterated his commitment to supporting security agencies to protect lives and property. Zulum stated this yesterday when he visited Gajiram, headquarters of Nganzai Local Government Area of the state, to commiserate with the people over the murder of 60 villagers by Boko Haram insurgents. The governor, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), said government would not relent until permanent peace was restored in the state. Condemning the attack, Zulum called on the people to be vigilant and cooperate with security agencies in their communities.  He prayed for the re pose of the souls of the deceased and the families, the fortitude to bear the loss. Zulum also visited Specialist Hospital, Maiduguri, and sympathised with persons who sustained injuries in the attack. Meanwhile, the Chairman of the local government area, Mr. Muhammad Bulama, told journalists that the insurgents attacked Badu village and killed over 60 persons, while 11 others were wounded.  He said: “Two weeks ago, Boko Haram insurgents attacked Badu village but the attack was repelled by the villagers and members of the vigilance group. “The villagers resisted the attack, killed 11 insurgents and recovered 10 AK47 rifles in the encounter.  “On Saturday, about 11.40a.m., the insurgents came on a reprisal mission, attacking mourners at a grave yard in the area, killing over 60 persons and injuring 11 others.” Bulama added that the wounded had been taken to the Specialist Hospital, Maiduguri, for treatment. Efforts to get reactions from the military on the attack proved abortive, as the Deputy Director, Army Public Relations, Operation Lafiya Dole, Col. Ado Isa, did not respond to inquiries sent to him through Short Service Message (SMS).
