Barely one week after the video in which she detailed her allegation of rape against Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA) came to light, Busola Dakolo, has filed a formal complaint to the police.  The complaint by Mrs Dakolo, wife of singer, Timi Daokolo, will facilitate investigation by the police and likely prosecution in court. The mother of three made the shocking revelation in a video interview with YNaija.  The allegation against the Abuja- based cleric, according to Mrs Daokolo, who is a celebrity photographer, set the media space on fire, with many Nigerians including celebs, having their say online. In his reaction, however, the embattled preacher denied the allegation, adding that he had never raped a woman all his life, even when he was an unbeliever.  But with many people including pastors, motivational pastors and others calling on him to step down, Fatoyinbo announced his decision to step down on Monday. He had been present in church on Sunday although he didn’t preach, with his wife, ‘Modele, saying her husband is not a rapist.  It is not the first time Fatoyinbo has faced a sex scandal, as Ese Walter, a former member of COZA, accused him of sexual relations back in 2013. Although her outburst was not related to rape, she said it was more of psychological manipulation and left her shattered beyond description years after she had sexual intercourse with the pastor every day for a week during a trip to the United Kingdom by Fatoyinbo.
