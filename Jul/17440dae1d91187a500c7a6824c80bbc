 Eunisell Boot 2019 winners, Ibrahim Sunusi and Mfon Udoh, were very delighted after receiving their N2m Cheques and Eunisell Boot replicas each for their feat during the Eunisell Boot awards night. Both goal kings were hosted at a glittering ceremony, in Lagos, where they were crowned on Friday night at Raddison Blu Hotel, Ikeja-Lagos. “It was a special night for me and one that I won’t forget in a hurry. I have never been to or witnessed such a reception before, more so, one done to honour a player in Nigeria’s domestic league,” Sunusi said. “To be honest, I see this kind of event on television when top European players are rewarded. I was more than excited when I was presented my N2M cheque and Eunisell Boot. “I want to dedicate the Eunisell Boot Award to my mother, family, coaches, teammates at Nasarawa United and the media.” Udoh said: “The night is not a night for long speeches, I want to use this medium to say a big thank you to Eunisell for deeming it fit to reward goal scoring excellence in the domestic league.” Group Managing Director of Eunisell, Chika Ikenga, stated that the Eunisell Boot is an important corporate social responsibility initiative for Eunisell. He said: “Like all Nigerians, we are passionate about football and whilst we salute our talented players who play for some of the world’s top clubs abroad, we believe that there is an opportunity to raise the standard of the game at home and not only keep out talents here, but in addition, attract international players to play in Nigeria.” The duo scored 10 goals each.
Eunisell values a goal in the Nigeria Professional Football League at N200,000.
