Following cancellation of examination fees by Oyo State Governor, Engr. Seyi Makinde, scores of pupils in public and private primary schools and junior secondary schools yesterday turned out in an unprecedented large number to write the State’s placement examination into JSS1, popular called ‘Common Entrance’ and Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) as well as the Competitive Entrance Examination into Schools of Science in the State. in a release made available to New Telegraph in Ibadan yesterday, signed by Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism, Dr. Bashir Olanrewaju said that the exercise which was monitored by the Head of Service of Oyo State, Mrs. Ololade Agboola, was certified satisfactory in comparison to the number that had sat for the same examinations in the past when those who could not afford the payment had stayed away. Agboola said it would be on record that the unprecedented number of pupils who sat for each of the three examinations had indicated that the state government had done the needful towards reducing the number of out-of-school children in the state. Until Makinde took oath of office, Oyo State was one of the States with the highest number of out-of-school children in the 2019 report of the Universal Basic Education Commission. Agboola said:  “We have seen the direct impact of the declaration by Governor Makinde against payment of school fees and examination fees for public primary and secondary schools in Oyo State. The number is unprecedented as confirmed by the education administrators, and even parents that came with their wards to the examination centers were too happy for the gesture of this administration. “We are using this opportunity to call on teachers and school administrators to key into this laudable effort of the State government to bring back to school, the children that have left and are engaging in things inimical to their own future and the future of our nation.”
