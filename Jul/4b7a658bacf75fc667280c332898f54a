  Gunmen terrorising Niger, Kebbi and Katsina states have abducted at least 18 traders. The traders were travelling from Pandogari town in Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State to Bassa village for the weekly market in the town before they were abducted. The incident occurred on Saturday.  The traders were in an 18-seater bus when they ran into a blockade by the gunmen who shot sporadically into the air and thereby creating fear among the traders.  A witness, who pleaded anonymity, said yesterday that the traders, who are mostly women and a few men, were rounded up, forced into a waiting bus and driven into the bush far away from where the incident occurred. The witness said it was not the first time that such incident had occurred in the area.  He said: “It has now become a regular business that no one is doing anything about.” It was learnt that the gunmen had collected all the mobile phones belonging to their victims and had been making contacts with their families, telling them the ransom to pay to secure their release. The kidnappers were said to be asking for between N200,000 and N500,000 from each trader, depending on their ‘personality’.  “They are asking the relations to pay the ransom at a location as far as Funtua town in Katsina State to avoid being tracked by the police. Some of the traders are already complying,” a source said..  The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mohammad Abubakar, said he only heard of it. He said: “We have heard of such incident as you heard it but no official report has been made to us. “We are investigating the matter, we will get back to you when we get official report.”
