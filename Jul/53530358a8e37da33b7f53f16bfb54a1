It is hard to get many Egyptians on the streets who speak English but I got a shocker when I saw one who spoke some words of Yoruba. Yes, Yoruba Language!
I made a short trip from Alexandria to Cairo Wednesday morning; after I finished with my business I decided to rush back to my base instead of spending a night in the Capital.
At the bus station, I tried to make enquries from a driver who simply said ko si aye (no more seat).
I was shell-shocked to hear an Arab spoken my Motherâ€™s language. But before I could ask him his name and engage him in a rather short conversation he had zoomed off.
Oh I really wish to see this Yoruba-Arab again.
