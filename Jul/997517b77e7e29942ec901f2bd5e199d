•Coach may unleash Osimhen, Onyekuru on Desert Foxes •We’re ready for Algeria’s antics, says Omeruo   Super Eagles Manager, Gernot Rohr, has said they must not make mistakes against their semi-final opponents, Algeria, warning his strikers to convert their chances in the encounter.  The coach said the Eagles had survived big battles in the competition but their last four clash is their potential biggest game so far. He said the intensity of the game would be so high and team with fewer mistakes could emerge winner.  “We have analysed our opponents as well as our performance in the competition; this is going to be another tough game, we have put the result against a very tough South Africa behind and we are hoping to win this one,” he said.  “We must not waste our chances, we must take every opportunity that we have, we must also not make mistakes because the Algerians are dangerous.” The coach said his team had the advantage of having one day more to rest after their opponents played their quarterfinal match on Wednesday a day later that when Nigeria played. Rohr also hinted that he might hand Victor Osimhen and Henry Onyekuru an opportunity to play in the competition against Algeria. The two forwards scored 45 goals in between them for their clubs in Europe and Nigerians are surprised they are yet to see action in Egypt.  Meanwhile, Super Eagles defender, Kenneth Omeruo, has said they are ready for the antics of the Algerian players when the two sides meet in the match taking place at the Cairo International Stadium at 8pm.  The North Africans are noted for displaying dirty antics as demonstrated by Algerian player, Ramy Bensebaini when he attempted to con the referee in sending off a Cote d’Ivoire striker, Wilfred Zaha in their quarterfinal match on Thursday. Bensebaini’s action has alerted the Nigerian team and Omeruo said they would be smart enough to get over the antics of their opponents.
