David de Gea will sign a new long-term contract at Manchester United that will make him the best-paid goalkeeper in the world, Sky Sports News claims.  The Spain international has been offered between £350,000 and £375,000 per week to remain at Old Trafford.  Negotiations between United and De Gea have been taking place for over a year, with the 28-year-old’s current deal due to expire at the end of the season.  De Gea has been named United’s player of the year on a record four occasions since arriving from Atletico Madrid eight years ago.  He started for United in their 1-0 win over Inter Milan in the International Champions Cup on Saturday.  Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the United manager, gave a positive update on the goalkeeper’s future ahead of their pre-season match against Leeds last Wednesday.  Marcus Rashford is the latest big-name player to extend their United deal under Solskjaer, signing a four-year deal with an option for a further 12 months which will see him earn £200,000-a-week.
