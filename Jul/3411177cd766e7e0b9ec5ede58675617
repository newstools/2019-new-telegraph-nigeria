The Federal Government, 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) incurred additional N560 billion debt in the first three months of this year, the Debt Management Office (DMO) has declared. This brought the country’s total domestic and foreign debt to N24.9 trillion as at end of March 2019. Compared with the debt figure as of December 31, 2018, which stood at N24.387 trillion, the first quarter 2019 figure represented 2.3 per cent increase. According to latest debt figures released yesterday by the DMO, the country’s total foreign debt stood at N7.8 trillion ($25.6 billion) while domestic was N17 trillion. Out of the total domestic debt, the Federal Government alone owed N13.1 trillion, while the 36 states and FCT owe N3.9 trillion. DMO stated that the debt, which rose by N560 billion, was accounted for largely by domestic debt which grew by N458.36 billion, while external debt also increased by N101.64 billion during the same period. Further analysis of the domestic debt showed that Lagos had the highest debt of N542.2 billion, followed by Rivers with N225.5 billion, Delta N223.4 billion and Akwa Ibom with N199.7 billion. Figures for other states showed that Abia’s domestic debt stood at N62.8 billion, Adamawa N97.1 billion, Anambra N33.4 billion, Bauchi N93.3 billion, Bayelsa N133.3 billion, and Benue N96.9 billion. Others are Borno N78.2 billion, Cross River N167.2 billion, Ebonyi N55.5 billion, Edo N86.3 billion, Ekiti N118 billion, Enugu N55 billion, Gombe N76.8 billion, Imo N97.8 billion, Jigawa N38.2 billion, Kaduna N93.2 billion, Kano N121.3 billion, Katsina N67 billion, Kebbi N67 billion, Kogi N96.6 billion, Kwara N59.5 billion, Nasarawa N89.9 billion, Niger N43.4 billion, Ogun N97 billion, Ondo N56.9 billion, Osun N147.7 billion, Oyo N94.1 billion, Plateau N98.5 billion, Sokoto N36.5 billion, Taraba N68.5 billion, Yobe N26.9 billion, Zamfara 61.9 billion and FCT N163.5 billion. The DMO, however, indicated that the debt figures for Anambra, Borno, Ebonyi, Ekiti and Lagos were as at December 31, 2018, while that of other states are as at March 31, 2019. Analysis of the country’s foreign debt showed that $11.01 billion of the debt was multilateral; $344.63 million was bilateral (AFD) and another $2.75 billion bilateral from the Exim Bank of China, JICA, India and KFW while $11.17 billion was commercial which are basically Euro bonds and Diaspora Bonds. According to DMO’s figures, the country spent a total of N128.6 billion ($357.2 million) to service its foreign debts in Q1 2019. In servicing domestic debts, the country spent a total of N650 billion between January and March. “In relation to the Debt Management Strategy, the ratio of domestic to external debt stood at 68.49% to 31.51% at the end of March 2019. The total public debt to GDP ratio was 19.03% which is within the 25% debt limit imposed by the government,” DMO management explained in a statement. The DMO boss, Mrs. Patience Oniha, had, on several fora, noted that borrowed funds were channelled to finance projects, fund budget deficit and meet maturing obligations. Oniha had also explained that some foreign debts were borrowed so as to refinance treasury bills because of the short tenor. A National Bureau of Statistics’ data on Nigerian states and federal debt stock data as at 31st December 2018 reflected that the country’s foreign and domestic debts stood at $25.27 billion and N16.63 trillion respectively. The debt agency has been active on domestic and Euro bonds. On June 14, 2019, it listed the dual and triple tranche Eurobond issues on Nigerian domestic exchanges. The Eurobonds, which were issued respectively in February 2018 and November 2018, were oversubscribed, demonstrating the on-going confidence of international capital market investors in Nigeria’s investment story. The Eurobonds represent the use by government of long term lower cost funds to finance infrastructure while also creating opportunities for domestic borrowers. The listing of the latest Eurobond issues will provide benchmarks for corporations which intend to issue Euro bonds in the international capital markets and further deepen the domestic capital markets by ensuring that the securities can be traded easily by domestic investors. Meanwhile, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the February 23, 2019 election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has expressed concern at the increasing nation’s debt profile. Atiku, who noted that Nigeria’s national debt at N12 trillion on May 29, 2015 when President Muhammadu Buhari took over, was “very healthy,” regretted that the figure doubled to N24.3 trillion by December 2018. In a statement by his Media Adviser, Paul Ibe, the former vice president blamed this on the profligacy of the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration. ” As alarming as this is, what is more troubling is that between December 2018 and March 2019, the administration of General Buhari added an additional and unprecedented N560 billion debt to our national debt profile,” Atiku stated. According to him, “The period the latest borrowing occurred was during the 2019 electioneering, when monies were freely distributed by officials of this government in the name of Tradermoni and other election gimmicks that were discontinued after the election. “We find it inconceivable that Nigeria could have had such unprecedented borrowings in the midst of almost unimaginable sorrowing, which resulted in our nation becoming the world headquarters for extreme poverty and the global capital of out-of-school children, even as we slipped in the Corruption Perception Index of Transparency International.” Atiku said he has the moral authority to call those who are turning Nigeria into a beggar nation to halt the drift into unsustainable borrowing, “as someone who headed the National Economic Council (NEC) that paid off Nigeria’s entire debt under the visionary leadership of President Olusegun Obasanjo.”We cannot continue to borrow to pay salaries and support luxuries. Already, over 50% of our revenue is going towards debt servicing, not even debt repayments. “We raise this alarm as responsible citizens and call on other lovers of Nigeria to speak up as we have no other nation to call our home, but Nigeria.” National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, told New Telegraph that the party has no comment on the allegation of rising debt profile of Nigeria from Atiku.
