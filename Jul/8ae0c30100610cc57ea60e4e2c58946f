Nigeria imported some 2.65 million tonnes of wheat valued at N487 billion ($1.33 billion) in the last six months, New Telegraph has learnt. The imported grain was brought into the country from Russia, the United States, Canada and Australia at the global price of $503.5 per tonne. It was learnt that the current wheat production in the country has remained at 60,000 tonnes since 2015, while wheat imports are forecast this year to hit five million tonnes. Nigeria is currently experiencing over five million tonnes or 98.86 per cent wheat deficit, which has already affected the Federal Government plans to cut wheat importation by 60 per cent by 2025, as the country failed to produce 1.5 million tonnes locally per annum. Government had said in 2012 that it would increase national production from 300,000 metric tonnes to about two million metric tonnes per annum by 2019. It also promised to generate one million jobs in the rural areas, but government has failed to meet domestic production as consumption grew from 4.8 million tonnes in 2017 to five million tonnes in 2018. However, trouble started between 2013 and 2014 when local output suddenly fell from 350,000 tonnes to 60,000 tonnes. Last week alone, data obtained from the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA)’s shipping position indicated that three vessels were jostling to offload 120,875 tonnes of the grain at the Lagos Port’s terminals – Greenview Development Nigeria Limited (GDNL) and Apapa Bulk Terminal Limited (ABTL). Currently, wheat imports into the country attract a duty of 20 per cent, while flour is charged a 100 per cent duty. At GDNL, Genco Bourgogne would berth with 27, 300tonnes, while Desert Victory and Desert Hope would offload 41,725 tonnes and 51,850 tonnes respectively at ABTL terminal. Last June, two vessels also offloaded 88,994 tonnes of the grain at the Apapa Bulk Terminal Limited (ABTL). At the terminal, Desert Oasis discharged 39,882 tonnes, while Genco Province came with 49,112tonnes Also, the terminal took delivery of 170,580 tonnes of the grain with  Desert Melody laden with 86,130tonnes; Desert Victory, 36,250 tonnes and Desert Calm,48,200tonnes in May 2019. Also, Genco Bourgogne ferried 33,050 tonnes to GDNL in the period. At Standard Flour Mills (SFM), Cresty Coastal and Bosphorus Prince offloaded 11,000 tonnes and 12,100 tonnes respectively. In March, Lagos Port terminals received 226,730 tonnes of the grain from six ships, following huge demand by Flour Mills of Nigeria, Dangote, Honeywell, Olam, Seaboard Group and other wheat millers. Worried by the cost of shipping the grain to the country, the Premium Bread makers Association of Nigeria (PBAN) in 2018 urged the Federal Government to review downward the 15 per cent levy charged on the grain in order to help reduce the price of flour. The association noted that the 15 per cent reduction in the levy on the grain would lead to a substantial reduction in the price of flour by millers.
