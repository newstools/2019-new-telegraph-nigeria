Suspected bandits, yesterday, attacked the home of the former deputy speaker of Ekiti State House of Assembly, Right Honourable Olusegun Adewumi. The bandits were said to have invaded Adewumi’s residence in July 2, at about 2am. The gunmen forced their way into the compound and then discovered that Adewumi was not around. It was gathered that this would be the third time Adewumi’s residence had been attacked. An eyewitness said: “They didn’t cart away any property. They were more interested in the whereabouts of the former deputy speaker. I was in Aramoko when I received a call from someone living close to the Honourable’s house. The caller said that I should come to Erinjiyan at dawn. A few minutes later, I received two other calls, from two different people. Immediately it was daylight, I rushed to Erinjiyan. I was told that the men were fully armed, but no item was taken.” It was gathered that Adewumi and his family are presently on vacation in Canada. It will be recalled that on March 30, 2013, Adewumi lost his mother, Mrs. Juliana Adewumi, who was murdered alongside Mr Ayo Jeje aka Murphy, a politician. Jeje was one of the political aides to Adewumi. It was gathered that the death of Juliana, triggered the death of his father, Pa Gabriel Ojo Adewumi, a devout Christian community leader and politician. The witness said since the gruesome killing of the mother, the former deputy speaker’s home had again been attacked twice
