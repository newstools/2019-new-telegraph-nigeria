 There is palpable unrest in the camp of the Super Eagles ahead of their round of 16 clash with Cameroon after two keys players clashed with Manager Gernot Rohr.
Our correspondent learnt that striker Odion Ighalo and defender Leon Balogun clashed with Rohr after the coach openly criticised them for the loss to Madagascar on their last group game.
Sources in the squad confirmed that the two players had heated altercations with the coach at their Helnan Palestine Hotel camp when he used harsh words in castigating them for the loss.
“Ighalo felt terribly bad when he heard about what the coach told the media that the team didn’t have strikers who were good enough. It infuriated him even the more when the gaffer mentioned similar thing during team’s meeting.
“Balogun too clashed with the coach, insisting the manager should not have singled him out for blames because of the mistake he made.
“I don’t think these players will play a part in the competition anymore but some officials of the Nigeria Football Federation have come in to resolve the problem, ” the source explained.
The players are aware of the situation and are also supporting their colleagues against the handler who was recently warned by the NFF to talk less.
