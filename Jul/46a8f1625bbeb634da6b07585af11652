The Senate has resumed the screening of ministerial nominees with Saleh Mamman, a nominee from Taraba State, before the Senators. The nominee introduced himself as an electrical engineer. “I started from the scratch. I worked with the Taraba state government for 29 years before I retired as assistant director in charge of designs,” he told the Red Chamber. Commenting, Orji Uzor Kalu, Senate Whip, says the nominee is not a good orator but he “knows the job”. “He might have stage fright.” Kalu adds. The screening, which is day five of the exercise and which began last Wednesday, is expected to be concluded today. President Muhammadu Buhari had submitted a 43-man list to the Senate for approval last week.
