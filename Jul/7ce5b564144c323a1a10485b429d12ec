It was a showcase of the best of Africa in art, architecture, design, as well as food, real estate and travel at the Main Expo Hall of Olympia London, Kensington, last month by WISH Africa in a bid to promote a more positive image of Africa and Africans on the continent and in the diaspora.  Focusing on four countries from four corners of the African continent: Morocco (representing the North), Kenya (representing the East), Nigeria (representing the  West) and South Africa (representing the South), the expo featured African culture, commerce and development through educational cultural installations, a marketplace showcasing premium African goods and panel discussions by renowned industry experts.  Speaking at the event, Yinka Shonibare CBE commended the organizers and the panellists for a successful maiden edition.  “Congratulations to WISH Africa for providing a great platform for the promotion of African creativity. I am proud to have participated in a highly educational series of talks and presentations which promoted and celebrated African enterprise. It was a pleasure to learn about the innovative ideas coming out of Africa from Architecture to Art, business and fashion. I hope such a productive gathering will continue well into the future,” she said.
