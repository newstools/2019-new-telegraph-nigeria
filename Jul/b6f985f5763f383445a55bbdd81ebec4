A family of Mr. Teryima Abomnger, a popular yam dealer in Gboko Local Government Area of Benue State, has been thrown into mourning as two of his sons got drowned in the Nguembi stream.
The incident occurred near St. Thomas Catholic Church in Gboko South. The victims, whose names were given as Masters Shater Abomnger (10) and his Terhide Abomnger (eight), got drowned while searching for used bottle water containers to sell. Shater and Terhide are Primary 5 and 3 pupils of Aunty Ayam’s Nursery and Primary School in Gboko.
A witness, Mr. Joseph Orban, told our correspondent that Shater slipped on the bank of the stream and was drowning when his younger brother, Terhide, dived in to save him and also got drowned.
Orban said efforts he and others made to save the two kids failed. He, however, said that with the assistance of two other young men, the victims’ bodies were recovered and taken to the Gboko General Hospital where doctors confirmed them dead.
The witness called on both Gboko Local Government and the state government to come to the aid of the community by filling up the deep gulf created by the erosion which he had become a death trap. Orban disclosed that within his 15 years of stay in the area, over 30 victims had been drowned in the stream. Father of the deceased, Abomnger, who hails from Mbayongo in Vandeikya Local Government Area, said he and his wife had left the children at home with their siblings in a search of daily bread, and only received the shocking news from a friend through a phone call. In a swift response, the Chairman, Caretaker Committee of Gboko Local Government Area, Mr. Jacob Iorver, promised to take immediate measures by filling up the death trap caused by the erosion to avert further occurrence.
He prayed God to give the family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.
