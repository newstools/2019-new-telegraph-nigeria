The Cross River Government has been presented with “Literacy Champion Award 2019” by the Universal Learning Solution (ULS), a Jolly Phonics Training partner to the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC). Speaking yesterday during the award presentation ceremony in Calabar, the state capital, the Project Director of ULS, Ms Louise Gittins, said the award was in recognition of the state government’s commitment to the Jolly Phonics project. According to her, through the support of the government, the pupils in public primary schools in the state could now read and write with confidence. She also recalled that the state emerged as the best performing Jolly Phonics State in the country in the 2019 phonics screening exercise, organised recently by Universal Learning Solutions. She noted that out of 56,000 Primary One to Primary Three pupils assessed across the country, the pupils in the state emerged the best in literacy assessment. Ms Gittins added: “We did a jolly phonics screening exercise across all states of the federation; schools were chosen randomly and we did not choose the best schools. “We assessed 56,000 pupils from Primary One to Primary Three across the country. We wanted to look at the results of pupils in primary three just to see if they were able to read.
