A retired Commissioner of Police, Mrs. Diseye Nsirim-Poweigha, has called on federal and state governments to increase the funding earmarked for the Nigeria Police Force, which she said is the surest way of improving security in the country. Nsirim, an All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant in Bayelsa State, who stated this yesterday at the APC National Secretariat after obtaining her Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms, said the problem with the police is not about community, state or federal policing but funding. She cited the Bayelsa State security situation as an example of poor funding of the police, saying Governor Seriake Dickson is not funding police properly, noting the effects of such on security in the state. “The Bayelsa State governor is not providing enough funding for police and other security agencies. If there must be security as expected, government must spend more money on the security agencies. Security is everybody’s business. “What we actually need is proper funding of the police and not issue of community, state or federal police,” she said. Nsirim, who was Deputy Director (Security) of the APC Presidential Campaign Council said, if elected governor of Bayelsa State, she would make sure lives and properties are well secured in the state using her vast experience during her time as a police officer
