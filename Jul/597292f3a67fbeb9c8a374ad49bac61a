 …suspects allegedly stole jewellery, custom-made walking stick, other valuables  Policemen attached to Operation Puff Adder, Bayelsa State Police Command, at the weekend arrested four relations of former President Goodluck Jonathan over alleged N300 million theft.   The four suspects, two brothers of the former First Lady, Mrs. Patience Jonathan, and two ladies believed to be the former President’s relatives, illegally entered Jonathan’s house at Otuoke community in Ogbia Local Government Area of the state, stole jewellery, custom-made walking stick and other valuables worth over N300 million.  A source claimed that a substantial sum of money was also stolen from the house.  The two brothers to former First Lady are identified as Mowsor Princewill Oba and Boma Rasheed Oba. The other two female suspects were yet to be identified at press time.  It was learnt that one of the suspects, said to be a senior official of the Aridolf Resort, Hotel and Spa owned by the former First Lady, had duplicated the keys to the rooms where the valuables were kept and looted the valuables.  A source said that when some domestic staff of the former President discovered, they informed him.  Jonathan was said to have invited the police to arrest the suspects and to recover the valuables.  A source close to the former first family said Mrs. Jonathan was also shocked by the theft.  The suspects were said to be showing signs of remorse and regretted their actions.  “They are already making useful confession to the police and some monies from the proceeds are being recovered,” a source said.  A police source said the suspects were the first family’s relations entrusted with the house but betrayed the trust and looted the home.  The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Asinim Butswat, refused to comment on the arrest of the suspects.
