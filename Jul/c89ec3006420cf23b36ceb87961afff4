Speaking further on the conduct of the examinations, she assured Lagosians that the results would be released in good time in order to enable successful candidates resume into their respective schools at the beginning of the new academic session in September.
She, however, noted that admission would be strictly based on candidates’ performance and vacancies in schools, saying: “The parents and guardians are therefore urged to prepare their wards effectively for the examinations and ensure punctuality at examination venues.”
The Ministry had shifted the dates for the examinations in its bid to replace the manual registration with e-Registration of candidates so as to further ensure a hitch-free and transparent process that would be devoid of malpractice and other forms of irregularities.
