Following the controversy that trailed the election of principal officers in Bauchi State House of Assembly which produced two speakers, the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday said it would not allow ‘minority to rule over majority in the Assembly,’ adding that they were prepared to reclaim their mandate very soon.
The disclosure was made by APC Zonal Vice-Chairman, Bauchi Central, Zakari Dogo, Secretary, Bako Hussain Disina and the Vice-Chairman, Dr. Mohammed Hassan Tilde, when they received APC youth parliament in their office.
On his part, Dogo said: “We are prepared to reclaim the leadership of the state Assembly, because as you all know, politics is game of numbers and God in His infinite mercy put the PDP in the executive seat and gave APC the majority in the House of Assembly. God knows better why he arranged it that way and we would not allow the minority to rule over the majority.”
He assured supporters of APC that the party was not an opposition party in the state, but that its members were ‘co-party,’ “those of you who know how an aeroplane flies, know that there is always a co-pilot and they have their schedules, and we should be the pilot in the legislature while the governor is the pilot of the executive and what we need is a positive intercourse between the two arms of executive and legislature for using programmes that will benefit the populace of Bauchi State.”
Dogo said they were not doing what they were doing just to oppose blindly, any positive programmes of the government, but they were doing it to improve the lives of people of the state.
In his remarks, Vice-Chairman of the party in the state, Dr. Mohammed Hussain Tilde, said the speakership election was not free and fair and they were set to reclaim their mandate.
