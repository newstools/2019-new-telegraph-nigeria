The House of Representatives yesterday urged the Ministry of Aviation to liaise with relevant agencies to enforce aviation safety standards in the country. The agencies include the Nigeria Airspace Management Agency, (NAMA), the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), the Accident Investigative Bureau (AIB) and the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET). The resolution of the House was sequel to the unanimous adoption of a motion sponsored by Hon. Chris Azubogu (PDP, Anambra). Leading debate on the motion, Azubogu recalled the recent near mishap involving a Boeing 737-500 belonging to Air Peace on June 22, while about to land. He said that the Air Peace Flight No P47291, which had about 94 passengers on board, was said to have taken off from the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, to the Port Harcourt International Airport, Omagwa, Rivers State. He added that the aircraft, on landing overshot the runway. According to him, the incident was caused by the flood on the airport’s runway due to a downpour earlier in the day. He said: “The House is worried that poor weather condition has been the reason for most of these crashes, even the mishaps at recent times. Over the years, air travel has become an easier means of transportation not only to the people of Nigeria but to people of the world at large. “As a nation, the Federal Government has the obligation at every point to make the aviation industry work better for the citizenry.” While approving the motion, the House also urged the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria to ensure that all aircraft in Nigeria were adequately maintained and certified airworthy before commencing operation, in order to prevent further ordeals. They added that the NIMET and FAAN should prevail on aircraft owners to keep strict adherence with the rules of weather condition while flying, while mandating the House Committee on Legislative Compliance, when it is constituted, to ensure compliance.
