National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), has vowed to collaborate with various youth groups in the South-East zone to resist establishment of Fulani vigilance groups in the zone. The pledge came amidst furore generated by Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria’s (MACBAN) demand to establish Fulani Youth Vigilantes in all communities in the zone.  NYCN in a statement yesterday described the proposal by MACBAN as a prelude to Igboland’s invasion. The youths’ body, however, condemned the proposal which it said was a confirmation of the rumoured hidden agenda to ‘Fulanise’ Nigeria.  The statement signed by NYCN National Vice President, South-East, Prince Chibuike Echem, said an emergency meeting of NYCN with various youth bodies in South- East had been scheduled for next week in Enugu to take a common position on the worrisome development.  NYCN which vowed to partner with youth organisations in the South-East to defend the zone against any invasion wondered why the federal government was still treating herdsmen with kid gloves despite their status as the fourth deadliest terror group by the United States of America.  The statement reads: “This is a prelude to invade the region by Fulani Herdsmen. “The U.S. government has emphatically categorised the Fulani herdsmen as one of the worst terrorist organisations in the world. “It is unfortunate that the Federal Government have treated this group with levity even as their notorious activities in the North especially North Central and North-West being that of agony and a litany of woes.  “The Igbo nation cannot condone such organisation in their backyard. We will partner with all interest groups in Igbo land especially Association of Community Youth Leaders in the South Eastern states to nip this move in the bud.
