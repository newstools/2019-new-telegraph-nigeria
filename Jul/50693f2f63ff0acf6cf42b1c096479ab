A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Ondo State, Chief Fola Dabo, has called on politicians to render service with dedication and integrity. Dabo spoke in Igbekebo, headquarters of Ese-Odo Local Government Area, when he received the state’s Chairman of the party, Engr. Ade Adetimehin and members of the State Working Committee (SWC).  The APC chieftain, according to a statement issued by the state’s Publicity Secretary, Mr. Alex Kalejaye, said that it takes integrity to win trust, confidence, and consistent loyalty of the people.  He said: “You must be passionate about serving the people; you must do this with integrity and sincerity. “You must be steadfast and promote selfless service to the people; positions and gains will come thereafter.” The party chieftain said the secret of his success in political sojourn was his foresight and “good philosophy about life.”  Dabo urged the Chairman to remain focused and be more committed to building the chapter, and ensure a united party ahead of future elections. “You must mend all fences within the party, and unite all members for them to be on one page, so that you can lead the State to another electoral success,” he admonished.  Earlier, Adetimehin had told the octogenarian that he led the SWC to the area to discuss with leaders and executive members of the party on ways to enhance the strength of the party. Adetimehin said the task of rebuilding a party was enormous, saying “the process has begun”. The party boss also encouraged the party executive and leaders from Ese-Odo to hold regular meetings to discuss issues and challenges, with a view to proffering solutions.
