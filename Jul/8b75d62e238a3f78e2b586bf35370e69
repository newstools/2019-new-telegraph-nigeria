…as Man United beat Inter to  continue strong pre-season   P aul Pogba will reportedly wait for a move to Real Madrid because the midfielder is ‘desperate’ to work under manager Zinedine Zidane. The Frenchman, who returned to Manchester United in 2016, told reporters last month that he wanted a “new challenge” elsewhere – a notion since underscored by his agent Mino Raiola. United are in no mood to sell Pogba, whose contract at Old Trafford expires in 2021, and will not budge on their asking price of £170m for the midfielder. According to The Mirror, Pogba is willing to wait for United to grant him a move because of a deep desire to work under fellow countryman Zidane. Since publicly laying down his terms, the 26-year-old has travelled with the United squad on their pre-season tour and impressed during wins over Perth Glory and Leeds United. Real are reportedly prepared to offload five senior players – including Gareth Bale and Isco – to fund a swoop for Pogba in this window. Meanwhile, Manchester United continued their preparations for the 2019-20 campaign with a 1-0 win over Inter Milan in the International Champions Cup on Saturday. Having started their pre-season with victories over Perth Glory and Leeds United, the Red Devils made it three from three with Mason Greenwood’s late goal seeing them overcome Inter in Singapore.
