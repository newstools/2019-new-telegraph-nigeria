Africa Initiative for Governance (AIG) yesterday announced the recipients of the third round of the AIG Scholarships. Every year, since 2017, AIG according to a statement from the company, has awarded fully funded Scholarships to young, outstanding West Africans from all backgrounds who are passionate about the public sector, to pursue the Master of Public Policy at the Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford. After their study at Oxford, AIG Scholars are expected to return to their home country and apply their learning experience as change agents in their country’s public sector. The 2019/2020 AIG Scholarship recipients are Babafemi Adebola (Nigeria), Onyekachukwu Erobu (Nigeria), Nasir Mohammed (Nigeria) Kwame Sarpong (Ghana) and Hakeem Onasanya (Nigeria). “I am very impressed with our third cohort of AIG Scholars”, said Mr. Aigboje Aig- Imoukhuede, Founder and Chairman of Africa Initiative for Governance. ”All five of them represent West Africans of great potential. Three qualities are common to all of them – strong intellectual ability, leadership and a passion for public service. It takes a strong value-system to want to serve the public good and these five individuals have demonstrated a compelling desire to do so”. In June 2016, AIG signed a five-year partnership with the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford, based on a shared vision of improving the world through good governance and public leadership. In each year of the partnership, AIG makes available five full Scholarships for graduate study at the University of Oxford.
