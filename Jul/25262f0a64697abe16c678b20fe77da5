Public Health experts have called for increased mental awareness and education to help reduce rising cases of depression and suicide in Nigeria. They made the call while speaking across various platforms on recent suicide cases in Nigeria, suggesting actions to reduce the occurrences.   Speaking on a radio programme, Dr. Chinomso Egemba, a global health advocate who works with Avon medical practice, identified depression as a major cause of suicide. Egemba described depression as a medical condition, a psychological state of unhappiness or low morale, which lasts longer than several weeks. It may include ideation of self-inflicted injury or in extreme case, suicide.   According to Egemba, depression is usually caused by a decrease in the level of serotonin, a chemical in the brain, which serves as a contributor to feelings of well-being, and happiness in human. She therefore advocated for an increased awareness and education from the government and the private sector.   “We have to call on the bodies responsible which includes the government to increase the level of mental health awareness in Nigeria and set up toll free lines and counseling centers across the nation so that people battling depression can call or visit for help” Egemba advised.   In her remarks on another health programme, another expert, Dr. Chioma Nwakanma, a public health advocate and digital media strategist, said common health problems such as depression and anxiety affect one in four people and it may not be easy to notice.   Meanwhile, Dr. Tajudeen Abiola, a neuro-psychiatrist with the Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital, Kaduna, advocated for deliberate education and awareness programme to increase the awareness and level of understanding around what constitutes mental health issues. By this, friends and families may quickly identify the indicators and take the necessary steps.
