The Forum of State Chairmen of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has endorsed Waziri Bulama, an Architect as the National Secretary of the party.  The Forum gave the endorsement in Abuja on Thursday after its meeting. According to a source, Bulama addressed the state chairmen in Abuja on his ambition to occupy the position of the National Secretary of the party.  The source explained that the chairmen were pleased with Bulama’s vision for the party. Other groups that have endorsed Bulama, who was Deputy Director General (Coordination) of the APC Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) to replace the outgone National Secretary, Mallam Mai Mala Buni, include President Muhammad Buhari Support Organization (BSO).  Speaking further, the Forum source said that the chairmen lamented the lack of activities in APC National Secretariat. The source said: “As you can see, APC does not seem to be in government. The opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is still occupying spaces everywhere.  “We feel that a substantive National Secretary of the party would make the party busy and bring more positive attention to the party. “In this light, the State Party Chairmen have given their nod to Bulama to occupy the position after interacting with him.”
