 T here are lots of reasons a wine can go bad. Poor bottling, microbial contamination and storage problems are just the beginning. Each of these issues has specific signs to look for, which makes it easier to tell a wine that’s gone bad from a wine that’s just not to your taste.   Has a strong vinegar quality: This is the smell of volatile acidity and acetic acid, which usually develops in wine after exposure to oxygen. But rogue yeasts can create this flaw in the winery.   Has a damp basement, moldy cardboard or wet dog odour: A sign of TCA contamination, aka ‘cork taint’. TCA stands for 2, 4, 6-Trichloroanisole, which is a harmless, potent-smelling compound that most often occurs when chlorine-based cleaners come into contact with wood. Even in minute amounts (as in parts per trillion), it can affect the way a wine smells and tastes. If present in a barrel or winery equipment, entire lots of wine can be affected– meaning the cork is not always the culprit.   Smells of rotten eggs, onions, cabbage: Wines that got too little oxygen during the winemaking process can develop volatile sulfur compounds, including ones called mercaptans. There’s no mistaking this flaw, even if you’ve never smelled a rotten egg.  These wines are said to be ‘reduced,’ meaning it was fermented without enough oxygen. Fortunately, this flaw often disappears shortly after the wine is opened. If it doesn’t, you can add something copper to your glass (such as a pre-1982 penny), which reacts with sulfur compounds and can magically eliminate the stinky smell.
