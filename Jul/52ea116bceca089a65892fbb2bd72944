Worried over the rising spate of insecurity across the country, an Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ochie-Igbo has called on the federal government to tackle the multifarious cases of the scourge, describing insecurity as the bane of societal growth and development.
The group, also known as Odinala Cultural Heritage Foundation, while briefing newsmen on Monday, urged the Federal Government to take deliberate steps to reassure Nigerians of their safety as most Nigerians across geopolitical regions of the country, seem to be contemplating self-help as an option owing to the rampaging insecurity in the country.
The National President of the group, Dr. Chukwuma Orji represented by the Board of Trustees Chairman, Okoro Chinedum Benedict, stated that Ochie-Igbo since its inception in 2016, has been proffering solutions to contemporary issues in the country by reaching out to the people and preaching peace across ethnic divides.
He said that pursuant to this, the group had created a research team that recently visited the Oni of Ife and other elite groups to chart a way forward in the interest of Nigeria.
“The idea is mainly to renegotiate our togetherness. Mind you, the problem is not the Igbos or any other region, it is a national issue.”
