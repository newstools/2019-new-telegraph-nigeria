F ollowing the appointment of Ijaw indigenes into the board of DESOPADEC and other agencies in Delta State, Ijaw people in the state yesterday said they were dissatisfied with such appointments, demanding for the establishment of Coastal Area Development Agency (CADA) for sustainable development of the area.   Ijaw in the state, while renewing their call for the establishment of coaster area development agency, also appealed to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa and the House of Assembly to urgently consider the establishment of CADA in coastal communities in the state to give them a sense of belonging.   Speaking during a press conference at Benikrukru, Gbaramatu Kingdom in Warri South-West Local Government Area of Delta State, Sheriff Mulade said such a bill for the agency would further help in addressing issues of infrastructure, housing, potable water, sanitation, internal roads and commercial fishing, using a better platform.   He commended the governor for appointing indigenes of the coastal areas and urged him to focus on the needs of the people in the coastal communities by supporting productive measures and ensuring the creation of CADA.   He asserted that no amount of government appointments can address and completely eradicate the development deficits in the coastal communities.   He said: “The diverse ethnic groups of Itsekiri, Ijaw, Urhobo and Isoko, who reside in the coastal communities, are anxiously waiting for Governor Ifeanyi Okowa and members of the Delta State House of Assembly, to urgently meet the demands of the coastal communities so that their names would be remembered.”
