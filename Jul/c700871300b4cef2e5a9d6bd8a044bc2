Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) has congratulated the newly appointed Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kolo Kyari on his new appointment. The group said that the office positions him to bring about greater transparency and accountability in NNPC’s management of Nigerian oil and gas revenues.  The transparency body, headquartered in Oslo, Norway, stated in a congratulatory letter dated June 27 to Mallam Kyari that it looked forward to working with the new NNPC GMD to build on his earlier engagement in the EITI’s targeted effort on commodity trading transparency, adding that the initiative had contributed to the global momentum in the extractive industries across the world.  A release by NNPC Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Mr. Ndu Ughamadu, said that EITI had already extended an invitation to the newly appointed NNPC GMD who would assume office on July 8 to join its targeted effort on State Owned Enterprise (SOE) transparency initiative, which it noted provided a veritable avenue for sharing best practices as it also  goes a long way in contributing to shaping evolving global norms in the extractive industries. The body said its Secretariat was ready to provide support for NNPC’s efforts to achieve disclosure of information on its management of Nigeria’s oil and gas revenues in accordance with the standard set by the global transparency organisation.
