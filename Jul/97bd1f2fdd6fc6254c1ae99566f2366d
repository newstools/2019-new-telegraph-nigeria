 Recuperating ex-international, Christian Chukwu, has told the Super Eagles of Nigeria that his spirit will continue to be with them as they continue their quest for a fourth Africa Cup of Nations currently going on in Egypt.  The former national team captain, who recently returned from London where he went for medical treatment, said he has been watching the Eagles from the start of the competition. “I have been watching the team right from the start of the AFCON and I can say it loud that they have improved,” he said. “Even though they started the AFCON slowly, they have really grown into the competition.  “They should go all out against Algeria and get the result so as to move a step closer to the title. “They have defeated the defending champions, Cameroon and also South Africa, they must continue the good run with a win against Algeria.”
