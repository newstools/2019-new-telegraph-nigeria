Just like our leaders wait until many young people take to robbery and other crimes, the people of Judah tried to arrest the irresponsible actions of Samson when it was too late. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was convicted of terrorism in the U.S.  There are over 500,000 terrorist suspects Farouk’s father had reported him to the U.S embassy two months or so before he was caught trying to bomb a USbound passenger plane. In my column then in Sunday SUN newspaper, the following are the excerpts of my publication concerning a young man, Farouk who attempted a suicide mission: The several injuries from the battles with Philistines, betrayal from his people and much marital heartbreak from his so called sweethearts did not make Samson retrace his steps to God.  The evil plan planted in Farouk’s mind while he was outside the shores of Nigeria manifested in his attempt to bomb a plane with 289 people on board in Detroit, Michigan. Farouk wanted to end his life in the aircraft like Samson did in the land of Philistine.  Like Samson who had strong survival instinct until later in life, Farouk’s action is also strange to African culture and probably the result of intense brain washing in the Middle East that this action would give him automatic ticket to heaven.
