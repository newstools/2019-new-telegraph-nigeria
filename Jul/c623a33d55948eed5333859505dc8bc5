The Ogun State Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal on Tuesday adjourned proceedings till August 19 for the adoption of final written addresses by all parties. This followed closure of the defence by the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the petition challenging the victory of Governor Dapo Abiodun in the March 9 gubernatorial election in the state. The petition “EPT/OG/GOV/01/19” was filed by the Allied People’s Movement (APM), governorship candidate, Hon. Adekunle Akinlade, and his party. Akinlade had alleged that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was wrong to have declared the APC candidate as winner of the governorship poll. Abiodun, who is the second respondent, had on Wednesday, last week, through his lead counsel, Prof Taiwo Osipitan (SAN), closed his defence after having called 32 witnesses who gave evidence before the tribunal. When the hearing resumed yesterday, the counsel to APC, Dr Paul Ananaba (SAN), closed the defence after having called three witnesses who were cross-examined by other lawyers.
