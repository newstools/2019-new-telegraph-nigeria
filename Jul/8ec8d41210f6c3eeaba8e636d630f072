Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) yesterday apprehended a man who was sighted around the airfield of the Lagos airport.  This came four days after a Nigerien, Usman Adamu, beat security architecture to crawl out and climb an Azman aeroplane. A FAAN official, who pleaded anonymity, told New Telegraph that the man was apprehended by security operatives when he was seen walking into sensitive areas of the airport. The man was said to have been taken to ‘Tango city’, a ‘detention’ area of the airport until he was taken away by officials of Lagos State government.  The police were invited but later declined to arrest the man, which made the officials of Lagos State government to whisk him away. But spokeswoman for FAAN, Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu, described the intruder as a deportee. He said: “I just confirmed that it was a deportee that was caught hiding inside the new Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) terminal and not an intruder.”  Many people spoken with admitted that security around the airport is porous going by the vast expanse of bush around the airport. Many people had been caught in the past farming and hunting inside the area of the airport that are not visible to people and airport security officials. There are so many gaping holes on the airport wall around Shasha and Ejigbo, Lagos suburb where people pass through to sensitive areas of the airport.  There are also broken walls on the perimeter fence around former Punch Newspapers office at Mangoro, Ikeja, where intruders pass through into the airport.
