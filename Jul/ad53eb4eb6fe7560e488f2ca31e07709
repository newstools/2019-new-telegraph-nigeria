Celebrated Nigerian singer, Abolore Adegbola Akande, better known as 9ice, has voiced his opinion on the rape accusations against Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly which is fiercely discussed across the country today. In an interview with Goldmynetv, 9ice said that rapists should be killed, stressing that no man has any reason to rape a woman if she refused him. He said there are so many commercial sex workers out there that could be patronised at cheaper rate, rather than raping a woman. Speaking in Yoruba language, he said: “No to rapist oooh. ladies are plenty naa, don’t you have mouth to toast a lady, are you mad. If I see a rapist I will kill him. it shall not be well with rapist, they won’t prosper. Even if you cannot ‘toast’ them, 5k, 10k, 20k, they are plenty at Ikeja. Rapists should be killed. What is wrong is wrong… a rapist is worse than being a robber,” 9ice said.
