The 2019 edition of the Africa Investment Forum presents a good opportunity for South Korean investors to explore bankable projects in critical sectors, industry players said yesterday.
The Forum − Africa’s own investment marketplace for accelerated economic transformation – is scheduled for November 11-13 in Johannesburg, South Africa.
According to a statement issued by the African Development Bank (AfDB), during a roadshow in Seoul, a Forum delegation met with representatives of the Export-Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM), the Korea Overseas Infrastructure & Urban Development Corporation (KIND) and the International Contractors’ Association of Korea (ICAK), who said the Forum was an important opportunity for the South Korean private sector.
“We have been able to discuss how the Africa Investment Forum represents a great platform for South Korean companies’ business development. Consulting firms are eager about meeting new clients and to share their best practices. Korean project sponsors want to see their projects discussed in boardrooms, while investors are very keen on partnering with the African Development Bank to access its pipeline of bankable projects,” said Tadashi Yokoyama, Head of the Asia External Representation Office at the Bank.
“We are very confident that with the help of KEXIM and KIND, the South Korean delegation will come in greater numbers this year.”
The roadshow was followed by bilateral meetings where South Korean companies were exposed to investment opportunities presented by the Forum.
The press release said that a delegation of 20 investors and project sponsors from South Korea attended the inaugural edition of the Forum in Johannesburg, adding that a South Korean project sponsor was able to present a deal in the pharmaceutical industry in West Africa during a boardroom session.
