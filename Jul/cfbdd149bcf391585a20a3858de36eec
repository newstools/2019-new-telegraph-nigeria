G overnor Abubakar Sani Bello has charged Niger Tornadoes Football Club of Minna to give its best when it confronts Kano Pillars Football Club at this year’s AITEO Cup final billed for Ahmadu Bello Stadium, Kaduna.   The governor, in a press release signed by his Chief Press Secretary (CPS), Mrs Mary Noel Berje, said the Minna-based club should not be intimidated by the Kano side being last year’s runners-up and they too were a finalist in 2017 just three years back.   He said that the whole state is solidly behind the team, hoping that the club gets the trophy it lost in 2000.  “Tornadoes needs this trophy and I know the team is adequately motivated to go for the kill, we are praying for their victory and we will be at the stadium to cheer them to victory.   “Kaduna State is home on both sides and enough support will be given to Tornadoes as they are regarded to be the ‘underdogs,” he said.   He urged the team not to be deterred, that it dropped to the second-tier league after last football season, promising that the team will get all support it deserves to quickly return to the elite league in the country.
