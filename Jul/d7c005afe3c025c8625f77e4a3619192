 Nigerian underwriters have sustained their interest in real estate investment as the commitment has continued to experience increase despite the harsh economy under which they operate.
According to the balance sheets prepared by the regulator, National Insurance Commission (NAICOM), five underwriting firms failed to pick interest in the blossoming real estate sector.
Findings revealed that a total of 43 firms invested in various assets including real state, equipment, goodwill, government securities, short term investment, shares related companies, among others.
According to the breakdown, Anchor Insurance Co. Limited invested N970 million; Consolidated Hallmark, N809.22 million; Custodian and Allied, N3.08 billion; Equity Assurance, N301.40 million and Fin Insurance, N 494 million. Guinea Insurance invested N1.57 billion; International Energy Insurance, N2.35 billion; KBL, N2.093 billion; Law Union and Rock, N1.37 billion; Linkage Assurance, N92 million; Mutual Benefits, N56 million and NEM Insurance, N442.55 million.
Others are Nigerian Agriculture Insurance Corporation, N4.01billion; FBN, N105 million; Old Mutual General, N988.77 million; Prestige Assurance N2.28 billion; Royal Exchange Assurance, N3.74 billion; Sovereign Trust, N1.18 billion and Staco, N1.52 billion. Similarly, Standard Alliance, invested N1.30 billion; Sterling Assurance, N1.06 billion; Universal Insurance, N1.79 billion; Saham Unitrust, N321.49 million; Wapic Insurance N539.93 million, and Unitykapital, N676.20 million.
The list also includes NSIA Insurance, N1.14 billion; AIICO, N990 million; Great Nigerian Insurance, N4.56 billion; Industrial and General Insurance, N15.91billion; Lasaco, N3.34 billion; Leadway, N3.13 billion; NICON, N18.37 billion; Niger, N1.92 billion, and Ensure (now Allianz), N2.42 billion.
Besides, the two indigenous reinsurance firms also invested a total of N18,53 billion in real estate with Continental Reinsurance putting in N2.86 billion while Nigeria Reinsurance committed N15.66 billion into the assets.
Meanwhile, the industry revealed that it posted a total of N400 billion during the 2018 financial year.
Chairman of the Nigerian Insurers Association (NIA), Mr. Tope Smart disclosed that the figure represented 10 per cent higher than N363 billion recorded in 2017.
Smart also noted that the association was working closely with the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) to promote the business of insurance and increase its contributions to national Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Some of the initiativesâ€™ according to him, include, the insurance industry rebranding project; regulation on micro insurance; collaboration on financial inclusion; bancassurance guidelines, among others, expected to impact positively on the business of insurance companies.
In a bid to encourage good relationship with the insuring public, the operators have also set up a Customer Compliant Bureau, which has effectively resolved over 40 conflicts received from policyholders and 30 between member companies.
In the same vein, the association is assiduously working to reduce complaints from policyholders to a minimal level.
Meanwhile, policyholders who suffered insured risks in the 2018 financial year were compensated by insurance companies to the tune of N160.5 billion. According to stakeholders in the industry, this was an improvement from N142.83 billion claims paid in 2017 financial year as virtually all underwriting companies recorded an increase in claims paid in their latest financial year.
The increase in claims volume, according to findings, is connected to the rise in replacement value of insured assets, as insurers have to pay through their nose to replace insured assets when risks occur, at a time the premium is too meager compared to the claims value. Moreover, increased awareness on the need for policyholders to make claims, is partly responsible for this increase.
Findings also revealed that most of the underwriters had to relinquish about 70 per cent of their income to pay these claims, thereby, leaving them with about 30 per cent gross profit.
