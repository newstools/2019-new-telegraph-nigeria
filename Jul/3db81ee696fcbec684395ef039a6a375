M anchester United have reportedly agreed terms with Leicester City on a world-record £80m deal to sign Harry Maguire.  United have been linked with a move for the England international since last summer, but they had been frustrated in their pursuit during the current transfer window due to Leicester’s hefty asking price.  However, recent reports suggested that Maguire has handed in a transfer request at the King Power Stadium and talkSPORT claims that a fee has subsequently been agreed.  The £80m price tag will see United pay an initial £60m for the 26-year-old with a further £20m in add-ons and bonuses.  Maguire will become the world’s most expensive defender should the deal go through, surpassing the £75m Liverpool paid for Virgil van Dijk in January 2018.  Manchester City had also been linked with a move for Maguire, but pulled out of the race after learning of Leicester’s demands.
