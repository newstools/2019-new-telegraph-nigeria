The Management of Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) Plc. has assured customers especially those in Edo state that the fire incident which occurred on Sunday at the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) station in Benin, Edo state has not in any way affected the supply of electricity to them. The fire incident initially caused a partial system collapse as the gutted TCN station is interconnected to other TCN locations across the country.  However, normalcy in terms of power supply was restored later in the day as spirited efforts by stakeholders at the instance of BEDC yielded positive result as the fire was eventually put off same day.  TCN, it added, has since Sunday after the incident been wheeling electricity to its feeders in all BEDC locations, stressing that customers without power supply may be due to either load management schedule or local technical fault in their locations, among other sundry reasons.  BEDC management said that no specific location was affected in terms of power supply due to the fire incident and commended customers for their understanding and cooperation over the fire incident.
