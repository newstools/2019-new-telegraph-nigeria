 Former Nigeria captain, Joseph Yobo, has described the Super Eagles’ 2-0 defeat against Madagascar as a big shock while explaining that the game was won in the midfield. The Barea of Madagascar, making their debut at this year’s Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, qualified for the round of 16 ahead of Nigeria in Group B with seven points from two victories against Burundi and Nigeria. They also secured a 2-2 draw against Guinea in their opening game. “Madagascar came to the competition without any fear and it was a remarkable achievement for them,” Yobo, who captained the Super Eagles to the AFCON title in 2013, said on SuperSport where he is working as a pundit for the competition. “The opening goal was the defining moment of the game and Madagascar took control of the game from that moment. The debutants can stand up and celebrate their win as they have been able to stand up against the established teams. “They kept Nigeria at the back feet, making them look like an average team, as soon as we conceded, the team never recovered. “Madagascar should enjoy the moment; they deserved the victory as they were far better than the Super Eagles in the game.” Meanwhile, the former defender has berated the Super Eagles for playing badly in the game and hopes they play better in the knockout stage. He was surprised with the inability of the team to create scoring chances after having just a shot on target from 10 shots. He said: “A country with so many attacking threats getting just one shot on target is not good enough. They should be making the goalkeeper work and not allowing the opponents to dictate the pace of the game. “We are already through to the knockout stages and I expect a better Super Eagles in the Round of 16, we must give it our all.”
