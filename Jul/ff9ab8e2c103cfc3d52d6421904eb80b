Anthony Ekoh Jnr, a pharmacist, has sued the House of Representatives member representing Afikpo North / Afikpo South Federal constituency and newly-appointed Deputy Chairman, House committee on Appropriation and Hon. Iduma Igariwey, for defamation of character. Ekoh Jnr, one of the opponents of the lawmaker in the last general election, is claiming the sum of N1bn as damages to his person and his company, Ekoh Drugs Limited, in a suit filed in Abakaliki High Court. Ekoh is claiming, among other things, that Igariwey defamed him by making repeated statements in both the print and social media that he was a fake pharmacist and secondary school dropout. In a 54-point statement of claims, Ekoh claims he has been traumatised and made to look ordinary and has lost face in the society through the claims of Igariwey. He averred that he went to Federal Government College, Wukari where he said he not only completed his secondary education in 1985 but was an established sportsman and house prefect.
