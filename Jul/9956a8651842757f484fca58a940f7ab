The National Leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday carpeted the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for investigating the choices of its members during the 9th Assembly principal officers’ election. The APC National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, who reacted to PDP’s planned investigation on the voting pattern of its members, said it violated the basic principle of democracy. Speaking during a meeting between the APC National Working Committee (NWC) and party stakeholders from Kano State, he used the opportunity to lay to rest the speculations on House Leader, as he announced the former Chief Whip in the 8th Assembly, Ado Doguwa, as the choice of the party for the Majority Leader of the House of Representatives. According to him, Doguwa’s name would be forwarded to the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, for formal announcement. He also commended the maturity of the National Assembly members during the election of the principal officers. Addressing the Kano State APC delegation led by the State Deputy Governor, Nasiru Gawuna, Oshiomhole said: “I was particularly excited when, in violation of a court order, the Speaker insisted that the election be conducted through secret ballot and our members in the two chambers proved their complete loyalty to the party by voting in the manner that they did. “They voted such that the PDP that was calling for secret ballot because they didn’t want people to know how they voted are now the ones conducting enquiries to find out who voted for who. That is a complete violation of the essence of secret ballot.
