The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has told the senatorial candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC) for Imo North in the last general elections, Senator Benjamin Uwajumogu that the commission would not be stampeded into issuing him a certificate of return. Uwajumogu had led a protest to the INEC headquarters on Monday demanding a certificate of return based on an order by an Abuja Federal High Court. But a statement on Tuesday by the National Commissioner in charge of Information and Voter Education, Festus Okoye, INEC said though it has been served with court judgment on July 16, it has not taken a decision.
“The said judgement could not undergo the regular processes and procedures of the commission and must wait for the next commission’s meeting. “The commission will not be stampeded into taking precipitate action or decision that may be detrimental to the electoral process and procedures,” Okoye stated. He stated that as at July 22, the commission has withdrawn and re-issued 87 certificates of return to different candidates based on court orders.
