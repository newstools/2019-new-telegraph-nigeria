A member of the Intelligence Response Team (IRT) in Aba, Abia State, has reportedly shot a police inspector while attempting to disperse protesting crowd with live bullets. The incident, according to an impeccable source, happened at the main gate, Aba Area Command, Hospital road. According to the source, the inspector identified as Sunday Ekpeni, was seriously wounded by bullets which hit him twice on his thigh and knee. The source said Ekpeni is currently hospitalized at the Police Clinic located inside the Aba Area Command where he is undergoing further examination. On what led to the incident, the source said that trouble started when some motor parts dealers at the popular School Road had a misunderstanding that almost resulted in bloodshed on with staff of Abia State Environmental Protection Agency (ASEPA). According to the source, the warring parties may have called police on the matter, which warranted police to invite them to the Area Command for settlement. “When they arrived in large numbers, the police asked that they bring in their leaders while the rest stay outside the gate to avoid any attack on the police station or its operatives. “But while the IRT operatives saw that if the crowd entered the police station, the officers will be overwhelmed and find it hard to manage them, and instead of shooting into the air to scare them, they shot on a concrete floor. “If it was a bare ground, the shooting on the ground would have spread sand on their faces and caused them to move but it was a concrete floor which caused the bullets to skid off its surface and hit a policeman.”
