The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has thrown its weight behind the Federal Government in its effort to align with the United Nations by signing the action climate change agreement. President of NLC, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, disclosed this in a letter signed addressed to the Secretary to the Government of the Federation. NLC described the agreement as a commitment to support a just ecological transition by formulating national plans for a just transition, creating decent work as well as green jobs for the citizens. According to the NLC, the process involves creating mechanisms of inclusive social dialogue such as assessing employment, social and economic impacts of ecological transition and green jobs potential; implementing skills development; designing innovative social protection policies; increasing transfer of technology and knowledge to developing countries as responsible investment. Wabba stated thatÂ  the NLC looks forward to being partners with government in the implementation of these commitments. The letter noted that the UN Secretary-General is calling on all leaders to come to New York in September with concrete, realistic plans to enhance their nationally determined contributions by 2020, in line with reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent over the next decade, and to net zero emissions by 2050.
