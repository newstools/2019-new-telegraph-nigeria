Criticism is an act of expressing disapproval of somebody’s action or opinion.  Criticism is a contaminant, infects relationship and erodes the feeling of love Criticism attacks, blames or fault finds other person’s personality and character and too often it comes from ill thoughts which usually destructive in that it accuses, intimidates and tries to make the other person feel guilty. In marriage relationships, many users of criticism claim that their remarks are only trying to change their spouse into a better person by offering ‘constructive’ criticism.  But no one can’t change another person by criticism, but you can change people by love, forbearing and giving positive encouragement.  So as to make you marriage sweet, keep criticism out and there is need for you to forgive your spouse from your heart. Fight against the act of unforgiving with all your strength. Also accept your partner the way he/she is, knowing that you in particular is not yet a perfect man. Keep meditating over the position part of your spouse and with God’s help, this will give you victory over criticism.
