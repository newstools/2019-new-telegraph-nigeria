The leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State has suspended the Edo State House of Assembly (EDHA) member-elect, Christopher Ewere Okaeben.  The suspension which was announced yesterday at an enlarged meeting of APC members in local government, was recommended by a five man panel set up on July 1 to investigate Okaeben’s misconduct. According to the Chairman of APC in the council, Godwin Alabi, who read the report of the findings to members of the party, “the party followed the provisions of Article 21 of its constitution, which stipulates disciplinary actions for erring members.”  Alabi explained that the suspension of Okaeben was as a result of his failure to honour several invitations extended to him to ascerin  tain his grievances against the party. He said: “Following his utterances, the APC in the council area asked him to apologise but he refused to comply with the party’s directive, rather he threatened the life of the chairman of the party in the council area, Alabi.”  Alabi, however, thanked the committee members for their objectivity while carrying out their assignment. On his part, the Chairman of Oredo Local Government Area, Jenkins Osunde, said: “The party has taken a decision on Chris Okaeben.”  He added that the party’s attention should now be focused on supporting Governor Godwin Obaseki to deliver the dividends of democracy to Edo people. A member of the party in Oredo Ward 7, Mr. Tony Alile, who moved the suspension motion, said Okaeben violated the party’s rules and was subsequently suspended for his action
