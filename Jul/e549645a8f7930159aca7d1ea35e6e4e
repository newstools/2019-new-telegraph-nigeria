ABSUTH workers went on strike on 27th November, 2018 following 10 months’ salary arrears owed them. According to Onwuka, the planned strike suspension followed “a tripartite agreement reached between the Abia State government, the management of Abia State University Teaching Hospital and the organized labour in the Teaching Hospital. Onwuka said: “The 7 months’ old strike embarked upon by staff of the Abia State University Teaching Hospital (ABSUTH), Aba has been suspended with immediate effect. “A communique endorsed by all the leaders of the various industrial unions in the Teaching Hospital enjoins the workers to immediately resume duties from Wednesday July 3rd, 2019.” The statement added that the unions agreed to suspend the strike to respect Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, who intervened personally in the dispute, promising to meet the workers’ demands.
