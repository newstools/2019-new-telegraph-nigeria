I t was another impressive performance by African junior champion, Enoch Adegoke, as he ran a new personal best to win the men’s 100m at the 2019 Cameroon Grand Prix.  The Obafemi Awolowo University undergraduate finished the race in 10.15 seconds as he smashed his previous record of PB of 10.19 seconds. His season’s best was 10.29 seconds.  Though he has gone faster this season after winning the MoC Grand Prix in a supposed PB of 10.12secs, this time is yet to be officially registered by the IAAF which gives doubts on its validity.  Adegoke’s brilliant performance in Cameroon confirms Nigeria now has five athletes that have gone under the 10.15secs mark, with three already hitting the IAAF World Championship standard of 10.10secs.  Also shining at the Grand Prix was Emmanuel Arowolo, who won the men’s 200m with a new PB of his own, winning the race in 20.37secs, to put to the past his previous PB of 20.84secs and qualifying for the World Championships.
