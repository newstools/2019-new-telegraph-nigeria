The Catholic Women Organisation of Nigeria (CWON) has blamed lack of moral and civil education on the incidences of assault and sexual abuse of women in the country.  At a press conference in Abuja yesterday, National President of CWON, Mrs. Cecilia Nwanneka Okolo, decried the decaying moral values, and said that the nation is heading to precipice unless something urgent is done to arrest it. Okolo stated that the organisation is establishing a special school for the boys, to instill in the malechild good morals that will make them decent members of the society.  “Of recent there has been this clamour for girl-child education, girl-child emancipation and so on, but we have found out that after all the education, our girls will end up in the society where they will meet the untrained boys, and it appears we are in for a vicious circle.  “We had a meeting of World Union of Catholic Women Assembly in September last year, we had four areas to address and one of them is looking out for and fighting for women and children who are being battered and others being sexually abused,” she disclosed.  She added that the CWON was happy at the way women rose in defence of women who were abused. On the proposed Cor Mariae Boys College, the CWON president said the school would admit the first set of students this September
