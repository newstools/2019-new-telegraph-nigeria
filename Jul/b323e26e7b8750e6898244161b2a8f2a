Muritala Ayinla  Tragedy struck early Thursday morning at Ijegun area of Lagos State as fire gutted the community leaving two persons dead, eight injured and property worth millions of Naira including 30 vehicles completely burnt. Although as at the time filing this report, the exact cause of the inferno could not be ascertained as there were conflicting accounts on what led to the explosion. While one account blamed the incident on the activities of pipeline vandals, who were engaging in bunkering activities, others said that fire emanated near the scene of the disaster. Yet another said when the vandals, who had already siphoned petrol into a 33,000-litre tanker, were intercepted by police, they (vandals) deliberately set the spilled fuel on fire in a bid to deter the security agencies from apprehending them. The emergency responders and other officials from the Lagos Fire Service, LASAMBUS, NSCDC, Neighbourhood and Safety Corps, RRS and others had hectic time controlling the situation which generated serious confusion. Speaking with New Telegraph, the head of the Fire Service, Mrs Adeseye Margret, who led the fire fighting operation, said that the state fire agency received the information at about 5am. Adeseye, who also introduced herself as the Acting Director of the agency, said that five fire trucks were deployed to the scene to battle the blaze.
