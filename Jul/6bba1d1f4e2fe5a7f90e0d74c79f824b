LYTA, a former signee of YBNL, Olamide’s record label, says the rapper deprived him of the freedom his music career needed to thrive. Speaking in an interview with Hip TV on why he parted ways with the rap star, he said the label had a music release calendar which was inconsistent with how often he intended dropping new songs. According to him, music-making is no competition and he doesn’t intend competing with his colleagues within or outside the label. “When we want to drop new songs, we do so in a group of five artsites. I was dropping my songs and they were talking about a calendar of some sort that I knew nothing about. I couldn’t always have to wait that long before dropping songs for my fans,” he said. “That was why I made the move to leave the label. Olamide treats me well. He takes me like a son and taught me lots of stuff, told me I had to hustle. While I’ve been there, I’ve been okay with the family. But for the good of my music career, I decided to move.” Following LYTA’s exit, Olamide had in a statement explained that he (LYTA) told him some persons expressed interest in signing him and that the calendar routine was only a measure to ensure even growth among upcoming artiste signed to the label.
