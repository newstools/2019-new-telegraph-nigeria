 The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sold about $7 billion to the Bureaux De Change (BDC) segment of the foreign exchange market in the first six months of 2019, findings by New Telegraph have shown. According to the CBN’s economic report for the first quarter of this year, the apex bank sold more forex to authorised dealers, including BDC operators, between January and March this year, compared with the preceding quarter. The report stated: “A total of $11.81 billion was sold by the CBN to authorised dealers in the first quarter of 2019. This represented 10.2 per cent increase above the level in the fourth quarter of 2018. The development, relative to the preceding quarter, reflected the increase in inter-bank sales and swaps transactions in the review quarter. “Of the total, foreign exchange forwards disbursed at maturity was $2.30 billion (19.5 per cent); sales to BDCs, $3.64 billion (30.8 per cent); I&E window, $1.53 billion (13.0 per cent); interbank sales, $0.55 billion (4.6 per cent); swaps transactions, $1.14 billion (9.7 per cent); SMIS intervention, $1.40 billion (11.8 per cent); wholesale forwards intervention, $1 billion (8.4 per cent); and SME intervention, $0.26 (2.2 per cent).” Similarly, data obtained from the CBN’s economic reports for April and May this year shows that it sold a total of $2.2 billion to BDCs during the period.
Specifically, the reports indicate that the CBN sold $1.16billion and $1.05 billion to the BDCs in April and May respectively. Significantly, in its economic report for the month of May, released a fortnight ago, the banking regulator stated that although interbank sales during the period fell by 10.0 per cent to $0.09 billion, compared with the level in the preceding month, BDCs’ sales, however, rose by 6.3 per cent to $1.05 billion.
While the CBN has not yet released its economic report for the month of June, New Telegraph’s investigations show that it sold $75,000 weekly to each of the country’s over 4,000 BDC operators during the period. This means that total sales to the money changers last month amounted to $1.2 billion.
Thus, in the first half of this year, the CBN likely sold a total of $7.05 billion to about 4,000 BDCs.
Analysts point out that the increase in forex sales to BDCs follows the CBN’s decision in November last year to step up dollar sales to the operators as part of measures to address rising demand for forex during that period. Indeed, as the apex bank puts it in its “Annual Activity Report” for 2018: “The direct sale of foreign exchange to BDCs continued in 2018. However, the Bank increased the volume and frequency of its weekly sales to three times per week in May and subsequently to four times per week in November. “This was to manage the demand pressure which emerged due to capital flight as the market reacted to normalization of rates by the US Federal Reserve, dwindling crude oil price levels and ensure exchange rate stability. Consequently, total sales to a BDC per week stood at $75,000.”
Prior to increasing its weekly sales to BDCs to four times per week late last year, each BDC was entitled to purchase $20,000 from the regulator on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. That means a total of $60,000 per week for each BDC. However, this amount increased to $75,000 when the CBN introduced a special forex sale of $15,000 per BDC every Thursday. Contrary to speculation in some quarters that the CBN would revert to its three times per week forex sales to BDCs after the February and March elections, it has not.
The naira has exchanged at an average of N360/$ in the BDC segment of the forex market in the last one year.
In a recent report, New Telegraph estimated that the CBN sold a total of $17.8 billion to authorised dealers in the first six months of 2019.
