 F ollowing the crisis rocking the Bauchi State House of Assembly, which produced two speakers, a coalition of women groups in the state has faulted the committee set up by the National Assembly to take over the House, saying that the National Assembly has no reason to take over the House.  The coalition, Women Coalition for Sustainable Peace and Viable Democratic Gains, which spoke through its leader, Hajiya Addaji Mohammed, during a press conference in Bauchi, said the action of the National Assembly may cause confusion in the state.   She said: “We are surprised with the action of the House of Representatives, especially when the House ignored laws of the land as it is in the 1999 Constitution. They didn’t show respect for the case in court, but threatened to compel the Bauchi State governor to violate the laws of the land by asking him to withdraw the two proclamations issued for the reopening of the Bauchi Assembly within one month or they will take over the Assembly.”  Hajiya Addaji Mohammed advised Governor Mohammed Abdullahi Abubakar not to succumb to pressure and withdraw proclamations earlier given to the House going by the constitution.
