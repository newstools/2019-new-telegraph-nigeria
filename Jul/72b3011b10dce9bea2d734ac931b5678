Former Managing Director of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Chief Timi Alaibe, said he is the most qualified aspirant to govern Bayelsa State. About 21 aspirants have obtained the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) nomination form for the November 16 Bayelsa State governorship election. Alaibe, who came to submit his nomination form at PDP secretariat yesterday said he has sufficient experience in sustainable development in the Niger Delta. “I have managed 145 local governments in the institution that I worked with, the NDDC. We did strategic plans at the NDDC at a time. “Bayelsa State is just eight local governments. So, if I was able to manage the activities of 145 local governments then you will know that this is something that we can deal with. So that is the experience I am bringing on the table,” he said. He described Bayelsa State as an economic hub for the people of Ijaw nation and Nigeria at large, adding that his experience in the public and private sectors would be needed to implement the economic prosperity of the state. Alaibe said that he had prepared a blue print for the economic development of Bayelsa State, which he stated, would soon be publicised. “There are a few attributes that give leadership strength that we will put on the table. That leadership strength of political capital we have, that connection and reputation, the strong business skills, the social capital also, social networks and the implementation capacity, are the attributes that we have to be able to go to work immediately as we are just sworn in as the governor of Bayelsa State. “We want to tell our people that we shall face creation of jobs, we have strategy for resolving conflicts and youth restiveness.
