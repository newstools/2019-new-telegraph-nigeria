Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has told residents of Akure geopolitical zone of the state that it was not yet their turn to produce governor of the state. Akeredolu, who was speaking at a reception, held in honour of immediate past senator representing Ondo Central District at the weekend said the people of Akure should wait pending when it would come to produce the governor for the state. Instead, the governor, however, said Akure should be given an opportunity to produce a Minister that would represent the state at the Federal Executive Council when President Muhammadu Buhari would inaugurate his cabinet. Akure geopolitical zone which comprised Akure South, Akure North and Ifedore Local Governments had been agitating for the position of governor since 1999. The zone had not produced any elective governor or Minister since the return of democracy in 1999 despite the fact the zone hosted the state capital just it had also not produced elected governor since the creation of the state since 1976.
