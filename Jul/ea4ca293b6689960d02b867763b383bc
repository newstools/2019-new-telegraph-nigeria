 International non-governmental organization (NGO), WaterAid Nigeria and the Coca Cola Foundation through its flagship programme, the Replenish Africa Initiative (RAIN) at the weekend flagged off the construction of five water projects in five local government areas of Enugu state at the cost of N300 million.  The project, which will provide access to sustainable clean water, sanitation and hygiene services to over 10, 000 residents in and around Nsukka, Ezeagu, Uzo-Uwani, Isiuzo and Enugu South local government areas of the state, will be managed by Global Environment and Technology Foundation (GETF), technical partners to the Coca-Cola Foundation.  The launch which took place at Umuabor and Ugwuaji communities in Nsukka and Enugu South local government areas respectively, followed weeks of strategic planning and collaboration between the lead project sponsors and other key government agencies and stakeholders such as The Small Town Water Unit, Enugu State Rural Water Suppy and Sanitation Agency and the Global Health Aware and Research Foundation (GHARF) among others.  In a joint statement, organizers reiterated their commitment to implement the “Sustainable Clean Water and Sanitation in Small Towns and Rural Areas” project in the selected communities in the state.
