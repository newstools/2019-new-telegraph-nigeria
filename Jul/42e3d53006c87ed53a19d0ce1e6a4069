Police have arrested a member of a kidnapping syndicate which has been terrorising residents of Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State.
The suspect, Aminu Haruna, of Tambari village in Rafi, was apprehended by the operatives of Puff-Adder on a tip-off while trying to escape.
The suspect and six members of his group had kidnapped a farmer at Bodiga in Ibadan, Oyo State and collected ransom of N6 million out of which N600,000 was given to him as his own share .
Sources said members of Haruna’s gang had been kidnapping people in different parts of the country in the last three years.
Haruna said his gang had informants in some states who used to tell them where to go and kidnap successfully.
He said: “We have informants in some states we operate in. any moment they alert us, we immediately swing into action to accomplish our mission and share proceeds.
“We kidnapped the Ibadan man, ransom of N6 million was paid and my own share was N600,000. I never knew that police would trace me to Niger State.”
The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mohammad Abubakar, said the suspect confessed to the crime.
Abubakar said Haruna’s house was searched and the operatives recovered N600,000.
He noted that the suspect would be arraigned after investigation.
