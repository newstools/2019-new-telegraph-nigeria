International Breweries recently hosted its distribution partners across the country to a gala night in Lagos. The event was an opportunity for the company’s distributors, trade partners and other key stakeholders within the distribution value chain to exchange ideas, as well as deepen business relationships. It also provided the company an opportunity to fete and commend the performance of the distributor partners, with those who had excelled in their performance in the recent financial year, winning delectable prizes. Delivering her remarks, Managing Director, International Breweries Plc, Mrs. Annabelle Degroot said the successes the company recorded in 2018 would not have been possible without their hard work and commitment. While commending the stellar performance, Degroot reminded the distribution partners that standing still was not an option, but going forward, adding that as a very ambitious organisation keen on meeting the needs of consumers across the country, neither the International Breweries Plc  nor its trade and distribution partners would rest on their oars.
