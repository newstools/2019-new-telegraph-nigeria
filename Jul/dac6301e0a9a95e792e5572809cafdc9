 The Super Eagles vice-captain Ahmed Musa has described their round of 16 game against Cameroon in the ongoing African Cup of Nations as another cup final.
The former Leicester City star said they were not afraid of the Indomitable Lions, insisting that the Eagles would fly above the Cameroonians.
He said the Eagles had psychological advantage over their opponents because they edged Cameroon to the 2018 FIFA World Cup ticket after beating the Lions 5-1 on aggregates.
“This is a round of 16 tie, every match is now cup final. We have to approach this match with focus and determination because there is no time for excuses again.
“We know how physical the Cameroonians can be, we played against them during the World Cup qualifiers, we beat them and we can do it again. They are the defending champions as we all know but we are not a small team despite what happened in our last match. We have put that one behind us and we are looking for to the game on Saturday,” he said.
