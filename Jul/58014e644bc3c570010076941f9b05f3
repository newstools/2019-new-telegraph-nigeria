Nigeria’s top Afro-pop singer/song-writer, Simisola ‘Simi’ Ogunleye, will be in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory City today, to formally unveil Amala 360°, Abuja’s newest A-Class Eatery. Amala 360° is located at No. 80, Aminu Kano Crescent, in the Banex Plaza area business hub of Wuse 2, Abuja. At the formal opening event of Amala 360°, tagged Eat Amala With Simi, guests are expected to be seated by 3p.m. with the main occasion kicking off by 4p.m. Proudly Nigerian, chart-bursting Simi, no doubt, will bring her magic to light up the high-octane event as guests are expected to let down their hair and eat Amala with Simi. Amala has always been a Yoruba household meal. But in recent times Amala has evolved into a national delicacy, enthusiastically sought after by people of different tribes. Amala 360° has successfully juxtaposed the traditional value with the contemporary culinary expectations and taste. What’s more – we have made Amala accessible to every level in our society.
