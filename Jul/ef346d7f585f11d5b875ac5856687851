Police yesterday paraded three notorious armed robbery suspects who have been terrorising travellers on Maikujeri-Kagara Road in Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State. The suspects, Usman Alhassan (30), Haliru Usman (27) and Sani Idi (27), all from Maikujeri village in Rafi Local Government Area were apprehended by a team of Operation Puff Adder attached to Rafi Division following a tip-off. It was learnt that the suspects had participated in several robbery activities in the area, dispossessing residents of their valuables and making life unbearable for them. A lot of people have deserted the area as a result of the activities of the hoodlums terrorising them from time to time before they were arrested by the police. One of the suspects, Alhassan, said he and his gang members had been in the business for over six years. He said: “We have been into robbery for years now, thinking that we will make enough money and quit the business. Now we are in police net, I think that is the end of our evil activities; very shameful.” The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Muhammad Abubakar, said the suspects confessed to the crime. He said: “We recovered from them, one fabricated AK47 rifle with empty magazine and 15 bundles of new wrappers.” Abubakar said the matter would be charged to court after investigation.
