Traditional rulers in Awori and Egba kingdoms are set for a showdown over planned installation of some Obas and Baales in Aworiland in Ogun State. The installation, being allegedly planned before the end of the month, may pit the Olota of Ota, Oba Adeyemi Obalanlege against the Alake and Paramount Ruler of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo and the Olowu of Owu, Oba Adegboyega Dosunmu. However, the Olota-in- Council yesterday called on the Governor Ibikunle Amosun to intervene in the matter with a view to speedily conveying a security council meeting so as to nip the impending crisis in the bud. Addressing a press conference in Abeokuta, Seriki of Ota, High Chief Olanrewaju Bashorun, said certain people opposed to peace were behind the move to illegally install monarchs in Aworiland without recourse to the Olota who was the consenting authority. Bashorun identified the affected towns to include Sango- Ota, Atan-Ota, Ijoko-Ota, Abule Lemomu, Oke Ore and Adekoyeni, among others. He, however, fingered the Alake and Olowu in the plot to install “foreigners” in Awori towns, saying his people would resist such attempt with every legitimate means. “Our people are peaceloving but impositions like these are tantamount to taking our patience beyond limit,” the chief declared. Bashorun explained that the Olota remained the prescribed traditional authority over all the land, towns and villages “with the suffix Otta.” “As peace-loving people, we call on all men and women of goodwill, traditional and religious leaders, statesmen and women, community leaders, security agencies and political leaders to stop whoever is poised to foment trouble in the name of installing non-Aworis as Obas in Aworiland,” he said.
