Super Falcons will depart the country for Cote d’Ivoire, the venue of this year’s West African Football Union Women’s Cup on May 7 just as their handler, Thomas Dennerby, has promised to win the competition this time around. Ghana won the inaugural tournament with a 1-0 victory over host Cote d’Ivoire in 2018 with Super Falcons finishing third with 1-0 victory over Mali. Dennerby said he was going to the tournament this time around to win. “The aim of any coach going into any tournament is to win. We are going into the tournament with mostly home based players and this is an opportunity for them to make the World Cup list,” he said. He said the team had learnt a good lesson from their warm up matches in China and Cyprus and that will count in the championship in Cote d’Ivoire. “Most of the players will use the opportunity to fight for shirts and they are getting better in training. “We have 40 players on our radar both foreign and local and at least eight to 10 home based will make the squad to the World Cup finals,” Dennerby explained. He disclosed that the final list for the World Cup would be made available on May 24 and the team will play two more friendlies before the Mundial in June. One of the players Gloria Ogbanna said they were going to the tournament to surpass their performance at the last championship. “We will make sure we get something better than what we got at the last time at the championship as we adapting to the pattern the coach is formulating,” she said.
