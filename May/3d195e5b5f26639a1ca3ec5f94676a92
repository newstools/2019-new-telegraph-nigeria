The Ijebu-Diocese of the Methodist Church Nigeria has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the judiciary to bring to book, those found to be engaged in electoral malpractices in order to serve as a deterrent to others who may want to tow the unholy path in future.
The diocese made the plea after its synod held last week in Oke-Tako, Ijebu-Igbo, Ogun State, where it also alluded to insinuations that the 2019 elections were fraught with irregularities and criminal loss of lives.
In a communique signed by the diocesan Bishop and secretary, Rt. Rev. Isaac ‘Bola Osunjuyigbe and Very Rev. Samuel O. Siyanbola respectively, the church said the fight against corruption and insecurity should not be done in such a manner that would be seen as shielding destroyers of the nation
“For how does one explain the Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) Adams Oshiomhole’s outburst that ‘all who defect from opposition parties to the ruling party (APC) will have their sins forgiven’. The Church frowns at this blasphemous approach at fighting corruption as this is a selective fight against corruption.
“That government functionaries’ disobedience of court orders is alarming and contrary to norms of civilized societies. The practice must stop to portray Nigeria as a civilized country. A continuation of this unfortunate practice portrays great danger to the country’s polity.
“The Church feels that Nigeria’s situation is redeemable; acknowledges the present administration’s steps in the right direction but that the efforts are not enough and should, therefore, endeavour to turn around the country’s misfortunes for good.
The Church also alleged that the eight years of the present administration in Ogun State were not beneficial to Ijebu-North Local Government Council Area, while noting that the area is lacking in pipe-borne water, stable electricity, road construction and rehabilitation.
