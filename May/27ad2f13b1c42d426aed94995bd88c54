With the 2019 national trials concluded successfully in Lagos, the leadership of the Nigeria Para-Athletics Federation has said its focus is to ensure that a good number of athletes qualify for Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games in Japan with the aim of winning laurels for the country.
President of the Federation, Amobi Chikwendu, stated this while addressing his athletes at the end of the two-day selection trials held at the main bowl of the National Stadium Surulere, Lagos, where team Nigeria athletes to the World Para-Athletics Grand Prix holding from June 24-July 1, 2019 in Tunis, Tunisia were selected. Chilkwendu commended the athletes for putting up brilliant performance which accounted for the improved standard recorded in this year’s championship which goes to show that the athletes are fully set for the continental showdown in North Africa.
Despite challenge being posed by the scarcity of funds which has been hindering the Federation from carrying out its programmes as planned, the president charged the athletes to continue to put in their best by training hard and assured them of more qualifiers ahead of the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games These include the two world championships in France and Dubai in November and the Africa Para Games holding in Morocco in January which are all Tokyo 2020 qualifiers.
“Since the federation needs funds to attend all these qualifiers, we appeal to the ministry of sports, corporate organisations and well-meaning individuals to come to our aid by contributing funds to help the Nigerian athletes achieve their dream of winning laurels for the country,” he said. “It is on record that the para-athletics have been in the forefront of winning laurels for Nigeria in international competitions just the way they did at the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games in Austrilia by accounting for two gold and one silver out of the 12 medals Nigeria won at the Games,” he said.
