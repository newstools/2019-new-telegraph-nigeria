The Election Petition Tribunal yesterday began sitting in Calabar, Cross River State, with three petitioners withdrawing their petitions from the tribunal, citing various reasons for their actions. First to withdraw his petition was Solomon Idor Esor, who contested the Senate seat for Central Senatorial district on the platform of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). He had earlier accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of excluding his party on the ballot papers. When the Tribunal sat yesterday, counsel to the SDP candidate, Joseph Oloko Esq, explained that although his client was unlawfully excluded from the elections and he petitioned the tribunal in line with constitutional provisions, “he now considers that he has some other things he will be doing outside the country, and he, therefore, requested that his petition be withdrawn.” His application to withdraw the suit, which was labeled as number EPT/ CAL/S/02/2019 was granted without any opposition by the respondents and the matter was subsequently struck out by the three-man tribunal, led by the Chairman, Justice Vincent Agbata.
