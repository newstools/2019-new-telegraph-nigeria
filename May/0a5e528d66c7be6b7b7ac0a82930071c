I grew up as a regular girl next door; nothing special at all. Growing up years weren’t all that smooth; there were ups and downs, but my Mum is one angel I will forever be grateful to God for. She did everything she could for us to excel. Tell us briefly about your career. It all began as an actress. After my first TV appearance on Wale Adenuga Productions, ‘Superstory’, I got my first modelling job with Fumman Juice and then the Face of Lux Beauty Soap came right after and others followed.  You’re also a TV presenter. Which program and Television did you work for? I was a TV presenter for a magazine program called ‘Soul Sister Show’. It aired on various TV stations such as Silverbird TV, NTA, MITV, Galaxy TV; I think AIT and many more.  When did you discover you could also act and tell us about your role in ‘Superstory’? That was in 2005, I went for an audition and it was for ‘Superstory’. Luckily, I ended up being amongst the 10 finalists out of over 500 ladies. About my role in super story, I have acted various major roles on ‘Superstory’; not just one. I was in ‘Omoye’, ‘A New Song’, ‘Everything it takes’, ‘The promise’ and so on.  You became Lux ambassador in 2007. Tell us how you landed such a coveted job? I will say it was God because when I heard about the audition, I wasn’t really prepared for it. I was still in school and all. There were about three to four series of auditions and screenings at various advertising agencies. For every phase, I was shortlisted. I remember numbers were dropped at every screening. We were all told to come without makeup on. And God did it as I ended up becoming the Face of Lux Beauty Soap.  Which of the jobs gave you the big break into limelight? Wale Adenuga’s Super Story did it. That’s the reason a lot of people still call me ‘Olaide SuperStory’. Mention some of the major works you acted in? A movie titled ‘Atehinbo’ by Moyinoluwa Olutayo. It was a movie packaged for the Lagos State Government on rape victims. I actually played two characters in the movie. It was so challenging and I loved it. MNET ‘Tinsel’ was another work I’m glad I was part of; though I wish I had the time to take up the opportunity I was offered but I was in school then, and it was even a period I was writing exams. And then Muyideen Sasiliu’s ‘Eleburu Ike’, ‘Hands of a Stranger’ by Wale Adenuga, ‘Obi Eni’ by Olaide Olabanji and many more. Mention some other things you’ve done. I love music so I do it for fun; a lot of people do not know I do movie soundtracks. Apart from Fumman Fruit Juice and Lux Beauty Soap, I modelled for United Bank for Africa, Diva Weavon, Virgin Hair Fertilizer and few others.  Mention some of the awards you’ve gotten? I have TIMA Awards 2010, Best Female Discovery, Peak Awards 2011, Best TV presenter.  You opened a fashion house, why did you go into fashion? Oh yes! I did. I’ve been into fashion years before now on a low key. I style people for various special occasions. I only just made it public. I’ve always had passion for fashion and styling. Now I feel so fulfilled owning my own fashion label. RTWO which means Ready To Wear by OLaide is my special gift for Nigerian women as well as making my contribution to the fashion Industry. Establishing RTWO has been my lifetime dream which now came to reality. My purpose on earth might not be fulfilled without doing it. My vision is to make it a known label in Nigeria and the best that will be known all over Africa and beyond.  Describe your fashion style? My fashion style is simplicity, class and comfort.  What kinds of clothes make a major part of your wardrobe? Well, dresses actually. Moving around in either a short dress or maxi dress makes me feel freer than wearing any other kind of outfit.  You got married in 2015. How’s married life and has it affected your acting career in any way? Yes I did and it’s been so good. Well, my husband chose to always pay fantastic for every movie script that comes my way, so I will say it has affected it in a good way still. Though, I miss the camera, lights and action. You’re a beautiful lady and must have had lots of suitors. What are the qualities your husband has that made you say ‘yes’ to him?  Thanks for the compliment. The first thing I noticed about him was that he is a praying man; a strong one for that matter. That was the first attraction. He socialises while I’m not a social person as such, but he prays more than I do and even encourages me to pray more. That stole my heart away. So when he pulled the James Bond over the Sea proposal, I went capital ‘YES’.  Being a face in the limelight, how are you protecting your marriage from crashing like we’re seeing recently of celebrity marriages? I will say it has been the grace of God in abundance so far. My husband and I understand each other. Whenever we have little misunderstanding, we make up like friends do. God, love and affection have been the pillars of our marriage. I will continually pray for the abundant grace as it’s the ultimate. God has been so faithful to us in all areas. He has never failed us since we got married. What does motherhood mean to you? Wow! Motherhood is a great privilege! I’m so thankful to God for giving me a child. It’s a great responsibility, the best sweet job ever worth sacrificing all my time for.   How do you relax? I listen to soothing music.
