Pensioners in their hundreds yesterday threatened to institute legal actions against the Federal Government and the 36 state governors over their failure to pay accumulated arrears of gratuities and pension in the country. The pensioners under the auspices of the Nigeria Union of Pensioners (NUP) gave the two tiers of governments two months within to pay their outstanding arrears or face legal action. The southwest Zonal Chairman of NUP, Chief Ayo Kumapayi and the spokesman of the Union, Olusegun Abatan, handed down the threat yesterday while speaking with journalists at the end of their zonal meeting held in Akure, the Ondo state capital. The NUP Spokesperson said the legal action became imperative in view of the rising cases of sick and dead pensioners unceremoniously as a result of unpaid entitlements by the state governments of Ogun, Lagos, Ekiti, Oyo, Osun, and Ondo as well as other parts of the country. Kumapayi who addressed the media alongside the Ondo state Chairman of NUP, Chief Raphael Adetuwo and other chairmen and Secretaries of the Union from the six states, blamed failure of the state governors to pay their gratuities and pension regularly on reckless spending on humongous salaries and allowances of political office holders. His words “Humongous salaries and allowances of public office holders especially senators and House Representatives members who take home about N13million and N14million monthly need to be reviewed, how can those people be collecting such huge money in a country where 80 per cent are battling to meet daily meal?” The NUP Zonal leaders also demanded the review of law setting up the Revenue Mobilisations, Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) to empower it to place all the political office holders including the President, governors, ministers, Federal and state lawmakers on the same salary scale with civil servants from Grade Level-18 to Grade Level-25 in the country.
