The Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT), has condemned the attack by some unidentified armed men on Government Girls Secondary School, Moriki, in Zamfara State, which led to the abduction of two caterers and their children. Secretary General of the union, Dr. Mike Ene, noted that the attack which was carried out on the school on Wednesday, was originally intended to abduct students. He lamented that such attacks were affecting education in the region. He said: “It is regrettable that bandits’ activities are becoming so rampant in the north east and north west such that people can never sleep with their two eyes closed. What do students have to give to kidnappers, so I think it is beyond human imagination that when armed robbers or gunmen strike, they find their way to schools instead of other places. It is something this country will rise up against and fix squarely.” Ene further lamented that the activities of Boko Haram insurgents and bandits in the region which have claimed the lives of many teachers, were creating a wide gap in education between the north and south. “In Borno State alone, we have lost over 600 teachers through this action of Boko Haram. Beyond losing them, now that Boko Haram and bandits are heading to north-west you will see that it is affecting education adversely and the blow it has dealt to education in that area is something to cry about. It is something that is so obvious that in the next three decade we cannot cover the damage,” he added. On the non-payment of teachers’ salaries, Ene said the union was worried about states such as Abia, Benue, Zamfara and Kogi that are owing teachers for so many months. While commending state governors who were making efforts to pay teachers and other staff under their payroll, the Sec Gen lamented that Zamfara State was yet to implement the old minimum wage.
