An Islamic preacher, Sheik Muyideen Ajani Bello, yesterday dissociated true Muslim members from perpetrating inhuman acts he described as callous. Bello, who spoke against the backdrop of the spate of mass killings in the country in the name of religion, while delivering preRamadan lecture at the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), Osogbo, said those killing in the name of God are not true Muslims. Speaking on the theme: ‘Religious Harmony, Panacea for Political and Economic Development in Nigeria’, the cleric said: “We cannot restore the dignity of man by killing innocent people, we should desist from anything that can make us to be seen and regarded as fanatics, we are not fanatics. “Anybody who kills people while shouting Allah is not a Muslim and not a true Muslim and will go to hell.” He argued that the religion forbids claiming of one fellow human being’s life and charged muslims faithful to always live in harmony with other religious sects, saying it is only in unison that unity could be restored in any given society. The cleric stated that Islamic religion preaches peace and advised those in the religion to shun segregation, sectionalism and discrimination which could result in acrimony and disunity in the society. In his remarks, the state Governor, Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola, described religious disharmony as a bane to social and economic development in the society. Represented by the Deputy Chief of Staff to the Governor, Alhaji Adeyanju Abdullahi Binuyo, Oyetola advocated for peace among Muslim members and appealed to them to use the holy month of Ramodan to reach out to the needy and ensure they relate with non Muslims harmoniously.
