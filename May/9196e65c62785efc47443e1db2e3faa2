Police in Anambra State said they had recovered and reunited a child identified as Mmerichukwu, who was stolen at the aged of seven in 2012, with its parents. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr. Haruna Mohammed, said in a statement yesterday that the child was stolen from the biological mother, Mrs. Jennifer Azubuike. He said: “On May 29, about 6.30a.m., following intelligence report, police detectives attached to the command’s Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) arrested Ifeyinwa Ezename (50) and Caroline Mbonu (75). “Suspects had in 2012 conspired with David Nwachukwu, now in prison custody, and stole Mmerichukwu Okoli, male, seven years old, from the biological mother, Azubuike Jennifer. “Consequently, the stolen child was recovered and reunited with his parents.” Mohammed, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), added that another eight-year-old child, identified simply as Ifeoma, was equally rescued from the suspects, who could not give satisfactory account of the child.
