     Nigeria’s Fourth Republic, which clocks 20 years on May 29, has witnessed politicians, who have been in power uninterruptedly for two decades, FELIX NWANERI, TEMITOPE OGUNBANKE and WALE ELEGBEDE report   Nigeria’s Fourth Republic became possible, following the death of then military dictator, General Sani Abacha in 1998, as his successor, General Abdusalami Abubakar initiated the transition, which heralded the country’s return to democratic rule in 1999. Abubakar, not only lifted the ban on political activities, but freed political prisoners. This led to formation and registration of three political parties – Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), All Peoples Party (APP) and Alliance for Democracy (AD)). Consequently, elections were held across the country for elective positions at the state and federal levels culminating in the April 1999 presidential poll that saw the emergence of a former military ruler, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo as president and was sworn-in on May 29, 1999.  But 20 years after, it is still unfilled dreams, leaving many to wonder if Nigeria’s Fourth Republic was not one mismanaged even as there is the belief that a majority of those, who have been at the helm of affairs in the last two decades have over stayed their welcome.
Among those who hold this conviction, is a renowned professor of political economy and former presidential candidate, Pat Utomi, who recently described politicians who spend more than 12 years in public offices as social parasites. In an interview aired on ARISE TV, the Second Republic presidential adviser said: “I despise people who live on politics. I think that people who make a career in life based on politics are doing society a disservice. “I have said that nobody should hold public office for more than 12 consecutive years. You go from a commissioner to the governor, senator; you are a social parasite. “You should come out of your hard work, make a difference for four to eight years and go back to what you do. If it’s not like that for you, you are a parasite to society. The characters making it difficult to make progress are social parasites, who call themselves politicians.” David Mark The former Senate president is among the top beneficiaries of the present political dispensation, having been within the corridors of power since 1999.  For Mark, who had earlier served as military administrator of Niger State (1984-1986) and minister of Communication, he has been in the Senate since 1999, which makes him Nigeria’s longest serving senator. He was first elected as senator for Benue South Senatorial District in 1999 and was president of the Senate from 2007 to 2015 The Benue State born politician was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Nigerian Army in 1970 upon his graduation from the Nigeria Defence Academy (NDA) and retired as a Brigadier General. Mark aspired for the presidential ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party for the 2019 general elections, but was among those defeated by former Vice President Atiku Abubakar. His record as the nation’s longest serving senator would be equaled by the time the 9th National Assembly is inaugurated in June as he did not contest the poll to return to the Red Chamber after losing the PDP presidential ticket. Ike Ekweremadu The Senate deputy president will step into the shoes of his former principal (Mark) as he won election into the apex legislative chamber for the fifth time in the recent general elections. The Enugu State born lawyer turned politician, who has the record of being the number two man in the Senate for 12 unbroken years (2007-2015), has been in the upper legislative chamber since 2003.

Ifeanyi Okowa The Delta State governor, who trained as a medical doctor and practiced his profession between 1983 and 1991, when he ventured into politics, has been within the corridors of power before the advent of the Fourth Republic. He served as Secretary of Ika Local Government Area in 1991, and upon the creation of Ika North East Local Government Area in the same year, he became its pioneer chairman, a position he held till 1993. With the truncation of the Third Republic in 1993, Okowa resumed his medical practice, but returned to politics in 1998, following the lifting of the ban on politics by the then military government. Since then, he has held several positions at the state and federal levels. They include commissioner for Agriculture and Natural Resources (1999-2001), Water Resources Development (2001-2003) and Health (2003-2006). In 1996, Okowa vied for the governorship ticket of the PDP, but lost to Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan. He, however, led the campaign of the party as Director-General and was appointed Secretary to the State Government (SSG) after the party won the poll. He resigned the position in July, 2010 to contest the senatorial election for Delta North Senatorial District, an election he won. After a term in the Senate, he was elected as the fourth executive governor of Delta State in 2015 and was re-elected during the recent 2019 polls.
