 Nigeria’s Super Falcons will earn up to a whopping $4 million about (N1.4 billion) if they go all the way at the FIFA Women’s World Cup in France in June. Coach Thomas Dennerby has pledged to take the nine-time African champions beyond the quarter-final stage of the competition. Dennerby has said that the team’s target is to play in the semi-finals of the tournament and if everything goes according to his plans the Super Falcons will smile home with $2 million for playing in the semi-finals and can earn $400,000 more if they emerge the third best team in the competition. A statement from FIFA headquarters in Switzerland says that the winners of the tournament will go home with $4 million while the runners-up will earn $2.6 million. The semi-finalists will earn $1.6m to $2m, quarter-finalists $1.45m and round of 16 teams $1m. The eight teams that drop out in the first round will pocket $750,000 each as participation fee.  The Super Falcons, who have taken part in all previous FIFA World Cups, are in Group A alongside hosts France, Korea Republic and Norway.
