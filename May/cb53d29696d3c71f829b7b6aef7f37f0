Minister of State for Aviation, Hadi Sirika, has revealed that the Federal Government has concluded plans to pull down the Murtala Muhammed International Airport to construct another one. He said the project would be handled by Julius Berger at the cost of N14b. He stated that the terminal in use which was built in 1979 has outlived its usefulness. The terminal was built to handle 300,000 at inception but the passengers it handles has grown to 8 million in the past three years. Also, the government said it will shut the Enugu International Airport for total repair of the runways which is caving in. Ethiopian Airlines which operates into the airport would be stopped because of the danger the airport pose to flight operations. The Minister said he had discussed with the Enugu state governor of the need to relocate the market located very close to the airport and the free trade zone to make for expansion of the runway and other facilities to international standard.
