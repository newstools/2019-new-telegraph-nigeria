Super Falcons will on Tuesday (today) play a tune-up match against a selected squad at their training base in Bad Tatzmannsdorf, Austra. It will be the first match for Thomas Dennerby’s lasses since the commencement of their last phase camping at Avita Resort, following the arrivals of all 23 players that have been selected in the final squad list for the 8th FIFA Women’s World Cup in France. The duo of Asisat Oshoala and Chinwendu Ihezuo were the last set of invited players to hit the camp on Sunday, but they missed nine-time African champions’ endurance run in the woods of Bad Tatzmannsdorf on Saturday, as the technical crew put the team through stamina building. In the absence of Oshoala and Ihezuo, 21 players, led by new captain, Desire Oparanozie, ex-skipper, Onome Ebi and ace defender, Osinachi Ohale, took part in the drills. The team then commenced normal training sessions on Monday and a training match was fixed for Tuesday against an All-Star team at the Falcons’ Avita Resort camp. The Falcons will depart from Austria on Tuesday June 4 for Paris, before proceeding to Reims, the city where they play their first match of this year’s Female Mundial against Norway on Saturday June 8. Nigeria will then tackle Korea Republic in Grenoble on June 12 before concluding the group phase ties against France in Rennes on June 17. Meanwhile, Nigeria’s Ambassador to Austria and Slovakia, Vivian Okeke, on Sunday paid a visit to the Avita Resort camp of the Falcons. Speaking to the players, Okeke said the embassy received a letter from the Nigeria Football Federation on the arrival of the team and Her Excellency and Mission staff had come to ensure players and officials were happy and well-cateredfor.
