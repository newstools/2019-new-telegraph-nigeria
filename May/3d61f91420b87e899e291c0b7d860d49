Paul Pogba will force through his exit from Manchester United in the summer with Real Madrid atop of his preferred destinations, according to reports by ESPN. The France World Cup winner, who cost the Red Devils a club-record fee of £90 million in 2016, has reportedly made up his mind and will push the club to sell him even if they wish to keep their star midfielder. Pogba has enjoyed rejuvenated form under new manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but it is believed the club’s failure to qualify for the Champions League, criticism from the media and fans combined with the interest of Zinedine Zidane’s Real Madrid has convinced the 26-year-old his future lies elsewhere.  He said in an interview in March that it was his “dream” to play for the Spanish giants in the future, and ESPN say he has instructed agent Mino Raiola to ensure he gets his move. Manchester United have repeatedly and defiantly stated Pogba is not for sale, but the outlet says a bid of €160 million may convince them to part ways with their former youth player. Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich are the other clubs with reported interest in Pogba and the finances to fund such a move. The money would free up Solskjaer to rebuild a squad that has struggled to sixth-place in the Premier League.
