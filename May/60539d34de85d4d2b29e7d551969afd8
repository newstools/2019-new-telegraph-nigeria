Super Eagles forward Samuel Chukwueze has said any of the big clubs chasing his signature must give him a firm assurance that he will get playing time before he signs for such outfit. The Villarreal winger has been one of the hottest properties in Europe following stellar performance for the Yellow Submarines in the just-concluded season. He has been linked with top clubs in Europe including Liverpool, Barcelona, Atletico and Bayern Munich. He was delighted to get look-in from such big sides but he insisted that he would join a side that can guarantee his steady growth. However, he promised not to allow the transfer talks affect his focus for the 2019 African Cup of Nations and he is determined to help the Super Eagles do well in Egypt. “I am aware of top clubs such as Barcelona, Liverpool, Bayern Munich, and host of others looking for me; but I am still a Villarreal player because nothing concrete has been done. It’s quite emotional for me that these big sides came calling because that shows that hard work pays. “I am not going to relent; I will always give my best on the field of play to ensure I remain relevant. I don’t want to rush to join any club but if I must leave, it must be the right club that is ready to give me playing time. However, all my focus is now on how to help the Super Eagles team at the Nations Cup,”
