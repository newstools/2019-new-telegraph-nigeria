 Nigeria’s foremost female wrestler, Odunayo Adekuoroye, has taken a swipe at Ondo State governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, over what she called the total devotion to football only.  Adekuoroye, a two time Commonwealth Games gold medalist, hails from Ondo State, but she has rescinded her loyalty and representation, due to alleged preference by Governor Akeredolu for Sunshine Stars FC of Akure.  Consequently, Adekuoroye says she will no longer represent Ondo State, starting with the 3rd Governor Dickson Wrestling Championship in Yenegoa, Bayelsa State next month. While affirming that she will now line out under the banner of her church, Mountain of Fire & Miracles Ministries (MFM) Wrestling Club, the world famous female grappler insisted that Akeredolu’s government had not in any way appreciated other sports events.  “I have made up my mind not to represent Ondo State at the 3rd Governor Dickson Wrestling Championships next month. I am representing Mountain of Fire & Miracles Ministries, because they have been more supportive to my career,” Pantera dancer ,as she is nicknamed, said.  The four-time African champion and world silver medalist added that lack of equipment and facilities were other issues causing Ondo State to lag behind in Nigeria’s sporting sector, but interjected that the athletes were always determined to do well, despite lack of motivation.  The 25-year-old added: “The Ondo State government has not fulfilled her promises made to the wrestlers in the past. “When we returned from the 2018 Commonwealth Games, a promise was made to host victorious athletes but nobody has seen the governor,” she said  “The governor is only concentrating on Sunshine Stars, which is not good for the development of sports.”
