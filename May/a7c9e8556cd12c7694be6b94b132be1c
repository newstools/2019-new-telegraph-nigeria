The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described as ridiculous, President Muhammadu Buhari’s failure to address Nigerians after his inauguration for a second term in office. The party said the president and his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), was overburdened by the guilt of the rigged presidential election. PDP in a statement by the National Publicity, Kola Ologbondiyan, also accused President Buhari of insensitivity, noting that such ceremony usually affords truly elected leaders, the opportunity to make commitments to their people. “It is indeed pathetic that …President Buhari did not showcase his plans or commitment to the development of critical sectors of our polity. “It also speaks volumes that President Buhari had nothing to say to the victims of mindless killings and acts of violence in various parts of our country,” PDP stated. The party equally attributed this to the fact that the president had no directions toward stemming the economic distress under his administration, for which Nigerians are now resorting to suicide and slavery mission abroad as options. “In failing to address Nigerians, President Buhari turned the inauguration to a parody,” PDP said, adding that the failure “reinforces the truism that a product of flawed electoral process cannot serve the people or meet their aspirations under a constitutional democracy. “The poor attendance and passivity of the audience at the ceremony at a time that Nigerians were trooping, in their millions, to the inauguration of state governors elected on the platform of the PDP, manifestly show.” It urged Nigerians to take solace in the party’s determination to retrieve its presidential mandate at the tribunal so as to entrench a leadership that could lead the nation out of her present predicament.
