There was pandemonium in the early hours of yesterday around the Lagos Port environment when some truck drivers clashed with Nigerian Navy officials over allegation of incessant extortion and oppression. It was gathered that a combined team of OP MESA were drafted to Lagos Port Complex, Apapa, the venue of the incident to bring the situation under control. It was alleged that one person was shot during the fracas by the officials of Nigerian Navy. Eyewitness said trouble started when some drivers were agitating that the service of the Nigerian Navy personnel in the port area was no longer needed. The chairman of the dry cargo section of the National Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO), Alhaji Innua Mohammed, said that his members were being subjected to inhuman treatment, ranging from extortion and corporal punishment, which had become unbearable. He noted that some of their trucks had been damaged by the navy personnel. However, Mohammed said the association had appeal to their members to remain calm in order to enable them find solution to the problem.
