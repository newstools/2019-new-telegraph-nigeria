Police have arrested three brothers for allegedly kidnapping and dismembering a 35-year-old man, Shehu Yakubu Garba, in Borgu Local Government Area of Niger State.
The police said the criminal conspiracy and culpable homicide took place on April 21, 2019 about 6.30p.m. Two of the brothers, Saminu Usman (25) and Yusuf Usman (22), reportedly took the victim, Shehu, to a nearby bush where they killed him in cold blood and removed his hand.
One of the suspects, Saminu, said “our elder brother, Mohammadu Usman (35), told us to bring fresh human hand for ritual purpose to enable us to get quick money”. The father of the victim, Alhaji Yakubu Garba, of Wukalami village in Borgu Local Government Area reported the matter at the New Bussa Division on April 19, 2019.
He said: “About 6p.m. on Friday, two hoodlums went to my house on a Bajaj motorcycle and whisked my son, Shehu Yakubu Garba, away to an unknown destination.” On receipt of the complaint, a team of policemen from New Bussa Division swung into action and arrested two suspects at Janruwa village in Borgu Local Government Area in connection with the case.
Also, the detectives trailed and arrested their elder brother, said to be the prime suspect.
