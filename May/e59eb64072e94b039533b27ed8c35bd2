Globacom Chairman, Dr. Mike Adenuga Jr, has called for the inclusion of noble values of honesty, hard work, integrity, probity and good character enshrined in the “Omoluabi paradigm” for the entrenchment of good governance in the country.  “Omoluabi” is a cultural concept of the Yoruba people that is used to describe a person of diligence and integrity. He made the appeal during his goodwill message read on his behalf at the 3rd Annual Oba Adetona Professorial Chair Lecture of the Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago Iwoye.  The lecture was held in Ijebu Ode on Friday to commemorate the 85th birthday of the Paramount Ruler of Ijebu land, Oba Sikiru Kayode Adetona. He said that the theme of the Lecture “Grassroots Gov- ernance, the soft underbelly of Nigeria’s political architecture”, was apt, positing that “If we get it right at the local government level, we will get it right at the top as all politics is local”. He commended Oba Adetona for donating the Professorial Chair at the Olabisi Onabanjo University, a gesture, he said, he had been generating seminal ideas for the enthronement of good governance in the country.  He prayed for more successes during the reign of the monarch who marked his 59 years as King.
