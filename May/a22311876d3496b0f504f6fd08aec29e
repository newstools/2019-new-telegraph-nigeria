Former Super Eagles goalkeeper, Peter Rufai is of the belief that the Africa Cup of Nations title will return to Nigeria for a fourth time if the entire technical crew and team are prepared to work and sacrifice for one another at the 2019 tournament which kicks off in Egypt on the June 21.
With the majority of Nigerians expecting the Super Eagles to return with the trophy, 55-year-old Rufai who was in goal for Nigeria in their triumphant run to a second continental title at Tunisia ’94 prescribes industry and sacrifice as integral to Nigeria’s dreams of emerging champions in Egypt.
“Success doesn’t come overnight: It comes with hard work,” the ex-Stationery Stores goalie who was capped 65 times at international level said.
“So, the technical crew should work harder, the team should strive. If they would work hard as a team; dedicated, disciplined and put this country first definitely, they will bring the cup back home,” he said.
Three-time champions Nigeria, despite failing to qualify for the past two AFCON editions in 2015 and 2017 are viewed as one of the favourites for the 32nd AFCON in Egypt mainly due to the ease with which they qualified and what many feel to be an easy draw in the group stage where they have been paired with Guinea, Madagascar and Burundi in Group B.
