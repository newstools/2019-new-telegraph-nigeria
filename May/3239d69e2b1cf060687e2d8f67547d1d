‘Nollywood Portraits: A Radical Beauty’, an exhibition by Nigerian-born, New York based photographer, Iké Udé, opens on Saturday June 1, at Alliance Française, Osborne Road, Ikoyi, Lagos. It is Ude’s first photography exhibition in Nigeria.  In this the solo exhibition, Udé will be offering a substantial presentation of his portraits of members of Nigeria’s vibrant movie industry, Nollywood. He will orchestrate a dramatic cinematic atmosphere of light and colour, whereby the industry’s illustrious veterans, in company with the next generation of emerging talent pose in classically staged shots. Pictorial representation will include personalities such as actress Genevieve Nnaji, director Stephanie Okereke Linus and filmmaker Kunle Afolayan. In all, 64 Nollywood personalities captured in the elegant style of the artist will feature in the exhibition, which will run till Sunday June 16.  With these works of portraiture, Udé complements the discourse on the representation of Africans in cinema, from colonial domination and inferior stereotypes to one of intellect and creative agency in telling our own stories.
Udé is an aesthete, dandy, writer and founder of the seminal artfashion print magazine aRUDE, 1995-2009.
