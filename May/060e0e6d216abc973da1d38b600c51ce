This year, she is 16, we are gathering here to mark her day and send a message to her that despite the fact that she has been left in captivity because she refused to renounce her faith, we are proud of her and standing with her. “As Christians, we are not to renounce our faith and she was bold enough. We call on the federal government to please fulfil the promises they made to the parents and to all Nigerians that Leah would be released. This is her 16th birthday and she is still in captivity, schools have come out to show solidarity and tell everyone that our schools must be kept safe, Leah is in captivity not for any crime, she has to be freed. We are encouraging her that we are trusting that the government would do the needful and bring her home. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/23ffb3ed-b6d7-4ddc-8089-43ebd94168be.jpg?resize=740%2C555&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="740" height="555" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-210969" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/23ffb3ed-b6d7-4ddc-8089-43ebd94168be.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/23ffb3ed-b6d7-4ddc-8089-43ebd94168be.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/23ffb3ed-b6d7-4ddc-8089-43ebd94168be.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/23ffb3ed-b6d7-4ddc-8089-43ebd94168be.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" data-recalc-dims="1"> “When Leah was one year in captivity, the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed came out and told the whole world that Leah was alive because there was so much rumour that she had been killed. Because they are the government, we want to believe that whatever they tell us about Leah is true. We are asking that Leah should be brought home, her mother is in Dapchi, she is seeing other girls who were rescued but her own child is still being held, how do we think she is feeling?” Also, Dr. Ekaette Ettang of Unique Schools appealed for Leah’s release adding, “Today is both a joyous and a sad day; we are excited that a girl child had the courage to hold onto her faith in spite of the dangers. We are talking to Leah saying you have made us very proud, we are excited that you as a girl, a woman in the making have been so courageous, you did not care about the danger but you held on. It is sad because you are not a criminal, you are not a prostitute, there is nothing you did that you deserved to be locked up and I don’t know what it is the cost of your soul that Nigeria could not pay for. “They paid for terrorists and many others; we are praying for you that the God of Heaven will be with you. The children here are aligning with you, saying that you have shown us what it takes to hold on to our faith, we are proud of you. To her parents, we say thank you for raising a child like Leah, it is a challenge for every parent. We stand with you and your tears shall not be in vain.” Meanwhile, Christians from Various denominations across Plateau State and Nigeria led by the ECWA President Rev.Dr Stephen Panya Baba held prayers at the ECWA Headquarters Church for the release of Leah Sharibu and also to pray for her 16th Birthday. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/70d23bbf-8541-431b-b375-3c90ee239e9b.jpg?resize=740%2C987&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="740" height="987" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-210970" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/70d23bbf-8541-431b-b375-3c90ee239e9b.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/70d23bbf-8541-431b-b375-3c90ee239e9b.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/70d23bbf-8541-431b-b375-3c90ee239e9b.jpg?w=810&amp;ssl=1 810w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" data-recalc-dims="1"> <img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/84d35a9f-23f5-4aca-95e3-e9e0a16c3061-1024x768.jpg?resize=740%2C555&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="740" height="555" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-210971" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/84d35a9f-23f5-4aca-95e3-e9e0a16c3061.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/84d35a9f-23f5-4aca-95e3-e9e0a16c3061.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/84d35a9f-23f5-4aca-95e3-e9e0a16c3061.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/84d35a9f-23f5-4aca-95e3-e9e0a16c3061.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" data-recalc-dims="1">
