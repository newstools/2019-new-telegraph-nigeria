 Super Falcons coach Thomas Dennerby has said the team’s immediate ambition is to get to at least the second round of the 2019 FIFA Women World Cup slated to begin next week in France.
The Super Falcons have played at every World Cup since the inaugural event in 1991 but got beyond the first round just once, reaching the quarter-finals in 1999 when it was still a 16-team tournament.
Dennerby said they retain the confidence to get of the Group B of this year’s tournament which has France, North Korea and Norway.
“Our ambition is to get to the last 16 at least,” Dennerby told Reuters by telephone on Wednesday as the team prepares for next week’s kick-off in France.
“These days, it’s much harder to go to the quarter-finals because the teams are so much stronger, so it’s going to need a really strong performance,” added the 59-year-old Swede, who took his home country to third place in 2011.
“I hope that we can do that and get through to the round of 16, then win one more game.
“The team have the capacity to do that. We have really worked hard to be the best Nigerian team ever to go to the World Cup.”
Meanwhile, the team will travel from their Avita Resort camp in Bad Tatzmannsdorf to Slovakia on Sunday for a friendly against their Slovakian counterparts – the second time both teams would be meeting this year.
On 1st March 2019 at the Cyprus Women’s Cup in March, the nine –time African champions edged a seven –goal thriller against the Slovakians, with goals from midfielder Rita Chikwelu (a brace), defender Osinachi Ohale and forward Anam Imo.
Sunday’s game comes up five days after the Falcons travelled to Hungary to defeat Hungarian top division team Haladas Viktoria 5-1 in their first friendly since arriving at the Avita Resort for a two –week residential camping ahead of the 8th FIFA Women’s World Cup finals in France, starting next week Friday.
