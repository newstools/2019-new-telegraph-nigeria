A group, Gan Allah Fulani Development Association of Nigeria (GAFDAN), has warned the Federal Government against advancing the sum of N100 billion to Miyetti- Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) for any form of compensation or to halt purported criminality among herdsmen. National Chairman of the group, Alhaji Sale Bayari, disclosed this at the weekend while speaking with journalists in Jos, Plateau State.  He said if the report and speculation about the Federal Government advancing N100 billion to Miyetti Allah was true, then there were better ways to empower herdsmen than dealing with a particular group that had become political, which it said would not help the situation.  Bayari said if the report was true, it would set a dangerous precedent, because any association that wanted to be relevant would now arm bandits to qualify for government patronage.  â€œI have been hearing that the Federal Government is dealing with Miyetti- Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN). The report said that the government wants to compensate herdsmen who have lost their means of livelihood, which are cattle.  The meeting took place in Birnin Kebbi and I understood that the Director- General, State Security Service (SSS), the Director- General, National Intelligent Agency (NIA), the Inspector-General of Police, Governor of Kebbi State and the Minister of Interior, were all there.
