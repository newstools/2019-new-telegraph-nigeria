…seeks custody of 10-year-old son  The wife of former Governor Sullivan Chime of Enugu State, Clara, yesterday told an Abuja High Court sitting in Apo that she was depressed during her marriage because her husband only had marital relations with her only on their wedding night. Clara stated that as sitting governor, Chime never touched her. Hence, it led to her depressed condition. She, however, denied any allegation of schizophrenia, but said she only saw the Chief Medical Director (CMD) of neural psychiatric because her husband brought him home. She has also asked the court to grant her custody of their 10-year-old son. All of these were contained in Clara’s response to the petition filed by her husband seeking the dissolution of their 11-year-old marriage. She equally prayed the court to order the release of their son to her and a child maintenance fee of N500,000 monthly. The ex-First Lady further submitted that she was ready for the divorce. She premised her request for the custody of their son on the ground that he (the boy) was not properly cared for and she is only allowed to see him five hours a month under heavy security. When asked under cross-examination if she had taken a picture to present as evidence, she informed the court she was forbidden by her husband’s stewards and security personnel from taking pictures of him. While responding to Mr. Paul Onya, counsel to the petitioner, she informed the court that in the two previous petitions she filed, she had demanded for custody of her child. Onya then requested to tender the petitions filed at Enugu High Court and a FCT High Court as exhibits before the court. Counsel to Clara, Mr. Achibongu Iyeme, objected that the documents were not certified. Trial judge, Justice Angela Otaluka later adjourned the case till June 10 for continuation of hearing.
