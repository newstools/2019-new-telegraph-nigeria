Body of a 26-year-old Chartered Accountant, Miss Lateefat Adewura Belo, who was declared missing 11 days ago, has been found floating in a canal in Gowon Estate, Egbeda, Lagos State. Lateefat was said to have gone missing on May 15 while returning from her office at Ikeja and heading home to Gowon Estate, Egbeda. It was learnt that the lady was found dead, in a canal at Gowon area of Lagos State.  The disappearance of Lateefat and eventual discovery in a canal has been described as mystifying. According to family members, while Lateefat’s body was found floating in a canal at Gowon Estate, her phone was tracked and found at Badagry area of the state.  On May 15, Lateefat left the office about 6p.m., in a colleague’s car. The colleague was said to have dropped her off at Medical Road, opposite Ikeja bus terminal, where she would board a bus. The victim’s mother, Mrs. Belo, who spoke with our correspondent on the phone last week, said that Lateefat’s sister was the last person who spoke with the victim on that fateful day. The girl spoke with Lateefat about 7p.m. The next time the family tried to call her, the phone had been switched off.  The woman, who cried throughout the interview, said: “When her sister called her, she said she was on her way home. That was the last time we heard from her.” The woman said that the matter was reported at the Gowon Police Station. Lateefat’s mother urged friends, family members, and general public to assist her in the frantic search for her daughter.
