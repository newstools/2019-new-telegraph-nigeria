Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, yesterday expressed deep feelings over pitiable condition civil servants in the state were passing through following non-payment of their entitlements; and vowed to take steps to correct the mistake.  He said life had not been easy with the workers due to the accumulated unpaid salaries; a development he said had made it extremely cumbersome for them to either afford three square meals per day and mediation to improve their health systems. Governor Ortom disclosed this while addressing workers to mark this year’s Workers Day celebration in Makurdi.  The governor, who was represented by his Deputy, Benson Abounu, regretted that despite the non-payment of their salaries, the workers decided to vote for him for a second term and vowed not to toy with their welfare and well-being and that of the people.  “We cannot afford to toy with your welfare and wellbeing and that of all Benue people. But as we appreciate your understanding and patience, please be reminded that we have not rested on our oars in seeking for lasting solutions to all the issues and problems affecting you. “We will not take the support of workers to my administration for granted.  Things have not been easy with you, things have been rough with workers and despite the hardship, you decided against all odds to return this administration for the second term, believing that we are determined to defend the Benue Valley. “I am assuring you that we will do everything humanly possible to correct our mistakes and ensure that the welfare of workers is given top priority.”
