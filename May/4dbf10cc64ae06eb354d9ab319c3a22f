The Presidential Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja has refused to issue an interim injunction to stop the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria, CJN, Justice Tanko Muhammad, from swearingin President Muhammadu Buhari on May 29, pending the determination of a petition filed by Hope Democratic Party. The tribunal, in a ruling delivered late on Wednesday night, by Justice Joseph Ikyegh, held that the motion that sought to abort President Buhari’s inauguration lacked merit. HDP and its Presidential candidate in February 23 election, Chief Ambrose Owuru, in their petition marked CA/ PEPC/001/2019, urged the tribunal to nullify the outcome of the election and order a fresh poll. Though the tribunal had yet to commence full hearing on the petition, the party filed an ex-parte motion for an order to stop President Buhari from being sworn-in for a second term on May 29. Specifically, the party and its candidate, in the motion asked the tribunal to stop the Acting CJN from administering any oath on President Buhari at the expiration of his current term, pending the determination of the petition. The petitioners further applied for an order of the tribunal to restrain President Buhari from presenting himself to be sworn-in, until “the question as to whether he has been validly elected”, is determined. The motion was predicated on section 1(2), 6(6), 139, 239 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, as well as on sections 26(4) (5), 138(1) (b) of the Electoral Act, 2010, as amended. Cited as 1st to 3rd Respondents in the matter were President Buhari, the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, and the All Progressives Congress, APC.
