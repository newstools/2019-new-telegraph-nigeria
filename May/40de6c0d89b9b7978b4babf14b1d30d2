A housewife, Amina Abubakar, on Wednesday dragged her ex-husband, Kabir Matazu,  before a Sharia Court ll sitting at Magajin Gari, Kaduna State, seeking divorce confirmation. Abubakar, told the court that Matazu, 60, a retired civil servant, divorced her in April but refused to give her any document to confirm the divorce. ”I have witnesses who can testify that he divorced me”, Abubakar said. She also told the court that he gives her N20,000 for the upkeep of two of their children which was not enough to cater for them. “Our first child is two, while the last one is just seven months’ old, I am still breastfeeding him. ”N20, 000 won’t be enough for me in one  month to eat nutritious food and breastfeed his child. He should be giving me N30, 000,” Abubakar said. Matazu, who resides in in Badarawa, Kaduna, denied that he divorced his wife. He told the court that Abubakar’s mother forced him to divorce his wife. ” I only pronounced divorce once on a paper,  signed it and gave her in presence of her parents”. The judge, Malam Musa Sa’ad-Goma, after listening to both parties adjourned the case to May 21, for further hearing. The judge also ordered the complainant to come along with her witnesses to attest to her claims of  being completely divorced by her ex-husband. (NAN)
