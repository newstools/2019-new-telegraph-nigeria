48-year-old Ademola Oresanya, on Thursday appeared in court, for allegedly defrauding Mrs Iyabo Adedire, of N931, 000, under the guise of getting her a Certificate of Ownership (C of O). Oresanya, whose address was not provided, is facing a two-count charge of obtaining by false pretence and stealing before an Ogudu Magistrates’ Court. He, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The prosecutor, Insp. Lucky Ihiehie, told the court that the defendant committed the offences in December 2018, in Ketu, Lagos. Ihiehie said that the defendant introduced himself as a land agent and collected N931, 000 from Adedire, claiming he would assist her to obtain the C of O of a land she recently acquired. He said the defendant also stole 20 bags of rice valued at N280, 000 and a cash sum of N336, 000 from the complainant. “The defendant was nowhere to be found after collecting the items and the money; and all efforts to locate him failed until he was sighted by the complainant in Iyana Ipaja, “She raised alarm and the defendant was arrested,” he said. According to the prosecutor, the offences contravene sections 287 and 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The Magistrate, Mrs Bukola Mogaji, granted the defendant bail of N500, 000 with two sureties in like sum. Mogaji ordered that the sureties must be employees of reputable organisations, and should show three years evidence of tax payment to Lagos State Government. She added that the sureties must have landed property in Lagos State and one of them must be a blood relative of the defendant. The case was adjourned until May 27. (NAN)
