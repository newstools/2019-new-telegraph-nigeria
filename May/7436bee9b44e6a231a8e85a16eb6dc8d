New Zealand-based Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) interim middleweight champion, Israel Adesanya, yesterday formally presented his gold belt to Ogun State Governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun. Adesanya, who hails from Odogbolu area of the state, recently defeated America’s Kelvin Gastelum during a UFC 236 fight in Atlanta, United States of America (USA). The martial artist, who won the bout via unanimous decision, paid a courtesy visit to the governor at his office in Oke- Mosan, Abeokuta. He arrived in the country on Wednesday to connect with his root 16 years after taking his martial arts skills to New Zealand. He moved to New Zealand when he was 13. Adesanya said he was happy to be back home and identify with his roots while extending appreciation to the governor for receiving him warmly. In his remarks, Amosun described Adesanya’s victory as a glory to Ogun State and Nigeria at large. The governor, who attributed the feat to hard work and diligence, promised to mention his success story to President Muhammadu Buhari. He thanked Adesanya for remembering his fatherland while urging him to continue to identify with his roots. In February, Adesanya defeated Brazil’s Anderson Silva at UFC 234 contest in Melbourne, Australia. Adesanya trained in taekwondo briefly during his primary school days in Opebi, Lagos State before he relocated to New Zealand.
