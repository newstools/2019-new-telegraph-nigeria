For many weeks now, teen actress, Regina Daniels has been a major topic of discussion on social media following her alleged marriage to 59-year-old politician and billionaire, Ned Nwoko. It became even more noticeable when the apparent Nigeria’s sweetheart started displaying her luxury lifestyle on social media; flying private jets and what not. Many internet users wanted to know the source of her funds and when it was revealed that she was settling as 5th wife to Nwoko, many criticised. Even some celebrities have weighed in on the matter. Some have supported Daniels and her choice of husband, while some completely condemned it, saying that money which seems to be the driver of the marriage is not the answer to everything. However, actress Victoria Inyama has shared another angle which many find interesting. In response to a post made by Daddy Freeze in which he stated that people should mind their business and leave Regina alone, Inyama said that Daniels is the originator of her misery. In the post, Victoria stated that Daniels brought the trolling on herself when she started flaunting wealth and present given to her by her husband. Inyama also stated that Regina is not the first to marry an older billionaire and those who did it before her were wise not to show off and that prevented people from poke-nosing. For Regina, as it is, she invited the trolls when she started flaunting private jet lifestyle and exotic cars on the gram. Meanwhile, Nigerian social media fans were once captivated by the love between Nollywood actors Regina Daniels and Somadina Adinma. The duo was known to tease fans with loving displays as they reaffirmed their affection for each other at any given opportunity. Some people on social media have expressed joy at Regina Daniels’ new relationship while others seem to use it as an opportunity to troll her exboyfriend, Somadina Adinma.
