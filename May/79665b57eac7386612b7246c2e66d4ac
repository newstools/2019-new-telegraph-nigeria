The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) imported two billion litres of petrol in the first 31 days of 2019. Adeola Yusuf who examines the Corporation’s Monthly Financial and Operations Report (MFOR) for the period, reports that all is not well with the downstream oil sector   For the umpteenth time, the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation talks so well in its latest monthly financial report about its upstream subsidiary, the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC).
Through the operations of NPDC and others in the upstream sector, the Corporation said that it raked in $381.7 million in January, 2019.
The smoking gun in the report, however, is less emphasis NNPC gave to its performance in the downstream sector during the month. Downstream goes south
Upon further probing, the downstream, it was discovered, performed abysmally as usual.
One of these poor performances is the importation of two billion litres approximately of premium motor spirit (PMS) into the country that prides itself the biggest crude oil exporter in Africa.
Specifically, the NNPC’s report stated: “In the downstream operation 1,998.61 million litres of petrol was supplied into the country through the Direct-Sale-Direct-Purchase (DSDP) crude-for-product arrangement in January 2019.”
To further downplay the huge but embarassing figure, the Corporation said that the “number is slightly higher than the 1,789.20million (1.8 million approximately) litres of petrol supplied in the month of December 2018.”
The 42nd edition of the NNPC report also showed that the Corporations downstream sector recorded 230 hacked pipeline points, leaving only two ruptured, marking an 11 per cent improvement from the 264 vandalized points posted in December 2018. What NNPC wants the world to see
The corporation (NNPC) headlined a statement to accompany the report, saying it raked in $381.7 million in 31 days of January and also remitted N153.01 billion into the Federation Account for the month.
For the sales and remittance of crude oil and gas proceeds, a total export receipts of $381.70 million was, according to the report, recorded by NNPC in the month as against $345.68 million posted in December 2018.
A breakdown of the numbers indicated that contributions from crude oil amounted to $269.43 million, while Gas and miscellaneous receipts stood at $111.75 and $0.52 million respectively.
The corporation also recorded a trade surplus of N15.04billion for January 2019, an increase of 24 per cent over the N12.13 billion surplus posted by the corporation in December 2019.
In a statement issued by NNPC Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Mr. Ndu Ughamadu, to summarise the report, the corporation attributed what it called “the positive financial position” to the improved performance of NNPC’s upstream subsidiary, NPDC, which recorded surplus numbers despite reduced operational activities in the month. The NPDC angle
The report submitted that NPDC’s sustained revenue drive, evident from recent average weekly production of 332,000 barrels of Crude Oil per day, had made achieving 500,000bpd production by 2020 plausible.
But the NPDC’s position contrasts with the high expenditure levels posted by two other entities of NNPC, the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC) and Duke Oil, although both ended the month with profit.
Within the period under focus, NNPC transferred N153.01 billion into the Federation Account, while cumulatively, from January 2018 to January 2019, Federation and JV received N905.45 billion and N658.66 billion respectively, under the column of Naira Payments to the Federation Accounts. The bad story
“In the downstream operations, 1,998.61 million litres of petrol was supplied into the country through the Direct-Sale-Direct-Purchase (DSDP) crude-for-product arrangement in January 2019.
“The number is slightly higher than the 1,789.20 million litres of petrol supplied in December 2018,” the Corporation said.
With 230 hacked pipeline points, NNPC still claimed victory. This huge pipeline break figures, Ughamadu said, is “an 11 per cent improvement from the 264 vandalized points posted in December 2018.”
A breakdown indicated that Mosimi-Ibadan, Ibadan-Ilorin and Aba-Enugu pipelines accounted for 67, 62 and 30 points respectively, which translated to 29 per cent, 27 per cent and 13 per cent of the vandalized points, respectively.
The Warri-River Niger axis accounted for 10 per cent and other locations accounted for the remaining 21 per cent of the pipeline breaks. Talking about gas
In the Gas Sector, natural gas production increased by 2.22 per cent at 245.83 billion cubic feet compared to output in December 2018, translating to an average production of 8,194.34 million standard cubic feet of gas per day (mmscfd).
Out of the volume supplied last January, a total of 151.50bcf of gas was commercialized, consisting of 38.03BCF and 113.47 BCF for the domestic and export market respectively.
The figure translates to a total supply of 1,226.83 mmscfd of Gas to the domestic market and 3,780.24 mmscfd of gas supplied to the export market for the month.
This implies that that 61.73 per cent of the average daily Gas produced was commercialized, while the balance of 38.27 per cent was re-injected, used as upstream fuel gas or flared.
Gas flare rate was 7.52 per cent for the month under review, translating to 610.07mmscfd compared with average gas flare rate of 9.76 per cent, that is 770.31 mmscfd for the period January 2018 to January 2019. Refineries are comatose
The refineries in Nigeria are another sad news from the downstream sector.
None of NNPC’s four refineries worked up to 50 per cent of their installed capacity at any time in 2017, official figures from the state oil firm, NNPC show.
The Corporation has four major refineries –two in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, which combine to form the Port Harcourt Refining Company (PHRC) with a combined installed capacity of 210,000 barrels per stream day (bpsd); the Kaduna Refining and Petrochemical Company Limited (KRPC) with an installed capacity of 110,000 bpsd; and the Warri Refining and Petrochemical Company Limited (WRPC) with an installed capacity of 125,000 bpsd.
All the refineries have a combined installed capacity of 445,000 barrels per day.
For 2017, the Warri refinery functioned highest in January, utilising 42.6 per cent of its capacity. The Port-Harcourt refinery, for the year, functioned at its peak in December, utilising 41.7 per cent.
The Kaduna refinery had the worst performance in terms of capacity utilisation in 2017. It functioned most in February utilising just 34.4 per cent of its capacity.
Also, a consolidated capacity utilisation chart showed that the refineries performed best in January 2017 at 36.73 per cent of 445,000 bpd. September 2017 recorded the worst consolidated capacity utilisation in 2017 at 5.81 per cent. Dearth of TAM
Nigeria’s refineries have suffered lack of proper maintenance for over a decade and this has resulted in gross underperformance.
On the steps taken to increase the utilisation of the refineries, the report showed that NNPC is inching closer to choosing financial advisors for the refineries, as there are plans to rehabilitate and get the refineries utilising up to 90 per cent of their capacities by 2019. The Group Managing Director of the Corporation, Maikanti Baru, in the April 2018 edition of the NNPC NEWS publication, said the nameplate capacity of the refineries (445,000bpd) is likely to increase after the refineries are rehabilitated. Up till now, nothing significant has been recorded. “The programme we have is total rehabilitation, it is no longer a matter of turn– around maintenance because the level of decay is enormous,” he explained. “After the refurbishment, we could get some ‘upsize’ from the debottlenecking side. Whatever upsize that comes will help us increase the volume of petrol that would be coming into the market.” Meanwhile, everyone now knows that refineries functioning at 90 per cent capacity by 2019 as promised by NNPC GMD in 2018 is impossible. Instead of improvement, the refineries, as shown in NNPC’s latest report, decreased in efficiency and profitability. Last line NNPC should block all loopholes that have made the downstream sector a disgrace. While efforts to ensure availability of petrol is commendable, the export of crude meant for local refineries and importation of about two billion litres of petrol in one month should be a major cause for concern for any country that is serious in getting its citizens out of the jaws of abject poverty.
