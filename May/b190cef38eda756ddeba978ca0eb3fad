Syli Nationale of Guinea head coach, Paul Put, has come out with a down-to-earth confession that Nigeria will be a tough opponent for his side at this year’s Africa Cup of Nations starting June 15 in Egypt. Both teams will tango in their second group match on June 26 in Alexandria at the continental football showpiece, and though Guinea enter the game with memories of how they stopped Nigeria from reaching AFCON 2012 in Gabon/ Equatorial Guinea, Put is fascinated by the top quality players in the fold of the three-time African champions. The Belgian gaffer remembers that it was Nigeria that stopped his former team, Burkina Faso, in their first ever AFCON final, at South Africa 2013 – which incidentally is Nigeria’s last appearance at the biennial tourney – and he is apprehensive of suffering the same fate in Egypt. Although it took a slim 1-0 win, courtesy of Sunday Mba’s 40th minute sizzler to help Nigeria carry the day back then in Johannesburg, Put, seems still haunted by the setback. Put declared: “I believe in our chances, but we need to work very hard for it. It will not be easy for us. “We have Nigeria, a strong opponent and I have good memories against them from 2013 with Burkina Faso. “I hope I can make the same experience with Guinea. It will be very difficult to play against them but I hope we can get out of this group. “Madagascar and Burundi are seen as outsiders but it is never easy playing against outsiders. “It is not easy and maybe we will have to play until the last day of the group.”
