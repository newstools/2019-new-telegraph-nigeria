A 51-year-old trader, Joseph Nwankwo, who was charged with stealing N1.7 million,  on Wednesday, appeared before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court. The defendant, who resides at Ikotun, Lagos, was brought before Magistrate M.O. Tanimola, on one count of stealing but he pleaded not guilty to the charge. The court, however, admitted Tanimola to bail in the sum of N500,000 with two sureties in like sum. He said that the sureties should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The prosecutor, Insp Aondohemba Koti, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on Feb. 19 at Ladipo in Mushin, Lagos. He said that the defendant collected N1.7 million from one Mr Joseph Musedu on the pretext of helping him to buy a Yamaha 200 HP engine, a representation he knew to be false. “After the defendant collected the money from the complainant, he converted it to his own use. “Efforts made by the complainant to get the engine or retrieve his money proved unsuccessful. “The complainant reported the case, and the defendant was arrested,” the prosecutor said. According to him, the alleged offence violates Section 287 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 287 stipulates three years’ imprisonment for stealing. The case was adjourned until May 20 for mention. (NAN)
