INEC had refused to issuea certificate of returnto Okorocha despite beingannounced the winner ofthe election because theReturning Officer for theelection, Professor FrancisIbeawuchi, said the declarationof Okorocha as winnerof the election was madeunder duress.But the governor arguedthat going by the laws governingelections in the country,since the election hadbeen concluded and a winnerannounced, INEC had no right not to issue him acertificate of return.
