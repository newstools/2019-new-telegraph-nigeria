The President of TEKAN, Rev. Dr. Caleb Ahima, has declared his intention for the Presidency of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) scheduled to hold next month. TEKAN, a conglomeration of 15 churches in Northern Nigeria under the aegis of Tarayar Ekklisiyoyin Kristi A Nigeria (meaning, Fellowship of the Churches of Christ in Nigeria) belong to the same bloc with Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA).  The ambition of Ahima was ratified during the recently concluded TEKAN General Assembly held at the Headquarters of the Church of the Brethren in Nigeria in Kwarhi- Mubi, Adamawa State. By this, he would slug it out with the incumbent President of CAN and President of Nigerian Baptist Convention, Rev. Dr. Samson Supo Ayokunle, whose regime has suffered one controversy or the other including his recent pilgrimages to the Presidential Villa.  Ahima, who noted that ECWA has keyed into his aspiration to join the race as the next CAN president successfully, maintained that all efforts by detractors to break the unity of the bloc have been futile, as it is God who gives leadership. “The journey to leadership cannot be permitted in any way to divide God’s people or be allowed to cast aspersion on the image of the church.
