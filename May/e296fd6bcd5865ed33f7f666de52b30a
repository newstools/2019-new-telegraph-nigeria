The Bank of Ghana (BoG) has threatened to close down forex bureaus that are not complying with its operational regulations. In a letter sent to the Forex Bureaux Association, BoG named 38 forex bureaux that it said were not complying with its regulations.
They have been cited for non-compliance of various regulations including non-renewal of licences, failure to submit audited accounts, failure to submit monthly financial reports and failure to operate within a period of 2 years. Some were also cited for failure to check the IDs of individuals who did business with them.
According to the BOG’s Forex Bureau Regulations, forex bureaux operators must capture all purchases and sales electronically and issue receipts accordingly. Also, all customers must provide valid national identification or other valid personal ID such as Voter’s ID, Passport or Driver’s License when engaging in forex transactions with Forex Bureau.
In addition, all licensed Forex Bureaux must submit the required monthly returns electronically to the Bank of Ghana within five (5) working days after the end of the month. The Bank of Ghana had warned that failure to do all these will result in the revocation of license of defaulters. The affected operators have up to May 15 to comply with the requirements or risk losing their licenses.
Analysts point out that Nigeria also has strict operational regulations for its Bureaux De Change (BDC) sub-sector
