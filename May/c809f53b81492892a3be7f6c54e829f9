Super Eagles goalkeeper, Ikechuwuku Ezenwa, has said that he is not concerned if he ends up as number one, as that decision solely rests with handler of the team, Gernot Rohr. There have been suggestions that former Enyimba shot stopper, Ezenwa would take over the number one jersey, especially after Francis Uzoho’s Cyprus issue as well as his mistake in the last AFCON qualifier against Seychelles. Speaking with reporters, Ezenwa said that he was ready to give his best whenever called upon to man the sticks. “The manager has the final say. Whenever the opportunity has been given to me, I just have to make good use of it”. “The most important thing is that am focused on my career at the moment and anything about me being number one is totally left for the manager to decide”, the Katsina United goalkeeper explained. There have been doubts over Francis Uzoho’s form this term in Cyprus due to lack of playing time and other sundry issues and Super Eagles Manager has expressed deep concern over this. Super Eagles goalkeepers trainer Alloy Agwu has said the number one position will be contested for by the three goalkeepers named for the tournament with the gloves going to the best among the trio.
