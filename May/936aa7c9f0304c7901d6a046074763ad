The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in Borno State has declared that the Boko Haram insurgency led to the death of 800 civil servants in the state.
The NLC chairman, Comrade Bulama Abiso, who spoke yesterday at the Workersâ€™ Day celebration held at the Ramat Square, Maiduguri, appealed to the state government to pay compensation to the families of over 800 workers killed during the Boko Haram insurgency.
Abiso said out of the 800 workers killed by the Boko Haram, 500 are primary school teachers, about 200 local government staff and 100 health workers.
He called on the outgoing administration of Governor Kashim Shettima to pay all outstanding gratuities owed workers before expiration of his tenure.
He urged Governor Shettima to offset over N20 billion gratuities owed retired workers in the state since 2013.
He further urged the Borno State government to hasten the implementation of N30,000 minimum wage. Abiso urged the state government to provide more job opportunities for the youth as a panacea for not only solving societal ills, but also fill the gap created by retirees leaving the civil service.
On his part, Governor Shettima acknowledged the demands of workers and reiterated that efforts are being made to ensure entitlements of workers are fully paid within available resources.
Shettima, represented by the state Head of Service, Alhaji Mohammed Hassan, called on the organised labour to be proactive and dedicated to their duties for the development of the state.
