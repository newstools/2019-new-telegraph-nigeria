Following the first quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showing that the country’s economy grew by 2.01 per cent on year-on-year basis in real terms, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), alongside other members of the Organised Private Sector of Nigeria (OPSN) have attributed such to federal and state governments’ failure to focus on the economy during the electioneering period. Reacting to the recently released NBS’ report on Nigerian GDP with New Telegraph in Lagos, Director- General, MAN, Segun Ajayi-Kadir, explained that the association and the OPSN had continued to call for continuous improvement in the country’s operating environment to ensure the smooth running of the economy amid heightened political activities. Ajayi-Kadir noted that the manufacturers were not surprised with the NBS report that showed the country’s economy grew by only 2.01 per cent on yearon- year in the first quarter of the year. According to him, it would be absurd to see any growth in the manufacturing sector in an economy already abandoned for electioneering campaign, whereby all machinery of government had shifted to political campaigns.He noted that in the latest NBS report, the performance of the manufacturing sector, which was standing at 0.81per cent for first quarter 2019 fell by 2.59 percentage point when compared with 3.4 per cent of first quarter 2018 and by 1.54 percentage points when compared with 2.35 per cent of fourth quarter 2018. The MAN director-general stressed that captains of industry like chief executive officers (CEOs) of firms had already predicted this during the Manufacturers CEOs Confidence Index (MCCI) report of the association, which showed the picture of a sector with dwindling performance. To him, CEOs of manufacturing concerns expressed an uninspiring confidence on the economy 51.3 points, which was slightly above the minimum benchmark performance of 50 points. Hence, Ajayi-Kadir noted that government needed to pay more attention to the challenges hindering optimum utilisation of the capacity in the sector and the economy at large. “The year-on-year comparison shows that economic growth of 2.01 per cent increased by 0.12 percentage points when compared with 1.89 per cent of the first quarter of 2018; while on quarter-onquarter comparison, the performance of the economy declined by 0.37 points when compared with 2.38 per cent recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018.
