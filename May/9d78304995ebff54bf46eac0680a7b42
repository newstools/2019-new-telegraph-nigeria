Adesomoju maintained that the current fees of N250,000 which was increased last year has not brought any infrastructural development to institutions in the state. His words ” We are here this morning to make our demand known once again. ” We are telling Governor Akeredolu that our school fees must be reduced now because there will be no resumption unless the fees are reduced. ” It is our right to have education but the governor is gradually taking it away from us with his policies. ” If the governor wants to generate revenue, he should look elsewhere not our Schools. ” We are sending him a clear message today that, we will not leave this road until he reduces the fees and he should not have in mind to open the schools without reduction. We are going to resist it. ” You can see we are here but not the governor’s office because he(Akeredolu) has said he will flush us out if we dare protest.” <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/unnamed.jpg?resize=740%2C740&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="740" height="740" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-212724" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/unnamed.jpg?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/unnamed.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/unnamed.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/unnamed.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/unnamed.jpg?resize=80%2C80&amp;ssl=1 80w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" data-recalc-dims="1"> Also speaking, a former NANS JCC chairman, Kowe Odunayo criticised the governor for the increased in school fees, adding that they would resist all means by the government to commercialized education in the State. His words: ” Education is our right and we are here fighting for it. We want to put it to Governor Akeredolu that if he does not reduce the fees, there will not b reduction, he should know that. ” We read during his time in the university, if their chicken was not enough, they fought for chicken not school fees.
