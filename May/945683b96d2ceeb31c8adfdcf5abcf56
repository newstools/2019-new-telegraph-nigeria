Consumers of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) also known as cooking gas in Nigeria will no longer own gas cylinders. The Federal Government, which gave this hint yesterday, maintained that it was coming up with a policy that would strip LPG consumbreakdown ers of cylinders ownership.  This came as the government struck a deal with two original cylinder manufacturers to deliver 600,000 cylinders to LPG distributors on credit.  This is with a pre-payment period of 18 months. Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu, said at a stakeholders’ forum on LPG penetration in Abuja, that the policy would require that the ownership of the cylinders rests strictly with the dealers and distributors. This, he noted, was part of strategy to deepen the penetration of LPG, also known as cooking gas and address issues of safety.  “The Federal Government has reached an agreement with two original cylinder manufacturers to deliver 600,000 cylinders to LPG distributors on credit, with a pre-payment period of 18 months,’ he said. The minister stated that the Federal Government would in the next couple of days commence the clampdown of illegal roadside LPG dealers.
