Super Eagles’ skipper, Mikel Obi, put up a heroic display on Sunday which he capped by scoring a goal to give his Championship side Middlesbrough a 2-0 win over Rotherham United but it was not enough for the Riverside outfit to clinch a top-six finish for a play-off into the lucrative English Premier League. Boro, managed by Tony Pulis, went to the game in seventh place on 70 points one less than Derby who occupied the final play-off spot on 71 points. Needing to win their final match to have any chance of an elite class return, Boro openedthescoreinthe18thminutethrough BrittAssombalongaandMikelwasonhand todoublethevisitors’leadinthe37thminute.
