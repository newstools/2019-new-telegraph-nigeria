Coach Usman Abdallah of the Nigeria senior volleyball women’s team, has promised to secure the ticket to the 2019 All Africa Games in Morocco.
The All Africa Games Qualifiers will hold from June 2nd to 6th, 2019 in Abuja.
Abdallah, who revealed that the women’s senior team has been responding positively to training, added that he is not under any pressure to deliver the ticket for his country.
He said, “We have been in camp for almost ten days now and the girls are responding to training. I have also noticed a lot of improvement as far as the team is concerned. Thirty players were invited to camp and trimmed down to 18, it is encouraging.”
He further said, “We were given a job to make sure we get the female team qualified for the All Africa Games, I do not think we are under pressure because the male team qualified. I believe that it is something the players and coaches want the country to qualify.
“The federation has created an enabling environment for Nigeria to qualify. The president is always here to watch the girls train and I think it is also a motivation to have him here all the time.” “Right now, we do not have any professional player in camp but what we are planning is to invite some of them after we qualify for the all Africa Games. We will try to see to who to invite and those who are ready to help will be invited because they are exposed. Currently, we have new crop of players coupled with old players so that they can mix up,” Abdallah said.
