Gunmen suspected to be cultists on Saturday opened fire at football fans watching the FA Cup match in a hotel between Man City and Watford in Jos, Plateau State. “Heavily armed men stormed the Garden Palace Hotel and Bar at Busa Buji, about five kilometres west of the city’s Terminal Market about 7p.m. local time,” a witness said. A resident of Busa Buji, Philip, who escaped being killed, said that during the incident, a local footballer identified as John Davou, was hit three times in the head by the gunmen who also killed another young man instantly, while injuring several others. He said: “What I know is that during the attack, John Davou, 25, died instantly, while another man, Mr. Francis Bot, who was sitting close to him, sustained bullet wounds.
“Several others also sustained injuries while trying to escape from the scene.” Another resident, Mathew, said: “I suspect that Davou was probably the target, because he was the only one pelted with bullets while everyone else only sustained injuries, some with bullet wounds.
“The victim recently sat for the 2019 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and had hoped to gain admission into the university before he was killed by the gunmen,” another resident, Mathew, said.
