After five days of skilful displays at the first phase of the Prudent Energy Handball League in Abuja, Technical Director of the Handball Federation of Nigeria (HFN), Ferdinand Emeana has declared that that are no clear favourites for the titles. Emeana based his submission of the fact that most of the teams have improved compared to last year when they (the teams) were yet to come to terms with the rising standard of the game. He also stated that the fact that the defending champions in both categories have drawn and lost game has shown the intense nature of this year’s championship. “My im- pression from the games so far played is that handball is moving forward. T h e standard t h i s year is very high and there are no clear favourites compared to last year when Niger United and Plateau Peacocks were clear favourites after two games. “Most of the teams are strong contenders and the outcome of most of the games has shown that all the teams are in the race for the title,” he added.
