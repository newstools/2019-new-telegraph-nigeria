The dream of the School of Basic Midwifery, Amachara (SOBMA) in Umuahia, Abia State to attain full accreditation of its programmes may be a forlorn, if basic facilities required for the training of students are not put in place by the management before the visit of the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria (NMCN), the professional accreditation body of the institution. The Principal of the school, Mrs. Priscilla Ugorji, who expressed worry over the development, listed some of the facilities and equipment required for the exercise to include, well-equipped hostels, adequate manpower (academic and non-academic staff), classrooms, computer laboratory, audio and visual room, demonstration room, office equipment and offices for staff members. Ugorji, who spoke during the capping/matriculation of students admitted for the 2018 Midwifery programme, pointed out: “We have several challenges facing us, as a school, and these requirements should be met before the next visit of Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria for the accreditation of our programmes, which is coming up in couple of months for full accreditation of the school.” The Principal further disclosed that out of 40 student midwives that started the journey six months ago, only 30 passed after the Preliminary Training School (PTS) examination. “The journey began several months ago. It is a paramount and crucial period for every Basic Nursing and Midwifery School. It is a time of intensive training and academic activities, and a critical time as it involves serious academic drillings. Besides, it is also a period of separation for those that will continue with the academic journey as professional midwives.”
