The Nigerian Baptist Convention (NBC) has raised the alarm over the rising killings across the country, especially in the northern part, saying that Boko Haram insurgents are taking over lost grounds while the security agencies stand helpless. While calling on the Federal Government to take urgent steps to address the situation, the Convention also called on the Judiciary, to be independent and not allow itself to be hijacked.  It challenged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to be guided by the true tenets of the organisation by discharging its duties fearlessly in an independent and objective manner.  These and many more resolutions were contained in the communiqué issued by the Convention, under the leadership of the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev (Dr.) Samson Supo Ayokunle, at the close of its 106th Annual Session, which took place in Ogbomoso, Oyo State.  In a statement containing details of the resolutions signed by the Special Assistant (Media and Communications) to Ayokunle, Pastor Oladeji Adebayo, the Christian group also called on the ruling Action Progressives Congress (APC) not to gag members of the National Assembly but give them the free rein to choose their leaders. The Convention also passed a vote of confidence on Ayokunle and endorsed him for a second term in office as president of CAN.  “It is an understatement to say that there are security challenges in Nigeria today. We observed with disappointment the unchecked attack of both Nigerians and foreigners due to terrorist and various criminal activities in the country,’’ said the communiqué.
