Several people were injured yesterday when a commercial bus rammed into another bus at Odo Eran bus stop near Pleasure on the Abeokuta-Lagos Expressway.  A witness, who gave his name as Michael, said the accident occurred because the 22-seater bus did not park at the designated bus stop. He added that another 22-seater bus with registration number Lagos KJA 729 XG, which had a brake failure, ran into the parked bus going towards Iyana-Ipaja.  Michael blamed the parked bus for not parking properly at the designated bus stop. He thanked God for the policemen who quickly came to the scene to rescue some passengers who were trapped in one of the two buses.
