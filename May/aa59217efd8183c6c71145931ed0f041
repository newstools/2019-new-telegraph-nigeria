A trailer yesterday crushed to death a female officer, Remilekun Arogundade, working with the Lagos State Traffic Management Agency (LASTMA). Arogundade was among the officers stationed at Apapa Zone 36  It was learnt that the officer was at the back of the truck when the tragedy occurred. Arogundade’s death came about three years after her zonal head, Bakare, was beaten to death by commercial motorcycle riders and touts at the Apapa area of Lagos.  The circumstance surrounding the tragic incident was still sketchy, but witnesses said the trailer crushed the woman while attempting to reverse.  Arogundade’s body has been evacuated from the scene of the tragedy and deposited at a mortuary. LASTMA officers have been object of attacks and killings in recent times. Bakare was killed on Point Road, Apapa, while enforcing the road traffic law which banned motorcyclists from plying 475 major roads in Lagos. Bakare was attacked and murdered by irate motorcyclists. Last year, an operative of the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS), Inspector Olakunle Olonade, shot dead a LASTMA officer, Rotimi Adeyemo, at Iyana-Ipaja area of Lagos during an altercation.
