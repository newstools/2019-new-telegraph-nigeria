A first class traditional ruler in Osun State, Oba Hammed Adekunle Makama Oyelude, Tegbosun III, Olowu of Kuta land at the weekend commended the Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Buratai, for his promise to complete all over 70-yearold bridge that links the town and Ede community in the state.  The monarch, who expressed happiness over the development while leading 12 members of Engineering Corps from the Nigeria Army to the bridge that serves as boundary between Kuta and Ede communities, described the Nigerian Army’s visit as heroic and significant.  He said:”The bridge, which linked the two communities, had been started by the forefathers of the two communities through contribution among themselves and which is yet to see the light of the day. “This prompted me to send a compassionate appeal on behalf of the people of the two communities to the Nigeria Army and I thank God today, that the visit of the Engineers from the military is a good omen.  “The completion of the bridge will not only boost the economy of Ede and Kuta, but will also increase the Internally Generated Revenue of Osun State.  “If the bridge is done, the economic impact cannot be over-emphasized. The IGR of the state will also improve because human and goods could be moved easily. “Our forefathers that started the bridge knew the economy importance before embarking on contributions among themselves. We thank the Chief of Army Staff for the move to complete the bridge.  Military are not only fighting insurgency, they are opening up access.” Also,Timi of Ede, Oba Munirudeen Adesola Lawal, commended the Olowu Kuta for using the relationship he enjoyed with the army chief to facilitate development that would be of benefit to the coming generation. He, however, pledged that the bridge would not cause any conflict between the two towns but instead, it will further promote cordial relationship between them.
