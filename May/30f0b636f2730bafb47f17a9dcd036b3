Several people were on Monday afternoon injured when a Kano bound train derailed between Maikunkele and Jangaru in Bosso local government area of Niger state. The New Telegraph gathered that the accident was caused by cattle crossing the railway and the train rammed into them. The incident according to an eyewitness report has it that the two first-class coaches that are joined to the engine were not affected but the canteen and the second class coaches reportedly fell off the rail track while in motion, causing it to derail. This however caused tension among passengers on the train who struggled for safety by trying to escape through the windows of the affected coaches thereby leading to a lot of injuries. The train was said to be coming from Lagos and heading to Kano before the incident happened. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/w.png?resize=502%2C712&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="502" height="712" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-208938" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/w.png?w=502&amp;ssl=1 502w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/w.png?resize=212%2C300&amp;ssl=1 212w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px" data-recalc-dims="1"> Our Correspondent gathered that five coaches in all were affected as the train had been on the rail from for the past three days.
