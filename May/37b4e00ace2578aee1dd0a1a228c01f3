A Grade I  Area Court sitting in Mpape, Abuja, on Monday sentenced two applicants to three months in prison for two Techno cellphones, valued at N40,000. Magistrate Abdullahi Gedengbe sentenced Abba Adamu and Abdulrahman Usman, after they pleaded guilty to joint act and theft. Gedengbe, however, gave the convicts an option to pay fine of N15,000 each. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Haruna Ibrahim, told the court that the matter was first reported at the police station by one Jonah Busa of Gwari Village, Mpape on April 19. He said the convicts with one Nura, now at large, entered the complainantâ€™s house and stole two cellphones valued at N40, 000. Ibrahim said that the phones were recovered from their possession during investigation. He said that the offence contravened the provisions of sections 97 and 287 of the Penal Code. (NAN)
