Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi has enjoined members of his cabinet to work assiduously for his administration to deliver good performance to the people, saying his succession plan would be determined largely by level of dividends of democracy offered the people of Ekiti. According to Fayemi, Ekiti people must start seeing evidence of governance now that a full complement of commissioners and Special Advisers had been appointed to drive his 4-cardinal agenda. The governor spoke at the Royal Park Hotel, Iloko Ijesa, Osun State yesterday while declaring open a three-day retreat organised by the state government to equip the political class and technocrats in the state civil service. The theme of the retreat was-Restoring Ekiti Value: From Promise to Reality. Over 100 senior public servants in the state attended the retreat. Fayemi stated that even apart from new minimum wage, which he said his government was ready to pay to workers, there werre more obligations to attend to. He enjoined participants to be creative in their offices for positive delivery including those in charge of revenues to come up with strategy to generate more revenue to be able to meet the new demand. Fayemi said: “We have to be focused on how to deliver on our promises to the people, and that is why you will sign to performance agreement at the end of every quarter and if you think what we set for you is too high, then you bow out. “We have to take reclaiming Ekiti values from the level of promise to reality. I know you need resources and there must be plans on how these will be provided and measured the extent to which you have delivered.”
