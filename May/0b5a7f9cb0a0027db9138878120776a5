For respected and popular man of God and founder of Daystar Christian Centre, Pastor Sam Adeyemi and wife, Nike, these are certainly great times for them as their son, David, just made them proud. David completed his studies at the prestigious Emory University in faraway Atlanta, Georgia. Their joy knew no bounds as David Adeyemi, one of the three children their union is blessed with, was conferred with the school’s Bachelor of Arts degree at the One Hundred and Seventy-fourth Commencement of the grand old school recently. Emory University is ranked within the top 80 in the world by reputable ranking bodies. The Adeyemis were in high spirits during this year’s degree-award ceremony of the acclaimed institution. Attired in brown suit and yellow skirt with white, black-belted shirt respectively, Sam and Nike were grinning from ear to ear like two happy Cheshire cats as they clapped, congratulated and posed with their son on bringing honour to the family through his academic exploits.
