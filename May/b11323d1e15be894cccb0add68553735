  The Joint National Association of Persons with Disability (JONAPWD), an umbrella for persons living with disability (PLWD) has threatened to drag the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to court for allegedly violating Disability Law. The group in a letter dated 2nd May, 2019 and addressed to the NNPC Group Managing Director, Mr. Maikanti Baru, expressed its displeasure at the corporation’s failure to make provisions for its members in its just concluded online employment application process.
The letter was a follow up to an earlier one written by a member of JONAPWD, Mr. Unini Emeka, who accused NNPC of not providing disability components needed by him to apply for job on its website. JONAPWD in the letter signed by its Acting President disclosed that it would not tolerate a situation whereby its members were shut out by any organization in their quest to be gainfully employed. This, JONAPWD said NNPC’s action was a violation of the Disability Law- the Nigerian Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act, 2019, recently signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari.
It, however, sought an audience with the NNPC’s management to promptly arrange a meeting with it to resolve the contending issues or resort to litigation with a view to seek redress. Emeka had in his letter dated 18th March, 2019, accused NNPC of failure to provide a column where Persons with Disability would apply for job opportunity online is fatal to its quest for employment. “I am writing to complain that no column was provided for people with disability in the ongoing employment process on organization employment website. I experienced less favorable treatment when I was filling the form on your organization website,” Emeka’ said.
