Kano State chapter of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN) has called on the Federal Government to ensure appropriate pricing of wheat to encourage farmers engage in large scale production of the commodity.  AFAN Chairman in the state, Alhaji Faruk Rabi’u, made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kano. Rabi’u said the inappropriate pricing and a ready market for the commodity had discouraged a number of farmers in the state from engaging in large production of the commodity.  “The production of wheat has continued to decline since 2017, when farmers cultivated over 30, 000 hectares. “In 2018 and 2019, only 10, 000 hectares were cultivated. This shows that wheat production is going down because of lack of ready market and good pricing,” he said.  According to him, if government and millers associations can come up with a minimum guarantee price, it will go a long way in encouraging more farmers to go into it production. “This is because any farmer, who sells the commodity at the prevailing market price, will definitely sell the commodity at a loss.
