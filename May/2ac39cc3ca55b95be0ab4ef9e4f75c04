Members of the dreaded Boko Haram group have killed about 26 people while many others were critically injured in Madagali Local Government Area of Adamawa State. A community leader and a resident of the community, Abawu Miana Ularamu, said the suspected Boko Haram members rode on motorcycles in large numbers from Kudakaya village in Madagali, about 7p.m. on Monday.   Abawu Maina Ularamu, a former Madagalli Local chairman, described the incident as one of the worst series of attacks being witnessed in the recent times as “they burnt several shops and many homes and also stole food.” He said: “As I am talking to you, we are living in an atmosphere of despair and agony over this attack. Over 26 people were killed, while many who were injured were rushed to the hospital.  “There is no doubt that the attackers came from Sambisa Forest. We usually experience such periodic attacks from Boko Haram, who usually look for food. “Already, residents are fleeing for fear of uncertainty; they (Boko Haram members) are not far away with us, any slight opportunity they may strike again.”  The insurgents had last week attacked three villages. On their way out, they ran into vigilantes on patrol at Kuda village, who engaged them in a shootout; killing two of the attackers. Also, a vigilante said “many people fell victims to the attack. I personally counted 26 corpses who were killed while those injured were taken to the hospital for treatment.”  Meanwhile, the police confirmed that Boko Haram attacked a community in Madagali Local Government Area and killed no fewer than 26 people. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Othman Abubakar, said he was briefed that members of the dreaded Boko Haram group have attacked a community in Madagali Local Government Area. He said: “Though I am yet to get the actual casualty figure, security operatives were deployed to the area and are on top of the situation.”
