The Vice Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP), Mr. Peter Obi, has congratulated leaders sworn in across the country yesterday. He reminded them that by their swearing-in, they have begun the journey of retrieving Nigeria from its present decay. In a release made available to the press by his Media Office yesterday, Obi urged them not to allow the ecstasies of their elevation to becloud their sense of purpose. Describing their swearing in as historic, coinciding with 20 years the nation has practiced uninterrupted democracy, he reminded them that they are saddled with the task of repairing our chequered democracy, which is now going through a tough time. In Obi’s words: “How you start will define how you will continue and probably end.” Obi charged them to start auspiciously. Further, Obi said: “Nationally, yesterday was a great day for the country and a very special day for you. My appeal is that you take the moment to reflect about the country, about the life of service and about the condition of Nigeria.” Obi said that upon reflection, he was sure they would realize that they have a lot of work to do in different aspects. His words: “You are embarking on a serious journey. Our country is today negative in all indices of development.”
