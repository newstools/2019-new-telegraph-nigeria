Counterfeit drug from India is on the increase despite some measures   Importation of pharmaceutical products to Nigeria has increased by 30.3 per cent from $358.04 million to $513.89 million in the last one year, New Telegraph has learnt.
Data by the International Trade Statistics (ITS) explained that Nigeria imported $357.94 million worth of pharmaceutical from four countries in 2018. Last year, it said that the country’s imports from India surged from $167.9 million in 2017 to $205.36 million, leading to 18.22 per cent increase in 2018. Also, the data revealed that pharma imports from China increased to $94.63 million from $84,50 million; Netherlands from $7.39 million to $32.29 million and United Kingdom from $15.86 million to $25.44 million in the same period. It was learnt that India is leading other pharma exporters to the country despite seizures of fake pharmaceutical products by the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) from Indian smugglers. Last year, the service seized some banned drugs valued at N2.76 billion from smugglers between January and August, 2018. Data from the service in Lagos revealed that the drugs, mainly codeine syrups and tramadol, were imported from India, as Nigeria has become emerging market for pharmaceutical products due to the low levels of health infrastructure.
Also, data by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) revealed that between 2013 and 2015, the country imported a total of $1.64 billion pharmaceutical products. Some of pharmaceuticals were imported from India, China, Europe and United States through the Apapa seaports, Calabar Port and Rivers Port. The pharmaceutical imports data revealed that in 2013, the country imported $481 million worth of pharmaceutical products; $550 million in 2014 and $610 million in 2015.
The firm also revealed that in June, 2014, top medical tourist destinations by Nigerians include India, Europe, the United States and the Persian Gulf. It added that 47 per cent of Nigerians who visited India in 2012 spent $260 million on treatment on brain surgery, cosmetic surgery, cancer, renal transplant, eye treatment and open heart surgery. The Pharmaceutical Export Promotion Council of India (Pharmexcil) also said that Nigeria, which was one of the leading importers of Indian high quality generics consumed some medicines valued at $344 million in 2017. Worried that 70 per cent of finished pharmaceutical products used in Nigeria are imported, President of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN), Ahmed Yakasai, complained in Ilorin that the 30 per cent of the total quantity of drugs manufactured locally in the country were not enough. He said: “We agreed that local manufacturers in the country would be producing 70 per cent of the drugs for local consumption and 30 per cent to be imported.” However, he noted that it was sad that Nigeria still imports drugs from China, Pakistan and Ghana instead of exporting them. To reverse the situation, industrial pharmacists in the umbrella of Association of Industrial Pharmacists of Nigeria (AIPN) also recently stressed the need in Anambra State by the pharmaceutical industry in the country to begin to innovate towards the transformation of the industry.
The association advocated strategic innovations and a brand new approach to transform the nation’s pharmaceutical industry for
