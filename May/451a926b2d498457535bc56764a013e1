Famous musician, Burna Boy, has kicked against Nigerian artistes signing record deals with international labels.
In a post on his Snapchat page, he said he felt sorry for those signing such international deals, describing them as “victims”.
The bubbly act vowed that he would never sign any deal with international record labels.
“I feel so sorry for all you Nigerian artistes jumping into these international deals. You guys don’t know what you’re doing. I will forever be grateful and thankful to my manager/mother for making sure I will never be an international victim.
“I feel bad for every single one of you. I heard some really crazy shit out here. I’m so sad for you all.”
Burna boy made this remark shortly after words went to town that Tiwa Savage had exited Mavin Records and clinched a new deal with Universal Music Group, an American music company, that boasts of artistes like Rihanna, Taylor Swift, and Lady Gaga.
