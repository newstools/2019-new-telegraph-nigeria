…says: I almost signed for Arsenal   Villarreal of Spain striker, Samuel Chukwueze, might be set to dump summer transfer offers from Olympique Marseille of France and Valencia of Spain, as he has set his mind on starring next season in the English Premier League. The talented teenager, who was linked with Liverpool and Manchester City in big money deal earlier this week, is sure of a summer exit from The Yellow Submarine, and latest reports hint he could be on his way to England next month. The Chile 2015 FIFA U-17 World Cup revelation, whose buy-out clause at Villarreal is now said to be beyond €80m, missed out on a deal with Arsenal in 2016. Chukwueze stated: “Playing in England is still an ambition for me. I need to keep on working hard and to keep improving. “I really want to play in England. I think so. It was very close for me to sign for Arsenal, I almost had the contract in my hands. “I was very happy thinking of signing and playing for Arsenal, but my academy did not allow it to happen. “Unfortunately, it did not work out fine with my academy due to the side of agreement and payment. “They did not agree with the terms of the contract. I kept on pushing and praying to get a club in Europe and it came with Liverpool.” The 19-year-old winger-cumstriker has emerged as one of La Liga’s most exciting talents during the current campaign, having scored 10 goals and provided five assists across all competitions. He is also on the cards for three of Nigeria’s national teams, with spots assured for him in the Super Eagles (senior), Olympic Eagles (U-23) and Flying Eagles (youth), for which he has already been listed for the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup taking place later this this month in Brazil.
