Coalition of South- East Youth Leaders (COSEYL), has described the recent verbal attacks on the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Nwabueze Ngige by Comrade Ayuba Wabba, Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) as “insulting and unwarranted.” The NLC Chairman in his recent statement accused Dr. Ngige to have hired thugs to beat up protesting NLC members in Abuja. Wabba also said that Ngige is not fit to be a minister and further alleged that the only reason Ngige is opposed to Chief Frank Kokori becoming the Chairman of Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund, (NSITF) was because Kokori cannot be compromised. The Labour Chairman who is also president of International Trade Unions Confederation (ITUC) global said a directive was issued to all 162 members countries to picket Ngige and members of his family anywhere around the world. However, in a statement addressed and signed by its President-General, Chief Goodluck Ibem and the Secretary-General, Comrade Kanice Igwe yesterday in Aba, Abia State, the group said that it is insulting and regrettable for Wabba to have made such derogatory and life threatening remarks on a gentleman like Ngige. In the statement they said: “We condemn in strong terms the continuous protest by Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) led by Ayuba Wabba even when president Muhammadu Buhari has directed the Minister of Labour and Employment to inaugurated Austin Enajemo-Isire as Chairman of NSITF and Mrs Ijeoma as Secretary. “The situation where Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) Chairman will say that Dr. Chris Ngige is not qualified to be a medical doctor, but a native doctor is regrettable, insulting and unwarranted.
