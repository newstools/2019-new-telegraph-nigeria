 Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) will today arraign an official of the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Philomina Chieshe, who claimed that a snake swallowed N35 million at the Makurdi, Benue State office of the board.
Chieshe, according to the Acting Head, Media and Publicity of EFCC, Tony Orilade, will be arraigned alongside five others – Samuel Umoru, Yakubu Jekada, Daniel Agbo, Priscilla Ogunsola and Aliyu Yakubu – before Justice Peter Afen of a Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court, Abuja.
Orilade said Chieshe became notorious when she made “an outlandish claim” that a mysterious snake swallowed about N35million cash arising from the sales of e-JAMB cards in the state.
He said: “The controversial JAMB official is being prosecuted by the EFCC on an eight-count charge, following her refusal to furnish the management of JAMB the true information on the financial status of JAMB e-cards supplied to the Benue Zonal office between 2014 and 2016.
“Chieshe’s action is contrary to Section 139 (a) of the Penal Code Law.”
