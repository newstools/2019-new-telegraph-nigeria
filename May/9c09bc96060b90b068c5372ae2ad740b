President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday reviewed the relationship between the Executive arm of the government and the outgoing 8th National Assembly and concluded that it wasn’t the best.  Speaking at Iftar dinner (breaking of fast) he hosted for the leadership of the National Assembly led by Senate President Bukola Saraki at the State House, Buhari said the nation deserved better than it got and hoped for a better working relationship between the two arms of government with the 9th National Assembly soon to come.  In a statement after the dinner by his Senior Special Assistant in Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, President Buhari said: “Relations between the Executive and the Legislature were not the best in the 8th National Assembly.  I sincerely hope each one of us will do his utmost to ensure there is a better working relationship between these two arms of government in the 9th Assembly, so that we can serve the people better.”  He noted that the principal task of the National Assembly “is to cooperate with the Executive so that together we can fashion policies that will lift our people out of poverty and out of illiteracy. I appeal to the Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members to subordinate all personal interests and ambitions to the imperative of working for the common good of our people.”   The President congratulated the members-elect on their success in winning their constituency seats and opined that “this is a great burden and a great responsibility placed on you by your people. Our citizens are faced with challenges of poverty.   He assured the leaders that his doors remain open “to all of you who have genuine concerns or advice to improve the quality of governance and service delivery to our people.” The President of the Senate, Senator Bukola Saraki assured the President that the National Assembly will maintain focus on national interest at all times.
