The fear of what the future holds is already dawning on some outgoing political office holders in the country who will leave office on or before May 29. Politricks gathered that some of the politicians especially lawmakers who are not returning to their positions have started devising means of staying afloat economically. With relatively huge severance packages expected to hit their pockets at the end of their tenure, some of them have started enlisting the services of professionals, investors and business partners on the best ways to utilize their entitlements, judiciously.  For some of them, they opine that since the ‘free funds’ of government is no longer going to be available to them, they need to manage the resources at their disposal. They intend to invest the monies with them in hotels construction, farming, commodity trading, and landed properties, among others. For some others, they are returning to their professions and businesses which they dumped before taking up political appointments. Life after service!
