Ex-international Garba Lawal has affirmed that the Super Eagles will put up an impressive outing at this year’s Africa Cup of Nations and so there is no cause for alarm over their preparations for the tournament featuring 24 countries in Egypt next month. Nigeria will be making a return to the biennial event with Gernot Rohr’ s side billed to commence preparation with camping in on June 2 and Lawal who featured in three editions for Nigeria is of a view that everything is on course for the three time African champions. “They know what they want to achieve, they know they need the cup. In fact, every team going into a competition wants to win. “Our team also wants to win, and I say there is no cause for alarm, they can be champions of Africa in Egypt,” he said in a live telephone chat on a sports programme monitored in Lagos. Lawal, who is now a member of the technical committee of the NFF admits they must not rest on their oars in order not to be caught off guard by any unsung team during the competition in Egypt and added that every team will be at the 2019 AFCON with the target of winning the title, but believes the Eagles will stand out. He added: “They have what it takes to win, they know what they want and they are ready to go for it. There is no cause for alarm. “They will soon open camp, because the season is ending soon in Europe, which means our players will now concentrate on the Nations Cup. “That’s what they all want, they want to go there and win it for Nigeria. There is no cause for alarm, because they know what they have to do.”
