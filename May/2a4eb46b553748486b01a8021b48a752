  Tume’s face turned chalky white as he stared at the door. Ben swung round and saw nothing. He turned to Tume, who was now shivering. “What’s the matter buddy?” He asked Tume. Tume shook his head and said nothing. Ben looked intently at him and said, “You look like you saw a ghost”. “It would have been good if I saw ghost. I think I did though,” Tume said, not taking his eyes off the door. Ben turned to the door again, there was no one there. He moved to the door and looked out. He saw no one but had a feeling that someone just turned the corner at the end of corridor. Well, it could be any of the nurses, he reasoned. “I’m indebted to you, Ben,” Tume said, not taking his eyes off the door. Ben smiled, moved to where he was sitting and whispered something into his ear. Tume looked at him incredulously then smiled. Ben smiled also and they shook hands. ****** Three weeks later, Tami was back at work. There was no need for her to remain at home. Staying at home while everyone was in the office was depressing. She had to watch it, the alarming increase in the number of suicide cases was cause for concern. <img class="size-medium wp-image-212101 alignleft" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-smelling-evil-11.png?resize=300%2C162&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="162" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-smelling-evil-11.png?resize=300%2C162&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Sweet-smelling-evil-11.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1">“My dear, many people are lonely. Loneliness can cause depression. If you’re not happy and there’s no one to talk to, strange thoughts could take over your mind,” Ben had told her few days after she left the hospital. She knew he was right. Twice or thrice, she had wondered if it wouldn’t be better for her to end it all. She felt there was no reason to continue living. The only reason she could still sleep at night was because her bestie never knew she slept with Tume and got pregnant for him. She had voiced out her thought to Nessa one evening and her bestie nearly had a fit. “Whaaaaaaat? Who put that devilish thought in your head,” Nessa screamed at her, eyes as round as the owl’s. “I mean, what am I living for? I’m lonely. I’m not happy,” Tami said, tears streaming down her cheeks. Nessa calmed her down and assured her that they loved her. She didn’t stop at that, she got the men involved. After thought – provoking sessions with her, she was ashamed to have considered suicide at all. “Did you create yourself? What have you seen in your life that you think someone else hadn’t seen worse? You have a job, you have family and friends that love you so much and you want to end it all? You’re very wicked. So, you never loved us? You have to ask God for forgiveness. OMG! The thought!” Tume was livid with anger. “I didn’t say I wanted to commit suicide. I just wondered…I mean…it just crossed my mind that those people who commit suicide didn’t have people who love them. They had issues they couldn’t handle and had no one to turn to,” Tami stuttered. “That’s a big misconception. They have people who love them so much, who would be ready to help them, but they never sought for help. They never confided in anyone. But what about you? You think we don’t love you? It’s obvious that you don’t love anybody. You also don’t love yourself. You never did. Do you ever think of the heartache the sight of you in a coffin would cause your loved ones? You think being in a tiny coffin would give you joy? Once you’re lowered into that six feet, that’s the end of everything for you. Maybe you should get yourself a cute coffin and place it on your bed. Every night, you lie in there to sleep and practice being dead,” Tume said. Tami flinched several times and stared at him, horror in her eyes. “No! No!! No! I don’t want to die. I never wanted to die. No! Stop! Stop saying those things. You’re scaring me. Please Tume, don’t say such to me again. I don’t want to die. I’ll never ever think of ending it all again. Never again. Please…” she was crying now.
She clung to Tume, shivering. “Please, don’t ever talk of coffins again. Please Tume.” She begged him. They were in his house. His wife was in the kitchen preparing lunch. Nessa ran into the living room. Tami was wailing. “What’s the din about?” she asked. “Tume was scaring me with tales of coffins,” Tami said. “Well, whoever dies will be buried in a coffin. Unless the person wants his or her body to be dumped in a bush so that wild animals will have ready made food for dinner,” Nessa said.
Tami stared at her and suddenly started puking… That was about a week ago. But Dr. Ben had an entirely different solution to Tami’s problem. He wanted her to see a head shrinker. “What? You call me a mad woman?” Tami screamed at him. “No my love. You are definitely not mad. I wouldn’t want to get married to a mad woman you know. It’s a pity that many Nigerians think that only mad people need the services of a psychiatrist. It’s not so. Nothing wrong with seeing a head shrinker to evaluate your mental health. Depression is curable in the hospital. Many people need the services of psychiatrists and psychologists. Well-trained ones abound in Nigeria…” Ben trailed off. Tami was looking at him in a funny manner. He stared at her. “What’s the matter dear?” He asked her. “You said you wouldn’t want to get married to a mad woman…” She said slowly, like someone in a trance. “Yes my love,” Ben said, kneeling down. “Will you marry me?” He asked her. Tami stared at the Adonis kneeling in front of her and tears streamed down her face. “Will you marry me, my beauty queen? I have always loved you. When Nessa walked into my office with you last year, I realised I’ve never stopped loving you despite the years apart. Tell me, do you feel the way I feel about you? Will you marry me?” He asked again. “Yes I’ll marry you Ben. Yes! Yes! Yes! I’ll marry you,” she cried as Ben drew her into his arms. “Sorry I didn’t come with a ring. We’ll both go and choose our wedding rings together,” he said happily. So many things ran through Tami’s mind at the same time as the tears refused to stop. She felt so ashamed of herself. Despite her sins, God still loved her and showed her mercy! She said a silent prayer and resolved to mend her ways with her maker. She just couldn’t contain her joy! The tears ceased and her face broke into a smile. Ben was so happy. Tami couldn’t wait. She called Nessa on the phone to break the good news to her. Nessa was ecstatic. She rushed back home. Tume and Nessa had taken her back to their home from the hospital. When Ben came to their house that Sunday evening, Nessa and Tume had left them alone, with the excuse that they wanted to get some groceries few streets away. Though Nessa was in the dark about what would transpire between Ben and Tami, Tume knew. Ben had confided in him. When they returned and Tume announced that the bottles of wine they bought were for celebration, Nessa and Tami stared at each other for a while before hugging so hard. They held on to each other and cried.
“You’re a man. A real man,” Tume told Ben as they shook hands and hugged.
**** For days to come, Tami’s mind was preoccupied with making conscious effort to stay alive. She felt that the demon that put the thought of suicide in her consciousness could try to cut short her joy. She took extra care to do everything. If she wanted to cross the road, she would look left, right, left, right, uncountable times and ensure that even if she fell down at the middle of the road, she would have ample time to pick herself up and run to safety before the nearest vehicle would get to her.
