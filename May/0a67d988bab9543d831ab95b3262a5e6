Police have apprehended a suspected notorious kidnap kingpin operating a syndicate across Niger State following a tip-off. The suspect, Ibrahim Bahago, of Fulani Camp, Maguda village in Lapai Local Government Area, was arrested by a team of policemen attached to the Lapai Division while trying to escape. It was learnt that the suspect and five members of his group were in a beer parlour discussing how to kidnap Abubakar Sule, a member of a Fulani vigilante group in Kpada. Unknown to the suspected kidnappers, someone in the same beer parlour had already informed the police of their plans to carry out their heinous act. It was learnt that other members of his group ran away at the sight of the operatives.  Bahago told our correspondent that he never knew that anyone was listening to them when they were hatching their plans to kidnap Sule.  He said: “I never knew that some other persons were listening to our conversations, until I found myself in police net. It’s really unfortunate.  “We have been into this act for some time. Although my mind was telling me that one day I will be caught. Now I have brought disgrace to my family. Sincerely, let the law take its course.” The state Police Public Relations Office (PPRO), Muhammad Abubakar, said the suspect confessed to the crime and would be charged to court after investigation.  Abubakar said that Bahago’s house was searched and the operatives recovered one AK47 magazine with 60 rounds of live ammunition, one shirt, two pullover shirts and one container of service oil.
