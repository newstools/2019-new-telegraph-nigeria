The Peoples D e m o c r a t i c Party (PDP) has warned President Muhammadu Buhari not to desecrate the sanctity of the nation’s democracy day by shifting his inauguration for second term in office from May 29 to June 12.  The party also said that moving the inauguration to June 12 would not confer legitimacy to the outcome of the 2019 presidential election, which it said, was rigged in favour of the president. PDP said in a statement yesterday by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan that President Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) were tormented by the guilt of violating the nation’s electoral processes.  “The presidency and the APC from our recent history have demonstrated that they are totally averse to democracy.  “They should therefore steer clear of our Democracy Day, having violated all our democratic ethos in manipulating the presidential elections and upturning the mandate of the people; the same injustice which Chief MKO Abiola, the symbol of June 12, fought and died for,” the party said.  It added that any attempt to schedule any event related to the outcome of the 2019 presidential election on June 12 would be an open desecration of the sanctity of the Democracy Day and a direct assault to the sensibilities of Nigerians.  “Moreover, the PDP rejects this absurd desperation by the Buhari presidency and the APC to overshadow the import of our Democracy Day and stifle the quest by Nigerians to vent their anger against the democratic violations of the APC administration in the last four years,” the statement added.  PDP noted the alleged violation of human rights of Nigerians since the APC came to power, and stated that what was important to Nigerians now was the retrieval of the mandate given to Atiku Abubakar, “at the tribunal so that our nation can enjoy the values of freedom, justice, fairness and equity embedded in our constitutional democracy.”
