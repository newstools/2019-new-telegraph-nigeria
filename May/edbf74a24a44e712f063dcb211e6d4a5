Police in Ogun State have arrested a 52-year-old suspected fraudster, Tayo Ogunmola, for allegedly trying to swindle the state Commissioner of Police, Bashir Makama. The suspect had allegedly made a phone call to the police boss pretending to be an old herbalist. It was learnt that Ogunmola claimed he mistakenly sent a recharge card pin to the telephone number of the police commissioner, asking the latter to send the pin back to him. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the arrest of the suspect in a statement yesterday. Oyeyemi explained that the commissioner, who has been familiar with the antics of fraudsters, decided to play along with the suspect while he sent men of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) to technically track and apprehend him.
The suspect was eventually arrested at his hideout at Ilogbo area of Ota. The PPRO said: “At a stage, the suspect who was not aware that he was being trailed was presenting himself to the commissioner as a Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) who is ready to assist the commissioner only if he can part with certain amount of money not knowing that the person he had been discussing with is a serving commissioner of police. “Luck, however, ran against him when he was traced to his hideout at Araromi Phase II in Ilogbo area of Ota where he was promptly arrested. “On interrogation, he confessed being a fraudster who had defrauded many unsuspecting members of the public of money running to millions of naira out of which he built the house he was living in.” Oyeyemi added that Makama had ordered the monitoring team to properly investigate the suspect with a view to arresting his other accomplices and arraigning them in court.
