 In spite of embarking on aggressive cost-cutting measures in recent years as part of efforts to remain profitable, Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) in Nigeria still continue to grapple with rising personnel costs, findings by New Telegraph show.
For instance, this newspaper’s analysis of the first quarter 2019 results of 10 lenders – Zenith Bank, United Bank for Africa (UBA), Access Bank, Guaranty Trust Bank, FCMB, Union Bank, Fidelity Bank, Stanbic IBTC, Sterling Bank and Wema Bank – shows that they accumulated a total of N95.86 billion in personnel costs in the first three months of this year compared with the N90.60 billion, which they reported for the same period in 2018.
A breakdown of the results indicates that of the 10 banks, Zenith spent the most on personnel expenses in Q1 2019. The Tier 1 lender reported personnel expenses of N18.29 billion in the first three months of this year as against the N15.57 billion it declared for the corresponding period of 2018.
The UBA followed with personnel expenses of N18.09 billion, which was an increase of 3.18 per cent, over the N17.54 billion it reported for the same period in the previous year.
Also, Access Bank’s personnel and rent expenses increased by 4.11 per cent to N13.84 billion in the first quarter of this year, compared with the N13.29 billion it reported for the corresponding period of 2018.
Similarly, Union Bank said it spent N8.79 billion on staff costs in the first three months of this year as against N7.93 billion it reported for the same purpose in Q1 2018.
Tier 2 lender, FCMB’s personnel expenses also headed north in the first quarter of this year, rising to N6.41 billion compared with N5.48 billion in Q1 2018.
Leading Tier 2 bank, Fidelity, equally reported an increase in its staff costs for the first three months of this year to N5.35 billion compared with N5.07 billion in the same period of last year.
The analysis also shows that Sterling Bank’s personnel expenses rose to N3.52 billion in Q1 2019 as against N3.18 billion in Q1 2018.
Likewise, Wema Bank’s staff costs increased to N3.27 billion in the first three months of this year compared with N2.81 billion, the lender reported for the same period of 2018.
However, both GTB and Stanbic IBTC reported a drop in staff costs in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period of 2018. Thus, the former’s staff costs fell to N9.14 billion as against the N9.48 billion it declared for Q1 2018, while the latter said its personnel costs dropped to N9.17 billion compared with N10.28 billion in corresponding period of last year.
Industry analysts point out that in the aftermath of the slump in oil prices in 2015 and the subsequent slipping of the Nigerian economy into recession in 2016, DMBs had to embark on tough cost cutting measures including laying off redundant staff and shutting unprofitable branches as part of their strategy to cope with the harsh times and remain profitable.
In fact, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), 8,663 workers lost their jobs in the first half of 2017. Specifically, the data showed that banks sacked an average of 360 workers every week from January to June 2017.
The NBS also stated that in recent years, banks have been employing more contract staff in their bid to cut costs.
Analysts also note that in addition to laying off redundant staff and shutting unprofitable branches, most lenders have also tried to improve cost-effectiveness by optimizing their various banking channels and reducing IT expenses.
Still, going by their Q1 2019 financial statements, the DMBs do not seem to be succeeding in reducing personnel costs.
Commenting on the bank’s Full Year 2018 and Q1 2019 results, the Chief Executive Officer, Financial Derivatives Company (FDC) Limited, Mr. Bismarck Rewane, stated that while most banks reported increase in Profit After Tax (PAT) and earnings: “Cost structure is a major threat to earnings sustainability.”
The expert also noted: “Tier 2 banks have higher cost-to-income ratio.”
It would be recalled that in a recent report entitled: “The Productivity Agenda – Moving beyond Cost Reduction in Financial Services,” PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) urged banks to look beyond cost-reduction and restructuring measures for profitability and long-term survival.
The multinational professional services network contended in the report that traditional cost-cutting strategies come with inherent limitations, which it said, affect the overall impacts of the strategies on corporate performance and long-term sustainability.
It stated: “With banks struggling to improve their return on capital, many institutions are being forced to restructure and cut costs. Even in the asset management industry, where return on equity is higher than the financial services industry as a whole, there is downward pressure on margins and profitability. Cost cutting will only deliver so much. If financial institutions are to improve profitability in the long-term, they need to fundamentally improve the productivity of the enterprise.”
