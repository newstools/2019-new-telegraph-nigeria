 Former Nigeria international, Victor Agali, has given Super Eagles Head Coach, Gernot Rohr, a ‘vote of confidence’ to do a good job for Nigeria at the forthcoming Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.
While many Nigerians are critical of the Eagles’ chances at the expanded tournament following the nation’s absence in the last two editions, Agali is of the view that the three-time champions will restore their pride stressing the German gaffer knows how to set up a winning squad.
Agali, who spoke live on a sports show in a Lagos-based radio station, on Thursday declared further that the experience of lining out a team at the continental soccer showpiece, is already on hand for the 65-year-old tactician pointing that the gaffer’s experience should come handful when hostilities commence in Pharaoh’s land next month.
The former Hansa Rostock forward stated: “It’s going to be difficult, because we are coming back after a long absence, and other teams are already well-grounded.
“However, we are the favourites in our group, which should give us a good way to start and settle down in the competition.
“I trust our coach, Gernot Rohr, because he knows what he is doing and he knows how to set up a winning team.
“He has been to the Nations Cup before, he has the experience, and he knows how to set up his team to do well.”
Although Agali admitted that it will not be a stroll in the park for Eagles, he reckons that they have a light group to start with, and should be able to go far with Rohr’s expertise.
