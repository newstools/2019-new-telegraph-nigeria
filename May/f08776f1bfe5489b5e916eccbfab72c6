The Executive Chairman of Egbema and Gbaramatu Communities Development Foundation (EGCDF), Ambassador Jude Ebitimi Ukori, yesterday asked management of Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL) to urgently put out fire on the Opuekeba Oil Field at Opuama and Tsekelewu communities.  This was as the Foundation said the call had become necessary in order to avert looming health and environmental hazards, even as the Chairman called on CNL to as a matter of urgent consideration provide relief materials and medical equipment for the affected communities.  Ukori, in a statement, signed on behalf of the Foundation, however, lamented that the fire outbreak could lead to outbreak of diseases, as well as destruction to environment, which consequently would have monumental effects on the livelihood of the people.  “The villagers can no longer go to their farms and to fish for fear of being burnt by the raging fire,” he lamented, saying that the cause of the fire outbreak was yet to be ascertained, but obviously it was as a result of a neglected and untapped facility of Chevron Nigeria Limited.  Ukori, who stressed that if adequate security measures were put in place perhaps the fire incident could have been avoided, further explained that the facility is owned by Chevron Nigeria Limited in Opuekeba Field, hosted by Opuama and Tsekelewu communities within the boundary between Warri North Local Government Area in Delta State and Ilaje Local Government Area of Ondo State.
