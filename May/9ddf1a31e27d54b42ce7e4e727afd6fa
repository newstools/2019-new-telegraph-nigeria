Minister: We’re in a fix on how to bridge funding gap  An increase of N90.3 billion added to 2019 budget by the National Assembly will make implementation of this year’s budget a herculean task, the Federal Government has hinted. The executive arm had sent a budget estimate of N8.83 trillion to the National Assembly for approval, but the legislature approved N8.92 trillion. Speaking at 2019 budget presentation in Abuja, Minister of Budget and National Planning, Senator Udoma Udo Udoma, said government was in a fix on how to raise additional N102.84 billion to bridge the funding gap created in the 2019 budget as a result of the increase of N90.3 billion by the National Assembly.  Udoma said additional figure by the National Assembly has raised budgetary deficits by N58.83 billion; a situation, he said, could put government under pressure of looking for means of containing arising deficit.
“National Assembly increased the budget size from N8.83 trillion to N8.92 trillion, translating to an increase of N90.3 billion. This resulted in an overall increase of N58.83 billion in deficit. “Inexplicably, NASS reduced the proposed borrowing from N1.649 trillion to N1.605 trillion thus creating an overall unfunded deficit of N102.83 billion. To fully fund the budget, the level of borrowing may therefore have to increase.” This was as government put its expected total revenues at N7 trillion to fund the 2019 budget. The estimate comprises N3.69 trillion from oil revenue, N3.31 trillion from non-oil revenues, while the deficit of N1.92 trillion would be financed mainly by borrowing N1.605 trillion split equally between the domestic and foreign markets. The 2019 spending expenditure is expected to be N8.92 trillion. Recurrent non-debt expenditure is pegged at N4.07 trillion; Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs’) capital and capital supplementation is N2.09 trillion; while debt service at N2.14 trillion, is 31 per cent of expected revenues.
Capital expenditure, inclusive of transfers GOEs capital and project-tied loans as of percentage of total FGN expenditure is 31 per cent.
The minister regretted that allocations to key projects were cut while new ones, mainly constituency projects, were introduced. Udoma said the presidency would engage with the 9th National Assembly once it is constituted to address the budgetary quagmire.
Some key assumptions of 2019 budgets are: Oil production: 2.3mbpd.
The government has projected an ambitious 2.3 million barrels per day crude oil production.
The minister said President Buhari has directed the NNPC to take all the possible measures to achieve the target.
Other key assumptions include crude oil benchmark of $60/barrel; exchange rate of N305/$1; GDP growth of 3.01 per cent and inflation rate target of 9.98 per cent.
“The 2019 budget seeks to continue the reflationary and consolidation policies of the 2017 and 2018 Budgets respectively, which helped put the economy back on the path of growth. On the expenditure side, allocations to MDAs of government were guided by the three core objectives of the ERGP, which are, (i) Restoring and Sustaining Growth; (ii) Investing in our people and (iii) Building a Globally Competitive Economy.
“As with 2016, 2017 and 2018 Budgets, the 2019 Budget has been prepared on the Zero Based Budget (ZBB) Principles.”
The minister revealed that President Buhari has directed “the Ministry of Finance, working with all the relevant authorities, to take action to liquidate all recovered, unencumbered assets.
“Given the improved oil prices and production levels, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is to immediately commence the recovery of all outstanding obligations, including those due from Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), a subsidiary of NNPC, which it had agreed to pay since 2017.
“Finally, amongst other revenue generating initiatives, Mr. President has directed that work should be concluded on the deployment of the National Trade Window and other technologies to enhance Customs collections efficiency,” he said.
On performance of 2018 budget, Udoma said: “The overall revenue performance is only 55 per cent of the target in the 2018 Budget partly because some one-off items, such as the N710 billion from Oil Joint Venture Asset restructuring and N320 billion from revision of the Oil Production Sharing Contract legislation/terms, are yet to be actualized and have thus been rolled over to 2019. Of the total appropriation of N9.12 trillion, N6.938 trillion was spent. This represents 79%
