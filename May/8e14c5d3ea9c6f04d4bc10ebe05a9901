Dean of School of Clinical Medicine at Igbinedion University, Prof. Dominic Osaghae, yesterday said Nigeria has the highest concentration of victims of sickle cell disease in the world. Osaghae spoke in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on the sidelines of his inaugural lecture.  The lecture’s theme is: “The Roadblocks on the Highway to Survival of Children: The Intervention of a Pediatrician,” with Osaghae, a professor of pediatrics and child health, defining sickle cell disorders as a hereditary condition and non-communicable disease. “It is the result of a child’s inheritance of the sickle hemoglobin gene either in a double dose (homozygous sickle cell anaemia) or in a combination with other usual hemoglobin (double heterozygous sickle cell disorders,” he said.
