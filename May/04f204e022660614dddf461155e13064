The leadership of various student bodies in Kogi have endorsed Governor Yahaya Bello’s bid for a second term in office, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports. The students, at a press conference on yesterday in Lokoja, said that Bello had performed creditably and deserved four more years. The groups represented included Kogi Chapter of National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), National Association of Kogi Students (NAKOSS), Igala Students Association (ISA), National Association of Ebira Students (NAES), and the National Association of Okun Students (NAOS). Mr Hussein Attaja, spokesman of the students, said that the decision was a fallout of the recent interface by the Conference of All Students Associations where a vote of confidence was passed on the governor. According to Attaja, Bello remains the best option among those considered because he has shown uncommon love for students and their welfare. He urged the national leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC), to ensure due diligence in the electioneering process preceding the Kogi governorship election. Attaja said that the governor had always responded promptly to students’ concerns, and commended his efforts toward ensuring that education calendar was not interrupted, especially in the state-owned tertiary institutions.
