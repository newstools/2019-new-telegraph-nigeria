Country icon Kenny Rogers has been admitted to a Georgia hospital for dehydration, according to his official Twitter account. According to a statement on Friday in the wake of what they deemed “recent wild misinformation and speculation” from a number of unnamed media outlets about the 80 year-old singer’s health. “Kenny was recently admitted to a local Georgia hospital and treated for dehydration,” reads the statement. “Rogers will remain there to complete some physical therapy to get his strength back prior to discharge. He appreciates the concern and well wishes he has received from his fans and can assure everyone he plans on sticking around through the years to come.” After a six-decade career, Rogers retired from performing in Oct. 25, 2017, with an all-star tribute show at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville. He was forced to cancel his planned string of 2018 The Gambler’s Last Deal outing after reportedly suffering from a “series of health issues.” “This will be our last time on stage – forever. It will be worthwhile to come and see that,” Rogers said before the Bridgestone gig. “All In For The Gambler: Kenny Rogers’ Farewell Concert Celebration” featured performances from Rogers, Dolly Parton, Little Big Town, The Oak Ridge Boys, Billy Currington, The Judds, Kris Kristofferson, Lionel Richie, Chris Stapleton, Alison Krauss, The Flaming Lips, Idina Menzel, Jamey Johnson, Elle King and other special guests.
