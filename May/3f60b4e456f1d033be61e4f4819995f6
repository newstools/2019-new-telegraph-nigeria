The bickering between the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and the host communities to its Gas marketing Subsidiary, Nigerian Gas Marketing Company Limited (NGMC) yesterday degenerated. The duo were sharply divided over alleged plans by the NNPC to relocate the NGMC head office from Warri to Abuja, a move alleged to gulp N414 million on rents and others on 12 months.  While the community, which believed that the plan is real, barricaded the NGMC in Warri in protest of the alleged move, the Corporation debunked the belief by the community over the relocation allegation.  “The report trending in the social media purporting planned relocation of the company’s office from Warri to Abuja is fake news,” the NNPC said. Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Mr. Ndu Ughamadu, in a statement, assured members of the host communities who are said to   lay siege on the company premises to return to their normal daily activities, saying NGC office remains in Warri.  The NNPC spokesperson affirmed that the purported plans to spend N120million as yearly rent and another N294million to relocate NGMC to Abuja was false and should be discountenanced by the host communities as well as the general public.  Despite this plea, some members of the company’s host communities barricaded NGMC Office in Warri to protest what they perceived as injustice to their community and gross violation of the principle of fairness.  Ughamadu, however, said the clarification became necessary in view of reports of barricade of NGMC Office in Warri by some members of the company’s host communities, stressing that they should not allow the malicious fake news to incite them against the company which has been carrying out its operations peacefully within the communities for years.
