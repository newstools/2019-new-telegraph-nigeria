President Muhammadu Buhari has awarded a pass mark to the efforts of the Acting Inspector General of Police Muhammad Adamu, saying the fact that the IG has been losing weight is evidence that he is working very hard at securing the nation. Buhari spoke on Sunday on arrival from his 10-day private visit to the United Kingdom.  In a video tweeted by a journalist at the VOA, Saleh Shehu Ashaka, via his verified Twitter handle @AshakaSaleh, a reporter had asked the President: “Are we likely to see a different approach in the fight against insecurity, especially kidnapping, which is a big issue now Sir?” The President responded: “You know, I have just seen the IG, he is… I think he is losing weight; so, I think he is working very hard.”
