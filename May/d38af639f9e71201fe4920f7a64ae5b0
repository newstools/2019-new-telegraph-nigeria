Super Falcons striker, Aisat Oshoala, is lamenting over the ill fortunes that hit her squad and their male team, but believes the ladies’ will make it up to their fans and gain enough consolation by winning the UEFA Women’s Champions League on May 18. Oshoala, who joined the Barca ladies on loan from Chinese click Dalian Quanjian, admitted disappointed that as the ladies failed to win the domestic league title and the men were on Tuesday dumped out of the UEFA Champions League, but the Super Falcons star says all that will be atoned when the Femeni play against Olympique Lyon Ladies on May 18 in Budapest, Hungary, where she says they will win the female final. The Super Falcons star quickly turned her focus away from her side’s failure to win Liga Iberdrola this season, as their title dreams ended with a 1-0 loss to Tenerife at Estadio La Palmera on Sunday. It was a sad anti-climax to the season for Oshoala, who played the whole match, her fifth start in seven league appearances, but she could not add to her current haul of seven goals since joining the Spanish club in January. Barcelona needed a win, while also hoping for Atletico Madrid to slip at Real Sociedad on the same day, but it all ended in dismay for her.
