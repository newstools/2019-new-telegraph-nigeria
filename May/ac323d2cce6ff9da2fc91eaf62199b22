Four people have been arrested and arraigned at the Upper Area Court, Mpape in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), for allegedly using cancer victims to beg for arms.
The accused were arrested by the FCT Social Development Secretariat at Kubwa, a satellite town in the FCT.
The accused, three males and one female, were arraigned before Honourable Hassan Muhammad.
They were accused of criminal conspiracy, cheating and extortion of sick and vulnerable people.
According the First Information Report (FIR) presented to the court by a police prosecutor from the FCT Police Command, the accused, Victor, Makinde, Princess and one person who is still at large, were apprehended on May 18 at Kubwa for allegedly assembling cancer patients and taking them round the FCT to solicit for funds.
The report added the accused also acted dishonestly by converting the funds realised on behalf of the sick persons for their personal use.
However, after the offences were read out to them, all the accused denied the alleged offences and pleaded not guilty.
Consequently, following the no guilty plea by the accused, the prosecutor, Donatus Abah, made an application to the court, for them to be remanded in prison pending the hearing.
The defence lawyer, Pius Onigah, swiftly applied for bail to be granted to the accused, saying that the offences were bailable.
After a strong objection to the bail application, the trial judge ordered that accused to be remanded in Keffi Prison, and adjourned the matter till May 29, for hearing proper.
