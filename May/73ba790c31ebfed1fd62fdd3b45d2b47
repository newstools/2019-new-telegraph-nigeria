Afro-fusion artiste, Burna Boy, has revealed that he feels bad for Nigerian artistes who are excited about international deals. The ‘Dangote’ crooner said those artistes don’t know what they are doing because he has heard terrible things. He revealed on social media via his Instastory that he feels sorry for Nigerian singers who chase international deals. Burna Boy went further to thank his mother who also serves as his manager for making sure he does not fall a victim of such deals. “I feel so sorry for all you Nigerians and artists jumping into these ‘international deals’. You guys don’t know what you’re doing. I will forever be grateful to my manager/mother for making sure I will never be an ‘international’ VICTIM. I feel very bad for every one of you. I’m hearing some really crazy shit out here. I feel so sad for you all.” It would be recalled that singers like David, Wizkid, Tekno and even Burna Boy have at one time signed foreign deals which makes them recognised as international artistes today. Meanwhile, Burna Boy recently apologised after kicking a fan who wanted to steal from him at a concert in Zambia. The Nigerian singer visited Zambia where he treated his fans to a mind-blowing concert.
