The Headquarters of Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON)in Abuja was shut down on  Tuesday by workers who barricaded the complex over poor staff welfare. Hard as management tried to weigh in a belated last-minute effort to stave off the protest, aggrieved workers turn down the plea. SON staff under the umbrella body of the Amalgamated Union of Public Corporations, Civil Service Technical and Recreational Services Employees described conditions under which they work as horrific and dehumanizing. They are pressing for immediate approval and implementation of better conditions of service at the agency. One of their grouses was the refusal of Director-General of SON, Osita Aboloma to obey the directive of the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment on voluntarism. Leading his colleagues on the protest, Chairman Federal Capital Territory, AUPCTRE, Aliyu Maradun who addressed the media at about 7 am said the management of SON should stop all acts of intimidation and victimisation of members of staff. Besides, Maradun said the management must reverse what he described  all punitive transfers effected since “management’s onslaught on the union after the headquarters branch election.” SON, Mr Dipo Fashina when contacted said that the issues being raised by the workers were being addressed by the management. For instance, on the issue of promotion arrears, he said that budgetary allocation had been made adding that the amount provided had already been approved in the 2019 budget by the National Assembly.
