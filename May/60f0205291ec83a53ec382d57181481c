Nigerian Air Force (NAF) yesterday said at least 20 suspected bandits were killed in air operations in Zamfara State. The Director of Public Relations and Information (DOPRI), Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, who made the disclosure in a statement, said structures, fuel storage containers, arms, explosives and other logistics supplies, were also destroyed.  According to Daramola, the suspected bandits killed, were fighters of major kingpin, Alhaji Lawal. The DOPRI disclosed that the kingpin had operated in Rugu Forest of the state, where the operation was undertaken.  He said: “The Air Task Force (ATF) for Operation Diran Mikiya has recorded a major success against bandits in Zamfara State by destroying the camp of a major kingpin, Alhaji Lawal, and neutralising up to 20 of his fighters near Rugu Forest in Zamfara State.  “This was accomplished in a dawn attack executed on 26 April 2019 after credible intelligence indicated that the notorious kingpin was camped, along with dozens of his fighters, at a settlement about four kilometres west of Rugu Forest, where he keeps his logistics supplies, coordinates operations and launches attacks against security forces as well as innocent civilians.  “Consequently, following detailed confirmatory Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions, the ATF dispatched one Alpha Jet and an attack helicopter to strike the camp. “No fewer than 20 bandits were neutralised in the air strikes. The attached video clip, now declassified, shows parts of the attack which may be viewed by the general public.”  Daramola said the Alpha Jet strikes recorded direct hits on the camp destroying the bandits’ structures, fuel storage containers, arms, explosives and other logistics supplies, which were seen engulfed in flames.
