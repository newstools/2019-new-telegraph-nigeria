Despite criticisms in some quarters over the person of President Muhammadu Buhari and the incumbent All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration, there are still those, who are core loyalists of the President and his party. Recently a former deputy governor took her loyalty for Buhari too far by going to the Holy Land, Saudi Arabia, to specifically pray for the President and the success of the incumbent administration. The ex-deputy governor who spoke in her local language told Politricks that “I just returned from Saudi Arabia, where I went to specifically pray for President Buhari and Nigeria. I really prayed for him and the success of the present administration. The President is doing a lot in his fight against corruption and his effort to sanitise the country will be fruitful.” The former second citizen was so passionate of Buhari to the extent that she almost placed a curse on those against the President’s ongoing anti-corruption war and leadership style.
