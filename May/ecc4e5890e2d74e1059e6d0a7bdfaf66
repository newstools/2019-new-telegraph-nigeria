Ogun State Governorelect, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has presented a bus to Deputy Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Hon. Olakunle Oluomo. The bus is to be deployed as free school shuttle and replacement for one of the deputy speaker’s five vehicles burnt by suspected hoodlums a few weeks ago in Ifo. Oluomo, representing Ifo I state constituency, made this known at the weekend during commissioning of the newly donated “Navistar American Model School Bus.”  Suspected hoodlums had on 21st April, 2019 razed the vehicles and constituency offices of Oluomo, and a lawmaker representing Ifo/Ewekoro Federal Constituency, Ibrahim Isiaka after a team of police officers reportedly opened fire at a bus stop in Iyana Coker area of Ifo, killing a 25-year-old Akeem Akinsanya.  The deputy speaker, however, appreciated the governor-elect’s kind gesture, saying the bus gift had brought back smiles to faces of students in Ifo area. According to him, the bus would revive the free school bus programme in his constituency. Oluomo expressed gratitude to everyone who sympathised with him when five buses deployed for students’ shuttle were burnt.  He said: “I, on behalf of my constituents, thank the most compassionate political leader I have ever met, the Ogun State Governorelect, Prince Dapo Abiodun, for bringing back smiles to the faces of students in Ifo by personally donating a very big bus to me.  “This kind gesture is to revive my free school bus programme that has stopped since the old buses were burnt by enemies of progress on Sunday, 21st April, 2019.
