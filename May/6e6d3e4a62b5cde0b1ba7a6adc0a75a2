Music sensation, Runtown, is set to engineer what promises to be another lap of an unprecedented run with his second project dubbed, Tradition.
Runtown announced the new EP through an evocative experiential guide that was published through his official website. The project which will be released on May 31 is a follow-up to his 2015 debut album, Ghetto University, which was released to world acclaim.
Tradition is a six-track project that houses five new songs and one already released single, Unleash, which serves as a bonus track. Unleash which features south-east London artiste, Fekky, was released in June 2018 and is the only song that accommodates a guest contribution.
The singer also revealed that a week before the project is launched, he would be releasing a new single titled ‘Emotion’ which is the second track on the extended play.
