 Super Falcons coach, Thomas Dennerby, has released a list of 27 players for the final camping exercise ahead of the 8th FIFA Women’s World Cup scheduled to take place in France between June 7 and July 7. Dennerby currently with the team in Cote d’Ivoire for the ongoing West Africa Football Union B Cup, has kept faith with bulk of the players he has been using since after the Africa Women Cup of Nations, especially those who took part at some of the recent friendly games – China Tournament in Meizhou, in January, Cyprus Women’s Cup in February, and two other matches in Spain, including a high-profile clash with the Canada Women national team. Defensive bulwark Onome Ebi, midfield lubricator Ngozi Okobi and power forward Desire Oparanozie top the list of 27 players that also include former Africa Women Footballer of the year, Asisat Oshoala. Goalkeeper Tochukwu Oluehi, defenders Josephine Chukwunonye, Osinachi Ohale and Ngozi Ebere, midfielders Rita Chikwelu and Halimatu Ayinde and forward Francisca Ordega, who all played key roles in the Super Falcons’ ninth continental triumph in Ghana late last year, were also included. Dennerby has also picked Uchenna Kanu, who has shown tremendous firepower at the ongoing WAFU Women’s Cup in Abidjan with eight goals in two matches, as well as home –based professionals Amarachi Okoronkwo, Evelyn Nwabuoku, Chidinma Okeke and Chiamaka Nnadozie. Nigeria’s final list of 23 players for the 8th FIFA Women’s World Cup finals will emerge from this group of 27, with four players to be removed towards the end of the two-week camping in Austria. NFF’s Head of Women Football, Ruth David, told thenff.com on Monday that the African champions would depart from Abuja for Austria on Monday, May 20 for the Avita Resort in Bad Tatzmannsdorf – the same facility where the Super Eagles had their final camping programme just before the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. The Super Falcons will depart Austria on June 4 direct to Reims, where they open their World Cup campaign against Norway on June 8.
