Senior Nigerian government officials and key investors have endorsed the African Development Bank’s (AfDB’s) Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (SAPZ) initiative, describing it as a pathway to Africa’s agricultural revolution. This was contained in a statement made available to New Telegraph in Lagos yesterday. SAPZs are designed to concentrate agro-processing activities within areas of high agricultural potential in order to increase productivity and competitiveness. The initiative will provide millions of youth and rural men and women with employment and entrepreneurship opportunities. Speaking at an investment forum held at the Bank’s office in Abuja, Nigeria’s Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Audu Ogbeh, said the country was eager to work with the Bank to develop SAPZs. “I can’t thank the African Development Bank and all the investors gathered here today enough,” he said. “We need to make agriculture work again. It is with initiatives like this that we can truly create wealth and employment for our teeming youth population. The investment forum was an opportunity to secure the commitment of key agribusiness companies and banks in the planning, investment and implementation of priority SAPZs in Nigeria.
