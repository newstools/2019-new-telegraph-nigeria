Tiwa Savage is no longer a member of MAVIN, a record label owned by Micheal Ajereh Collins, better known as Don Jazzy. The ‘Lova Lova’ singer has signed a new deal with Universal Music Group, an American music company that boasts of artistes like Rihanna, Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga. The artiste recently deleted all the pictures on her Instagram page and shared a picture of her and Lucian Grainge on Thursday morning. In a farewell message on his Instagram handle, Don Jazzy said no one else will occupy her position as the first lady of Mavin. “Our darling Tiwatope. We at Mavin would like to say a very big thank you for being such an inspiration to all of us, a friend, a sister. “It’s been an epic journey with you and we are very proud of what we have achieved together. As you start this new chapter in your life we want you to know that we are solidly behind you and can’t wait for the world to see what we have always believed you can be. “Your jersey as the first lady of Mavin will forever be yours as we do not intend to fill that position with anyone else. We love you from the bottom of our hearts and pray God’s blessings continue to follow you.”
