Ogun State Governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun yesterday inaugurated a new security outfit to combat crimes and strengthen the state’s existing security architecture. Amosun said the establishment of the agency, Ogun State Community Social Orientation and Safety Corps (So-Safe Corps) followed due process as it had come to stay as a result of extant. The outfit was called Vigilante Service of Ogun State before the House of Assembly changed its name and the governor subsequently signed the establishment bill into law. At inauguration held in Abeokuta, the governor, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Taiwo Adeoluwa enthused that the state had witnessed improved security under his administration. He said: “When we came in 2011, one of the biggest challenges that confronted our state at that time was security. The security situation was so bad; that was when the entire banking infrastructure in Ogun East was not functioning.
“Our people in the area had to go to Ondo State and Abeokuta to do banking activities on account of the activities of men of the underworld. “We will be leaving office in 15 days; we are able to tell our creator and our people that in security and various sectors, we will be leaving Ogun State far better than we met it.” “We are a law-abiding government. We subscribe to the rule of law. We went the whole hog of ensuring that both the establishment and change in name pass through the Ogun State House of Assembly. “With every privilege comes responsibility. Government has stood by you and it is also important that you continue to justify the confidence that government has reposed in you. “I assure you that no administration, whether outgoing or incoming, will be able to toy with security. So, there can be no issue about your existence, particularly when it is backed by extant law and legislation.”
