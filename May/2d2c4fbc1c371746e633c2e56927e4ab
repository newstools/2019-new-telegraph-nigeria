The Nigerian Army has threatened to report a member of the Presidential Committee on North East Initiative (PCNI), Dr Sidi Ali Mohammed, to “the appropriate authorities”.  The Army said the move would enable Mohammed “to further substantiate” the claim that each of the soldiers prosecuting the counter-insurgency war in the North East, received N1, 000 daily, as opposed to Boko Haram fighters, who are paid $3,000. Acting Director, Army Public Relations (DAPR), Col. Sagir Musa, made the disclosure in a statement.  He said:”…we are call-  ing on all Nigerians to discountenance the statement credited to Dr Sidi Ali Mohammed, while we take necessary steps to formally report him to the appropriate authorities to further substantiate these unfounded allegations.  “We would like to assure the public that the Nigerian Army would remain resolute and focused in the fight against terrorism and insurgency in our great nation and no amount of distraction or terrorists’ propaganda will dissuade it”, Musa said. He further noted that the statement credited to the PCNI member, had the potential of demoralising fighting troops.  “The attention of the Nigerian Army has been drawn to a publication on Sahara Reporters and other social media platforms, to a false claim credited to one Doctor Sidi Ali Mohammed, a member of the Presidential Committee on the North East Initiative. “In it, he alleged that the criminal terrorist group members earn as much as $3,000 daily, as against the Nigerian soldier who is paid N1,000 only.  This is not true, pure lie and highly irresponsible comment coming from a supposedly knowledgeable person of his calibre. “It is also criminal and preposterous to compare the gallant soldiers of our Armed Forces with the rag tag terrorists’ criminal gang.
