Chris Ugwu writes that Regency Alliance Insurance Plc., like its peers, has continued to witness pressure on its earnings following increasing claims and underwriting expenses  Contrary to expectations that the Nigerian Insurance Industry would be the next growth sector, the performance of the industry, despite the considerable improvement, remains far below optimal. Nigerian insurers face the same challenges as their counterparts in other emerging markets. As a developing country, the challenges for Nigerian insurance companies include enforceability of insurance regulations. Expectedly, the success of Nigeria’s insurance industry will depend largely on the resolution of the identified challenges, especially the enforcement of compulsory insurance. Other key success factors are prompt claim settlement, competent management and corporate governance, innovative products, human capital and technology. Since the crash of the nation’s capital market in 2008, negative perception has trailed the sub-sector, which was compounded by inability of about 85 per cent of the companies in the industry to pay dividend to shareholders for years. Market watchers attributed the inability of the sub-sector to rise above the nominal level to crisis of confidence, since according to them, the few ones that raised high expectation for good results ended up posting negative financial results.
Regency Alliance got its fair share of the dwindling fortune of the sub-sector as the movement of its share price has remained below 50 kobo courtesy of the price methodology that was implemented early last year. The insurance firm’s price trend reflects the spike in values observed in 2007 and into the early part of 2008 as post-consolidation and speculative trade pushed prices upwards. However, the extensive economic crisis has seen the company, alongside other insurance participants, badly beaten and a downward movement mirroring the market has been the fate of Regency Alliance that the share price has dropped to a paltry 20 kobo. The insurance firm ended the year 2018 and first quarter of 2019 with low numbers as operating and claims expenses absorbed most of its revenues, leaving the company with low profit margins. The rising claims experienced in the recent times by the company, like its peers, has upstaged the rate of growth in premium, a development industry watchers said was threatening the profitability of the company and the industry as a whole. The share price, which closed at 26 kobo per share in June, 2018, declined by 20 per cent or five kobo in value that when the closing bell rang on Friday, the company’s share price stood at 20 kobo year-to-date.

He said that the company also intended to increase its market penetration through the deployment of an e-commerce platform. “We will always be guided by our corporate ideals and values of professionalism, integrity, commitment and efficiency as we create wealth for all our stakeholders while mitigating all associated risks that may arise,” he said. Kingibe added that the company also intends to increase its market penetration through the deployment of an e-commerce platform. “I want to assure that Regency Alliance Insurance Plc. is here for the long haul. We have strong confidence that the dampened socio-economic climate is temporary and Nigeria remains a land of immense opportunities and prospects. Your company is positioned to make the best of the brighter future ahead. We will always be guided by our corporate ideals and values of Professionalism, Integrity, Commitment and Efficiency as we create wealth for all our stakeholders while mitigating all associated risks that may arise,” he said.   Last line Effective risk management, alongside a tailored product offering, are vital to bringing more Nigerians into the market and boost insurance, but unless more focus is given to training new actuaries, insurance firms will continue to bear the brunt of the massive slow-down in economic activity as revenue from premium income drops significantly.
