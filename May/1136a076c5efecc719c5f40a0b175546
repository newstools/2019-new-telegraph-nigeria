Ogun State Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Chief Jide Ojuko, has resigned his appointment in the administration of Governor Ibikunle Amosun. The resignation, New Telegraph gathered was not unconnected with the unfolding crisis over installation of monarchs in some towns in Ota. Ojuko, who hails from Ota, conveyed his resignation in a letter dated 14th May, 2019, which was obtained by our correspondent yesterday. The former commissioner said he could become an outcast among his people if he continued under Amosun government. According to him, the recent directive by the governor on the issue of Obaship in some areas in Ota State Constituency was against his conscience as well as the wishes and yearnings of his people. Ojuko, however, said despite his resignation, the governor remained his political leader and brother. His letter partly reads: â€œIt pained me from the bottom of my heart to give a notice of my resignation to a boss I love so much.
