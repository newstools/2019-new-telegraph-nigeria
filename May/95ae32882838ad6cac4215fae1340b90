Flying Eagles Head Coach, Paul Aigbogun, has stated that his World Cup bound team have learnt some vital lessons in their 2-1 loss to Saudi Arabia in a friendly in Vienna, Austria on Sunday. “We were unlucky to have lost against the Saudis. We created a lot of chances but failed to put them away. Our focus will shift to conversion of opportunities because we want to make an impact at the FIFA World Cup. “There are a few other areas that myself and my assistants noticed and we will work hard at these when we get back to our training camp in Germany.” A second string side put out by Aigbogun were edged by their fellow Poland bound team in a game of few clear –cut chances. After a goalless first half, Saudi Arabia midfielder Khalid Al-Ghannam put the Asians ahead in the 56th minute beating goalkeeper Detan Ogundare with a low shot but it was cancelled out by Henry Offia nine minutes later. The Asians however have the final say as Hamed Al-Ghamdi netted the winner with 12 minutes to regulation time. The seven –time African champions and two –time FIFA World Cup runners – up have headed back to their base in Bad Goegging Munich, Germany to continue preparation for the FIFA U20 World Cup that starts on 23rd May in Poland. The team will have further test games against German clubs TSG Hoffenheim and Red Bull Leipzig, as well as Austrian club Red Bull Salzburg, before heading to the Polish city of Tychy where they play Qatar in their opening match of the competition on May 24.
