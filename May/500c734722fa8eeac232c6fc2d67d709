Former football star, John Fashanu, has come to the defense of embattled Nigerian forward Kelechi Iheanacho following the youngster’s big miss in Leicester’s 1-0 loss to Manchester City in a decisive Premier League match on Monday night. Ihenancho has endured a frustrating season with the Foxes as he has fallen out of pecking order at the King Power Stadium. But he was given a golden chance to reestablish himself at the penultimate round at the Etihad as manager Brendan Rodgers introduced him to play. And with City holding a 1-0 lead courtesy of Vincent Kompany’s screamer for Pep Guardiola’s side, the former FIFA U-17 Golden Ball winner had a one-on-one chance against the hosts’ goalkeeper Ederson but he fluffed the chance. The magnitude of the miss has generated lots of debates especially with the view that the 21-year-old was on the payroll of Man City before his move to Leicester which has fuelled insinuations in some quarters that he intentionally waste the chance to save the Citizens from losing the title as anything short of full points will see them go into the final day behind Liverpool but Fashanu who played for Wimbledon in the English top flight says Iheanacho was just unlucky not to have scored. “He was well placed to score, it was a golden chance but he missed it and I think he was just unlucky not to have the right connection with the ball because it was well placed for him as a left-footer,” he told New Telegraph. He added: “He is a professional and I don’t think that argument that he was a former Man City player made him to miss deliberately. I’m so sorry for the young chap because he is now the talking point of that crucial match. Definitely he is frustrated. Things are just not working for him.” Iheanacho’s place in Nigeria’s team to the forthcoming AFCON in Egypt is not guaranteed as he was overlooked by Nigeria’s manager Gernot Rohr in the matches against Seychelles and Egypt in March.
