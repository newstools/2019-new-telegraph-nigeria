Former Super Eagles midfielder, Mutiu Adepoju, has told national team players getting set for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations to work hard in order to ensure they emerge champions for the fourth time. Adepoju, who was a member of Nigeria’s winning team at Tunisia ’94 AFCON, admitted that the continental soccer showpiece was a major championship that other teams will also love to win, but stressed that the Eagles could become four-time champions through hard work. The former Shooting Stars Football Club of Ibadan and Real Sociedad of Spain legend said the Eagles could only realise their ambitions through hard work. He noted further that no team goes into any competition without a desire to emerge champions, but concluded that victory would go only to the side that put in the best of their preparations and abilities. Adepoju stressed: “The idea of going in for the Nations Cup should be the same with that mindset that is all about winning any championship you enter for. “The Nations Cup is a major championship we have in Africa. Every player will love to win it but they have to work for it to win.”
