Super Eagles defender, William Troost-Ekong, has said the national team has what it takes to confront top sides like Egypt, Cameroon and Senegal at the Africa Nations Cup next month.
Troost-Ekong said the Super Eagles could replicate the performance of the late Stephen Keshi -tutored side that won the tournament in South Africa in 2013.
Asked if Nigeria would play to avoid either Egypt or Cameroon at the early stage of the competition, the defender replied that they would not be afraid of any big team.
“Cameroon, Senegal, Egypt or Algeria cannot be a stumbling block,” he told ESPN.
“We have faced some of them before and if you go there and you say you want to try and win it, inevitably you have to confront one or two of those along the way, and I think now we have a squad to also deal with those kind of teams so, we will see.”
“I am quite bold in saying that we should go there to try and win it.”
“We have so much quality in our team and if everyone performs up to what they can play, I think we have shown that we can beat the top teams in Africa.”
“Having gone to the World Cup [in Russia] was a good start and seeing that we had not been to AFCON since 2013, it was good for us to go to Egypt, have good outing and see if we can emulate what those guys did in 2013.”
