A 21-year-old woman, Rahina Muhammad, on Thursday dragged her former husband, Sani Hassan and his new wife Hauwa’u, before a Sharia Court l, sitting in Magajin Gari, Kaduna, for calling her a commercial sex worker. The complainant, who resides on Zaria road area of Kaduna, told the court that Hassan has continued to call her on phone, to insult and call her names. “Whenever he calls me, he will curse me, saying no man will marry me.  I have reported him to our elders to caution him about his utterances but to no avail”, she said. Muhammad added that Sani’s new wife also calls to insult her. She prayed the court to intervene in the matter and get her justice. In their defence, the two defendants denied the claim, saying they were untrue. The judge, Malam Dahiru Lawal, after listening to both parties asked the complainant to produce witnesses. The Judge remanded them in prison, pending when a reliable surety comes for their bail. He adjourned the case until May 9 for further hearing. (NAN)
