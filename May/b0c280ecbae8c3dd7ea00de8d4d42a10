English Premier League side Everton has reportedly accepted a £25M bid with Bayern Munich over the transfer of Nigerian star Henry Onyekuru. Onyekuru joined Everton two seasons ago from Eupen but was immediately loaned to Belgium side Anderlecht where injury cut short his run. Onyekuru’s potential move to Bayern is coming after the depatures of club legends Arjen Robben and Frank Ribery. The duo who have played their last matches for the Champions over the weekend are set to be replaced by Henry Onyekuru and Manchester City’s Leroy Sane. At the start of the season he shunned offers from other clubs to join Galatasaray on loan and it proved to be a masterstroke as he got the games he needed to aid his growth and also scored vital goals to lead them to the title. His fine form has however made Everton to demand for a fee in the region of £25m from Bayern Munich for his signature.
