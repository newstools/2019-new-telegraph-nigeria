Gunmen who attacked the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA) at Dankade village, Birnin-Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State on Sunday and abducted 15 persons have demanded N15 million to free their hostages.
They abducted the pastor, Rev. Zachariya Ido, his daughter and 13 other members of the church.
This is as the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Yakubu Abubakar Sabo, said that a manhunt for the suspects was ongoing.
Sabo said the police were also not aware of any contact for ransom.
But the kidnapped pastor’s younger brother, Rev Ishaya Ado, told journalists in Kaduna that the kidnappers were asking for N15 million for the release of the pastor and the choristers.
It was learnt that the kidnappers had initially asked for N30 million on Tuesday but later reduced it to N15 million.
However, when contacted, Sabo said the operation to rescue the kidnapped persons was on course.
He said: “The operation is still ongoing, the men who were deployed to that area are still there in the forest; that is the anti-kidnapping unit of the Kaduna State Police Command and the IRT members that are giving technical assistance and support. Also, the area commander in charge of Birnin Gwari is the one coordinating the operation.”
The PPRO, however, denied knowledge of the ransom demanded by the kidnappers.
He said: “Kidnapping is mostly for ransom, so even if they have not established contact, may be soon they will do that. But for us, we are doing what is our mandate to ensure that the victims are rescued and the suspects apprehended.
“I am not aware that any demand has been made. But I will get in touch with the area command and whatever it is I will get back to you.”
