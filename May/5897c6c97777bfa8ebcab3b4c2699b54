Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, yesterday approved the appointment of 14 Permanent Secretaries for the state public service, as part of moves to strengthen the ongoing reforms aimed at deepening sustainable development of the state. The Head of Service (HoS) of the state, Isaac Ehiozuwa, in a statement, noted that the swearing-in ceremony of the Permanent Secretaries would hold on Thursday at the Banquet Hall, Government House, Benin, the state capital. Meanwhile, the state government, through the job creation and skills development platform, EdoJobs, has concluded the training of no fewer than 60 young trainees at Etsako West, Owan East and Owan West Local Government Areas. Apart from the training, the state government would provide financial assistance to the “non-banking population” in the rural communities of the state. Speaking at one of the sessions, an official of Edo- Jobs, Mr. Sam Omomoh, said the state was committed to expanding economic opportunities for residents in rural areas through various empowerment schemes for which the government is providing the beneficiaries of the training start-up capital. He said the ‘First Monie Empowerment Scheme’ in Etsako West, Owan East and Owan West LGAs would groom a new crop of mobile money agents to provide banking services to the people and save them the hassles of making grueling trips to banks in faraway towns. Omomoh added that through the money agents, the rural dwellers would have easy access to financial transactions, which include cash transfers, withdrawals and other cashless services at their convenience.
