The ex-governor, who also congratulated Mr Sanwo-Olu,  said that the new Governor deserves to enjoy his historic day without having him share in the glory with him. This,  he said was the main reason why he did not attend the formal inauguration of Sanwo-Olu and his deputy, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, insisting that the duo should be allowed to be the star of his inauguration. Ambode said in a short statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Habib Aruna, said that he had had quality private moment with his successor before handing over. He said: “I have already formally handed over reigns of power in the State to the new Governor in a most cordial and convivial ceremony at the State House yesterday. The formal inauguration should have Mr. Sanwo-Olu as the star of the day. I don’t think that glory should be shared with him by my presence. Assuring confidence in the new governor,  Ambode said that his successor deliver, calling for the prayers, cooperation and collective support of all Lagosians. He said  the new government will succeed in the excellent tradition of progressive governance .
