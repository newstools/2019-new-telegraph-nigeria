 About 60 people escaped death yesterday when a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in which they were travelling suddenly burst into flames on the Third Mainland Bridge.
It was learnt that the passengers quickly disembarked from the bus while others jumped out through the window to escape being burnt. Many of the passengers nearly fell into the lagoon while others almost ran into oncoming vehicles while running into safety.
Although the cause of the fire could not be ascertained at press time, passengers said the bus developed a mechanical fault before going up in flames.
Some of the passengers, particularly the males, were trying to assist the driver to put out the fire but others were too scared and were more concerned about their safety.
The incident caused gridlock as some motorists slowed down to catch a glimpse of the burning bus while others stopped to assist the stranded passengers.
The General Manager, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Mr. Adeshina Tiamiyu, said that no life was lost in the accident.
Tiamiyu said rescuers, comprising of good Samaritans and emergency responders, were able to contain the situation.
He said: “The information gathered at the scene of the incident revealed that a blue BRT bus, with an unknown registration number, had an electrical fault which resulted to it getting completely burnt. Fortunately, no casualty was involved in the incident.”
Tiamiyu said that the fire was completely put out by men of state Fire Service from Alausa station while “the forklift and low-bed of the agency” evacuated the wreckage of the bus.
