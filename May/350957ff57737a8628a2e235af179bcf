 As reactions continue to trail the decline in the nation’s Q1 2019 Gross Domestic Product (GDP). analysts at Cowry Asset Management Limited have predicted an increase in the country’s production output in the coming months.
The experts stated this in the firm’s latest weekly financial markets review and outlook obtained by New Telegraph. According to the report released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) last week, Nigeria’s real GDP grew 2.01per cent to N16.42 trillion in Q1 2019, which was slower than the 2.38per cent ( N19.04 trillion) registered in Q4 2018. The report stated that the oil & gas sector contracted y-o-y by 2.40per cent to N1.50 trillion in Q1 2019 (a reversal from the 14.02% rise in Q1 2018), adding that this was chiefly due to the drop in crude oil price in the quarter under review. However, commenting on the NBS report, the analysts said: “On the back of the Monetary Policy Committee’s (MPC) decision to hold policy rate at 13.50%, the recent move by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to cap deposit money banks’ investment in treasury bills and federal government bonds as well as the anticipated passage of the 2019 budget and implementation of the new minimum wage, we expect a boost in production output going forward.” President Muhammadu Buhari had on Monday signed the N8.9trillion 2019 budget which he had submitted to the National Assembly in December last year. The President’s original proposal of N8.83trillion was increased to N8.9trillion by the Federal lawmakers. It would be recalled that the President had in April this year signed the N30,000 National Minimum Wage Bill into law. According to the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, the payment of the N30,000 to workers would commence from April 18.
