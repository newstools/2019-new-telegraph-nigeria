A member of the House of Representatives Hon. Gudaji Kazaure (APC, Jigawa) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to reconsider the reappointment of Mr. Godwin Emefiele’s as Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Kazaure, who made the call at a press briefing yesterday, said he was a staunch supporter of President Buhari and is ready to die defending his policies. He however said that the re-appointment of the CBN boss by Buhari had shown that he may have been fed with lies by people close to him. According to Kazaure, many of the president’s supporters are disappointed with his reappointment of Emefiele’s for a second term in office. He noted that most of the corrupt politicians that are being prosecuted in law courts by the Buhari’s government are those that got large chunk of public funds released by the apex bank. The lawmaker further informed that he had held many meetings with many Buhari’s supporters and groups and they believe that some people are telling the President what is not true in terms of performance and integrity of his appointees. He said: “We believe that some people are telling the President what is not true and he believed them. Because of many things that have happened to this country, we believe that the CBN Governor should not have been re-appointed by the President”. He noted that there were many qualified Nigerians that can perform better than the present CBN Governor and added that he had tried but has not succeeded in many areas. The All Progressives Congress (APC) lawmaker pointed out that in 2014 when the CBN helmsman was first appointed to the position, he met the United States dollars exchange rate to Naira at N180/1USD but regretted that it now exchanges at N350/1USD. “We do not have confidence in Emefiele to make the dollar strong. We have good economists. In fact, people like Suleiman Barau, they brought his CV to the president but he was not considered”, he disclosed.
