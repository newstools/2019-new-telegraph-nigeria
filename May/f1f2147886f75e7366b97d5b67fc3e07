The Coalition of South-East Youth Leaders (COSEYL) has described distribution of 450,000 palm seedlings to youths by a former governor of Abia State and Senator- elect for Abia North senatorial district, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu as the first of its kind and capable of providing employment for beneficiaries and boosting food production. Kalu through the Orji Uzor Kalu (OUK) Foundation distributed 450,000 young nursery palms free of charge as part of its empowerment programme.  In a statement issued by President-General of COSEYL, Chief Goodluck Ibem and Secretary General, Comrade Kanice Igwe and made available to newsmen in Umuahia, the group “commend His Excellency Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu for flagging off 450,000 free palm seedlings program to empower the good of Abia state and  South-East zone in general.”  The group was particularly excited that the “agricultural program will boost food production and also provide massive employment for our teeming unemployed youths, men and women.”  “This Agricultural program is first of its kind. It will boost the economy of Nigeria. In the next few years, more palm oil will be available for export to other countries which will improve the balance of payment of Nigeria and enhance our foreign earnings.  “The bold Agricultural initiative by Dr Kalu will reduce ruralurban migration as more youths who might want to move to the city for white collar jobs will now stay in the village gainfully employed and making ends meet.”
