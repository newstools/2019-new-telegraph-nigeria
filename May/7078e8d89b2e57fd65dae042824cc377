Suspected internet fraudsters yesterday unleashed a ferocious dog on officials of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibadan zonal office. After being overpowered eventually, one of the suspects smashed and destroyed his I-Phone to prevent the anti-graft officials from getting access to information contained in it. The ploy, however, failed as the officials recovered the phone, now kept with the forensic unit of the commission for proper analysis of its data. Officials of the commission had stormed the suspectsâ€™ hideout at Agara area of Ibadan in the early hours of the day, but after proper introduction, one of the suspects instructed the guard to release the dog to attack the men. The trick, however, failed to work as the detectives tamed the dog and conducted a search on the apartment and effected arrest of the suspects. The operation was led by the second- in-command to the zonal head, Bright Igeleke. Those arrested are Paul Afolabi, Balogun Ibrahim Adebayo, Izu Ibobo Chukwunalu, Abe Tolulope, Onifade Gidion Idowu, Komolafe Tosin and Igwe Kinsley Otuu. Four other suspects were earlier arrested for their alleged involvement in cyber-related offences. They are Adebisi Adewale Michael, Olowolayemo Olakunle Quddus, Opaaje Oluwatobi Isiah and Itowe Kelvin Olutayo. The EFCC said the suspects were using the internet to defraud unsuspecting victims while posing online as white ladies and foreign military officers. The EFCC recovered a Lexus car, I-phones, other brands of phones and international passports.
