The Peoples Democratic Party in the South West has denies knowledge of the rumored defection plans by Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State to the party. In a statement by Zonal Publicity Secretary, Ayo Fadaka, the rumour is predicated on the recurring challenges the governor continues to encounter in the All Progressives Congress. “It will be recalled that this development is responsible for his hijack of AA as a platform which some of his candidates who were denied ticket in APC contested the last election. “We, however, wish to state most unequivocally that the PDP in Ondo State remains cohesive, solid and vibrant through dint of hard work and commitment of leaders and members of the party and as such is not primed to be taken over by anyone, irrespective of his status. “We also declare that anyone who wishes to join our party will also be welcome into our ranks provided such a person or group recognises the fact that no special privileges will be accorded him/them upon joining. Thus should Governor Akeredolu desire to join our party today, he will be welcome as a fresh member with no special privileges of any kind. “It is common knowledge that gubernatorial election holds in Ondo State next year and prominent members are already getting prepared to take a shot at becoming the party’s flag bearer, the party shall at the fullness of time organize a primary election to pick whoever will become our candidate in that election. It is important to again underscore the fact that the party will maintain the tradition of picking its candidate through a free and fair primary election that will be rancour free. “The hoopla surrounding Akeredolu’s desire to join our party remains a rumor and currently not an issue within our party. “We therefore enjoin our members in Ondo State to disregard the rumor and continue to promote and extend the frontiers of the party in their various communities.”
