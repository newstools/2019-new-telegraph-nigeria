Respite yesterday came the way of a driver, Jones Ofori aka James Ofori, as Justice Muslim Sule Hassan of a Federal High Court in Lagos ordered his immediate release from prison after spending six years in detention without trial. The court also ordered the Inspector- General of Police (IG) to pay the driver N10 million as damages for his unlawful arrest and illegal detention since 2013. Delivering judgement in a fundamental rights enforcement suit filed by Ofori through his lawyer, Adewale Fadipe, the judge noted that despite claims by the respondents that they filed counter-affidavits to the suit, there was no prove of service in the court’s file. The court also berated the respondents over their non-appearance while the matter lasted. With this development, Justice Hassan said he was left with no other option than to grant the reliefs sought by the applicant. Declaring Ofori’s arrest and detention as illegal and unlawful, Hassan ordered the Deputy-Controller of Prisons to immediately release him from detention. The Federal Government, Attorney- General of the Federation (AGF), Inspector-General of Police (IGP) and the Deputy-Controller of Prison (DCP), were joined as co-defendants in the suit. Ofori, in the suit marked FHC/L/ CS/887/18, had asked the court for a declaration that his arrest and detention for two weeks and a week at Ajiwe Police Station and Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) Ikeja respectively, was illegal and constituted an infringement on his fundamental rights to personal liberty as guaranteed by the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He sought a declaration that his continued imprisonment without trial constituted an infringement of his freedom to personal liberty as guaranteed by the constitution. Ofori also asked the court for an order directing his immediate release from prison. He further asked the court to award N50 million in his favour, for his unlawful arrest and detention.
