In commemoration of the celebration of the 55th Anniversary of its establishment, the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has conducted a medical outreach for Basa Community in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. The one-day medical outreach, catered for the medical needs of close to 4,000 persons, including men, women, children and the aged people. Medical services provided during the outreach included medical consultations, counseling and screening as well as dental care, eye treatment and deworming of children. In addition, free prescription eye glasses and medications were distributed, as well as insecticide treated mosquito nets given to over 500 families. The outreach was conducted in continuation of efforts by the NAF to enhance civil-military relations with the host Communities of NAF Bases across the country. In his remarks during the flagging-off of the event, the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, who was represented by the Chief of Medical Services (CMS), Headquarters NAF, Air Commodore Muhammad Shaibu, reiterated the readiness of the Service to intensify its effort at ensuring that host communities of NAF Bases as well as other Nigerians, who may be in need of medical interventions, are cared for at no cost to them. He recounted that the NAF had, over the last one year, conducted free medical outreaches in many states of the federation, thereby reaching out to several Nigerians who may not be privileged to get such standardized medical services. He added that the beneficiaries of the outreach should make good use of the opportunity as further treatment would be provided for patients with serious ailments at the 063 NAF Hospital, NAF Base Abuja.
