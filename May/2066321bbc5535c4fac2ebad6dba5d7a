Several people were yesterday afternoon injured when a Kanobound train derailed between Maikunkele and Jangaru in Bosso Local Government Area of Niger State. It was learnt that the accident was caused by cattle crossing the railway and the train rammed into them. The accident, according to a witness, did not affect two first class coaches joined to the engine but the canteen and the second class coaches fell off the rail track while in motion, causing it to derail. This, however, caused tension among passengers on the train who struggled to escape through the windows of the affected coaches, making many of them to be injured. The train was said to be coming from Lagos and heading to Kano before it derailed. Only five coaches were affected. But it was learnt that the train has been on the rail for three days. Some of the passengers, who were not injured, were at press time looking for vehicles to convey them to Minna to continue their journey to Kano. An ambulance from the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) convened the injured passengers to the General Hospital, Wushishi, for treatment. The NRC Public Relations Officer and other officials refused to comment on the incident or confirm the number of injured persons. Also, the Director-General (DG) of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), Ibrahim Inga, confirmed the accident. He said: “We just heard about it and we will liaise with the NRC.”
