A housewife, Mira Kaka, on Wednesday pleaded with a Jikwoyi Customary Court not to grant her husband’s prayer for divorce. Kaka made the plea on Friday when she appeared in the court following a divorce suit filed by her husband, Johnson, alleging infidelity. ”I am willing to work with my husband to save the marriage. “He is still my husband, I don’t want the marriage to be dissolved, and I don’t want him to have custody of the children”,she said. She also begged the court to order her husband to bring back her children, saying “he has taken the children away for three weeks I don’t know where my children are”,she said. Johnson, who was present in court, told the court that, he only took the children to his sister’s house for holiday, “I will bring them back this week to resume school”,he added. The Judge, Everyman Eleanya , advised Kaka, to try  and resolve the issues with her husband, if she truly wants to continue with the marriage. Justice Eleanya urged parties to explore all possible avenues for settlement. He adjourned the case until May 16, for hearing. (NAN)
