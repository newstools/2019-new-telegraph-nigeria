An Ebute Meta Chief Magistrateâ€™s Court in Lagos has ordered that two brothers, who allegedly beat a man, Mr. Chidi Ogbulike, 43 to death, be remanded in prison.  The police had charged Anasigwe Chidalu, 28, and Okwuchukwu, 34 on a two-count of conspiracy and murder. Chief Magistrate O.O. Olatunji, who did not take the plea of the defendants, ordered that they be remanded in Ikoyi Prison pending legal advice from the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Olatunji directed the police to forward a duplicate of their case file to the DPP. He adjourned the case until June 10 for legal advice.  Earlier, police prosecutor, Inspector Oladele Adebayo, told the court that the defendants allegedly committed the offences on 19th April, 2019 at 7.30 a.m. at 3, Fatai Akinyemi Street, off Agric Road, Igando. He said the defendants ganged up and beat Ogbulike to death. The offences, he said, contravened the provisions of Sections 223 and 233 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015.
