Nigeria striker, Asisat Oshoala, says she is proud with her achievement with Barcelona Femenino despite defeat to Lyon in the Women’s Champions League final.
The three-time African footballer of the year netted a late consolation for the Catalan club in their 4-1 loss to French side Lyon Feminines.
The former Liverpool and Arsenal forward came on as a late substitute to become the first African to play and score in the European Women’s Champions League final.
“This is a big achievement and I am very proud despite the defeat,” she told BBC Sport.
“To also become the first Nigerian and first Barcelona player to score in the final is something I really appreciate.
“As a female footballer this is the stuff of dreams and something you can only imagine, but I thank God and FC Barcelona for making me fulfil this.”
The 24-year-old joined the Spanish outfit on loan from Chinese champions Dalian Quanjian in January, while the league is in its off-season.
The former BBC Women’s Footballer of the Year said the move was necessary to keep in shape ahead of June’s World Cup in France.
