Married to late billionaire business man, Olorogun Michael Ibru, Cecelia has never really worn the toga of a society lady given to serious social life. However, until she went out of circulation few years back, she was neck deep in her career as a banker.  Cecelia, during her days as the CEO of defunct financial institution, Oceanic Bank, she was toast of many in the society who envied her successes in the financial sector.  Things would however turn sour for Cecilia and a few other bank chiefs when embattled Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido became Governor of the Central bank. He initiated a reform program which exposed the ills of bank chiefs among whom Cecilia was. She was tried in the court of law for corruption and was convicted. It will be recalled Cecilia spent most of her jail term at upscale medical facility, Reddington Hospital upon her health that went bad. Years after her travail that led her to be off the radar, the Delta State-born Cecelia, eventually broke her silence by finding her voice. Doing this, she took a swipe at Sanusi saying she was only being persecuted by Sanusi, alleging the latter saw her as a threat to his job as Governor of the Central Bank.  However, Ceceliaâ€™s decision to break her silence with accusation against Sanusi may have boomeranged as she has come under attacks from different quarters. While some are of the opinion that speaking up at a moment Sanusi is embattled is a calculated attempt to denigrate the Emir, others feel she has no moral justification to accuse Sanusi of persecution since she was not absolved of charges that eventually led to her conviction.
