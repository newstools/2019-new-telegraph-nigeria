Hunters Association in the South-West zone of the country has read the riot act to Fulani herdsmen who have been attacking travellers, farmers and other innocent residents to desist forthwith as they would no longer sit by and watch the unprovoked attacks. Coordinator of the hunters and President of the ‘Soludero’ Hunters Association, Dr. Nureni Ajijola Anabi gave the warning yesterday while interacting with journalists in Ibadan. While welcoming new governor of the state, Engr. Seyi Makinde on board, Anabi called on him to fully engage the hunters in curbing crimes in the state, adding that he and thousands of his members would liaise with the “Agbekoya Association” and other conventional security agencies to ensure that criminals had no hiding place in the state. He said: “I want to tell you that we have charms that can demobilize armoured tanks and rifles of all kinds.”
Weapons of insurgents will just not work. When invited, we can also give the soldiers some protection that would not make them vulnerable to attacks. “President Buhari has done tremendously well in the fight against Book Haram. Except for those who don’t want to face facts, this administration has given hope to ordinary Nigerians. The insecurity issue has been tackled though much still needs to be done. The president should just try us and see if we can help.
“We are using this medium to tell Fulani herdsmen terrorising our communities to steer clear of the South West, else they will see what they never bargained for.”
