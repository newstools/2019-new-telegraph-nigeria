West Africa Tourism Organisation(WATO) has signed a pact with World Cities Tourism Federation (WCTF). The pact, which was signed during the recently held Thematic Forum on People – to – People Connectivity of the Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation held at the Chinese National Convention Centre, Beijing, will among others see cooperation in tourism promotion between the two bodies. It is also to further advance tourism development and promotion in West and Central Africa, improve on the “Belt and Road” tourism destination cooperation, set up the friendly China-African non-governmental cooperation platform and establish the panoramic strategic partnership between the two organisations.  The cooperation framework agreement which was signed by the Secretary General of the WTCF, Mr. Song Yu and the Chief Executive Officer of WATO, Ms Ola Wright, has been placed on the outcome list of the Forum.  By this MoU, both bodies have been able to organise and establish a cooperation development mechanism based on the principle of friendly cooperation and mutual benefits in which the two parties agreed to strengthen the cooperation and communication in the tourism industry in the following fields: Cooperate to launch regional forum projects in renowned cities of West Africa; cooperate to hold tourism trade fairs; recommend renowned West African tourism cities to join WTCF; set up cooperation and communication platforms between members; cooperate to launch destination database cooperation, exchanging and sharing the relevant data of the destinations; mutually provide support for the other party’s relevant tourism meetings; provide free training for five select members, to be recommended by WATO, to attend the Training Programme on International Tourist Destination Promotion and Marketing from WTCF.  WTCF will also provide publicity services for WATO through the WTCF web-media platforms and other channels in order to improve the influence of the West African destinations in China. Wright described the forum as very fruitful as she was able to achieve quite a lot of mileage from it, including the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed with WCTF and gaining insight and inspiration from the speeches of some of the world leader, especially Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visionary speech, which she said was very inspiring.
