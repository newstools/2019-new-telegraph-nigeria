The collapsed of quay apron at the 42-year-old Tincan Island Port has impeded smooth shipping and discharging of cargoes in three terminals of the port. The affected terminals at the port are Five Star Logistics, Josepdam Port Services Limited and Tin Can Island Container Terminal (TICT). Tincan Island Port was constructed in 1977 to ease congestion at the Lagos Port Complex. It was learnt that two portions of the Five Star Logistics terminal have already caved in and washed into lagoon. Also, Josepdam Port Services (JPS) is currently facing the same challenge as a portion of its quay apron has also caved in. Its General Manager, David Iriabe, explained that the collapse occurred while one of their cranes was working around the area. He said that the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) had been contacted over the collapse. Iriabe added that the company and NPA were trying to find a lasting solution to the problem. At TICT, it was learnt that remedial work had been done on the bad portion as an alternative to comprehensive reconstruction.
