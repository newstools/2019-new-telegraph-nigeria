When the lawmaker representing Amuwo-Odofin I state constituency in Lagos State, Hon. Dipo Olorunrinu, defected from his party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC), just five weeks to the end of the Eighth Assembly, not a few people raised eyebrows on the timing of the movement.  Olorunrinu, who is the only surviving legislator of the PDP in the state Assembly, lost his re-election bid to the house to the APC and said his defection is aimed at joining fellow progressive-minded politicians.  But those close to the lawmaker said the decision to quickly jump ship from PDP to APC before the end of legislative session was borne out of fears that his severance package and entitlement may be left hanging because of his party affiliation.  If the assertion is true, then the marriage between the lawmaker and his new platform may just be cyclic.
