Suleiman Ibrahim from Abuja got a standing ovation from the over 800 spectators when he was called up as the most outstanding player in the boys events at the end of the weeklong Central Bank Junior Tennis Championship which ended in Lagos Saturday. Suleiman had lost in the boys 16 finals to defending champion, David Dawariye of Rivers, 10-4, 7-10, 10-8 but his determination and superior stroke production which saw him rally from a set down to win the second set and take the match to a close final set, clearly endeared him to the crowd.  The MOP for the girls was awarded to Omolade Aderemi from Ondo who won the girls 16 finals easily beating Omolayo Bamidele of Ekiti 10-5, 10- 1. Aderemi, who lost in the semifinals of the last junior tournament a month ago, completely turned the table this time around – beating defending champion, Rebecca Ekpenyong, in the semifinals and, now twice runner-up, Bamidele in the finals.  The tournament ended with even more exciting matches in the other age categories, especially in the boys and girls 12s. Seun Ogunsakin from Ekiti retained his boys 12 title by overcoming Lucky “Federer”: Danjuma, a very exciting player from Abuja 10-5, 10-7 while Nene Yakubu from Lagos fenced off a couple of set points in the first set to edge out Favour Amaechi from Rivers 13-11, 10-2.  Other wiiners were Serena Teluwo of Lagos who beat Salamatu Haruna of Abuja, who just moved up to the 14s, 10-5, 10-7: David Ekpenyong of Akwa Ibom who won the boys 14 by defeating Ganiyu Mubarak from Oyo 10-4, 10-2.; Arwal Jaji from Lagos who won the boys 10 by beating Yohanna Yakubu.
