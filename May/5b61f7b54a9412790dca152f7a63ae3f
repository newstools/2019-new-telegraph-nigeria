Coupon payments of FGN Sukuk, Green and Savings bonds were issued late in 2017  Although Nigeria’s total domestic debt fell by 1.16 per cent to N12.44 trillion at the end of last year from N12.59 trillion in 2017, the cost of servicing the debt increased to N1.80 trillion in 2018 from N1.46 trillion in the same period of the previous year, New Telegraph has learnt.
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) disclosed this in its: “Annual Activity Report 2018,” posted on its website yesterday. According to the apex bank, the increase in the debt servicing cost was propelled by the coupon payments of new instruments such as the Federal Government Sukuk, Green and Savings bonds, which were issued late in 2017.  CBN stated: “During the review period, total domestic debt outstanding at end-December 2018 was N12,443.13 billion, representing a decrease of N146.35 billion or 1.16 per cent when compared with N12,589.49 billion in 2017. The decline was due to the Federal Government’s preference for foreign borrowing to finance its fiscal deficit at attractive rates. The debt stock comprised FGN Bonds worth N9,134.19 billion or 73.41 per cent, FGN Saving Bonds worth N10.75 billion or 0.09 per cent, FGN Sukuk worth N200.00 billion or 1.61 per cent, FGN Green Bonds worth N10.69 billion or 0.09 per cent, FGN Special Bonds worth N200.54 billion or 1.61 per cent, and NTBs worth N2,735.97 billion or 21.99 per cent.” Besides, it said: “The outstanding Federal Republic of Nigeria (FRN) Treasury Bonds worth N150.99 billion constituted the remaining 1.21 per cent. Nevertheless, the cost of servicing the debt grew by 23.65 per cent to N1,799.74 billion, compared with N1,455.53 billion at the end of 2017. The increase in the cost of debt servicing in 2018 was attributable to the coupon payments of new instruments (such as FGN Sukuk, Green bonds and FGN Savings bonds) that were issued late in 2017.” Giving a breakdown of the cost in 2018, CBN stated: “FGN Bonds coupon payments (including special Bonds) accounted for N1,118.75 billion or 62.16 per cent, while interest on NTBs stood at N640.68 billion or 35.60 per cent, FRN Treasury Bonds was N23.84 billion or 1.32 per cent, while FGN Sukuk constituted the balance of N16.47 billion or 0.92 per cent.” CBN equally disclosed that total FGN Bonds offered to the public in 2018 was N1,070.00 billion, while public subscription and sale stood at N1,506.03 billion and N762.04 billion, respectively. Specifically, it stated that the amount offered comprised: “new issues and re-openings of FGN Bonds series 1, 2, 3 and 6. In 2017, FGN Bonds issued, subscribed and allotted were N1,490.00 billion, N2,377.38 billion and N1,520.67 billion, respectively.” According to the apex bank: “The lower subscription in 2018 was traceable, largely to a lower offer amount and preference for the euro bonds.”
