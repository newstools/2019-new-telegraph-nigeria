Gunmen yesterday invaded Plateau State Polytechnic staff quarters located at Heipang in Barki Ladi Local Government Area and abducted a relation of the Assistant Registrar of the institution. The gunmen abducted a lady identified as the younger sister of the institution’s Assistant Registrar, Mr. Ezekiel Rangs. Rangs said he was asleep with other family members, including his younger sister, Abigail, when the gunmen stormed his apartment about 12:10a.m. According to him, the bandits gained entrance into their house after they used a big stone to force the door open. He said: “We were sleeping when we heard a big bang on the door. Before we knew what was happening, the gunmen were already inside the house. When we discovered that they were armed, we pleaded for them to spare our lives but they took away my younger sister who just gained admission for National Diploma, Social Development. “When they said we should give them a phone through which we can contact them, I offered to give them my own but they refused and instead demanded my wife’s phone and departed. When the incident happened, some soldiers led by Col. Tanko came to the house within 30 minutes and we told them what happened.” Rangs added that the matter had been reported to the Divisional Police Officer in the area. Yesterday’s attack on the Plateau Polytechnic’s staff quarters was not the first. Gunmen had in February attacked the staff quarters and kidnapped Kim Dido, a 12-year-old son of the institution’s Chaplain, Rev. Andrew Dido. He was released within 24 hours after ransom was allegedly paid by the family. Meanwhile, a lawyer and human rights activist, Dalyop Solomon Mwantiri, has advised the management of the institution and the Plateau State government to complete erection of the school’s fence and permanently station Mobile Police personnel to guarantee the safety of the staff and students. However, police are yet to issue any statement on the attack.
