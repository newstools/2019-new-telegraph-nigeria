Popular Nigerian Singer, David Adeleke popularly known as Davido has come under heavy criticism by his fans for casting aspersion on the person and office of the Governor of Osun state, Gboyega Oyetola and creating unnecessary tension to heat up Osun polity, as the appeal court has reserved judgment in a case between his Uncle, Senator Ademola Adeleke and Oyetola. The Assurance crooner recently opened an instagram page specifically dedicated to the cause of persecuting Oyetola with the hash tag – #OperationOyetolamustGO.

Part of the findings of Justice O. A. Musa was that the testimonial submitted by Adeleke was collected, signed and stamped in 1988 under Ede Muslim Grammar School Osun State, 3years ahead of the creation of the State.

However, Davido was taunted by his fans and followers as he got the following deserved responses, see below; <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/img-20190503-wa00055161268839599100928.jpg?resize=518%2C1080&#038;ssl=1" class="wp-image-208066 alignnone size-full" width="518" height="1080" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/img-20190503-wa00055161268839599100928.jpg?w=518&amp;ssl=1 518w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/img-20190503-wa00055161268839599100928.jpg?resize=144%2C300&amp;ssl=1 144w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/img-20190503-wa00055161268839599100928.jpg?resize=491%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 491w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" data-recalc-dims="1"> <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/img-20190503-wa00046760444551425623254.jpg?resize=518%2C1080&#038;ssl=1" class="wp-image-208069 alignnone size-full" width="518" height="1080" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/img-20190503-wa00046760444551425623254.jpg?w=518&amp;ssl=1 518w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/img-20190503-wa00046760444551425623254.jpg?resize=144%2C300&amp;ssl=1 144w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/img-20190503-wa00046760444551425623254.jpg?resize=491%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 491w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" data-recalc-dims="1"> <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/img-20190503-wa00072469190939355798837.jpg?resize=482%2C107&#038;ssl=1" class="wp-image-208068 alignnone size-full" width="482" height="107" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/img-20190503-wa00072469190939355798837.jpg?w=482&amp;ssl=1 482w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/img-20190503-wa00072469190939355798837.jpg?resize=300%2C67&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px" data-recalc-dims="1"> <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/img-20190503-wa00065313087578221997609.jpg?resize=486%2C162&#038;ssl=1" class="wp-image-208067 alignnone size-full" width="486" height="162" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/img-20190503-wa00065313087578221997609.jpg?w=486&amp;ssl=1 486w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/img-20190503-wa00065313087578221997609.jpg?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" data-recalc-dims="1"> <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/img-20190503-wa00029200450668896953260.jpg?resize=518%2C1080&#038;ssl=1" class="wp-image-208070 alignnone size-full" width="518" height="1080" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/img-20190503-wa00029200450668896953260.jpg?w=518&amp;ssl=1 518w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/img-20190503-wa00029200450668896953260.jpg?resize=144%2C300&amp;ssl=1 144w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/img-20190503-wa00029200450668896953260.jpg?resize=491%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 491w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px" data-recalc-dims="1">
