The Athletic Federation of Nigeria is seeking for government intervention as the body continues to struggle to secure visas for the country’s athletes expected to be part of the IAAF World Relay in Yokohama, Japan, between May 12 and 13. The country’s representat ive s comprising of 10 athletes and the coaches were earlier scheduled to depart the country on Wednesday, but their inability to secure Japan visas scuttled the trip as the athletes are still stranded in Abuja with few days to the championship. Speaking with New Telegraph, the President of the AFN, Ibrahim Gusau, said it was becoming embarrassing for the country’s athletes to be facing visa problems anytime they were going for a major championship. “We are struggling so hard to get the visa and this is a major tournament for us as a country,” he said. “The president of Athletics South Africa, Aleck Skhosana, is on his way to Japan with 34 athletes and we are struggling to get visa for 10 athletes and their coaches. “It’s embarrassing and I want the Federal Government to come to our aid because this people are taking us for granted in this country. “Their citizen doesn’t face such problems coming to our country and this is not about Japan alone, we experienced same when we want to go for World Championships in London, World Junior Championships in Finland, we cannot continue to fold our arms.” Speaking further, Gusau said the AFN was hopeful of getting the visa early morning on Thursday (today), so that the team can travel later in the day for the two days journey to Japan. Nigerian athletes are billed to take part in 4x100m, 4x200m and 4x400m for women while the men will be taking part in 4x100m and 4x200m relays.
