Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State yesterday swore in three High Court Judges and a Customary Court of Appeal Judge following their recommendations by the National Judicial Council (NJC).  The Judges, who were sworn in at the EXCO Chambers of the Government House, Enugu, included Justices Chinedu Vincent Ezeugwu, Chukwunweike Anukenyi Ogbuabor, Mathew Chukwujiofo Onyejife Eluke and Nnenna Celia Madu as a Judge of the Customary Court of Appeal. Ezeugwu and Eluke until their elevation were private legal practitioners, Ogbuabor, a senior lecturer at the University of Nigeria, Enugu Campus, while Hon. Justice Madu was the Secretary, Magistrate Association of Nigeria, Enugu branch.  Swearing in the new Judges, Ugwuanyi said that the action was in compliance with Section 271 sub-section 2 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), which provided that “the appointment of a Judge of the High Court of a State shall be made by the governor acting on the recommendation of the National Judicial Council (NJC).”  The governor added that Section 281 sub-section (2) of the said Constitution also provided that the appointment of a Judge of the Customary Court of Appeal of a State shall be made by the governor acting on the recommendation of the NJC.  He, however, disclosed that the appointment of the new judges and their swearing in came as “a welcome relief to the Enugu State Judiciary and the people of the state who had for long endured the difficulties occasioned by the dearth of judges in the state”.   Ugwuanyi, who stated that approval had been given for the construction of two model customary courts for each of the 17 local government areas, pointed out that his administration had reached many milestones in its continual effort to reposition the State Judiciary for more efficient service “especially through the provision of suitable infrastructure and essential tools and equipment.”
