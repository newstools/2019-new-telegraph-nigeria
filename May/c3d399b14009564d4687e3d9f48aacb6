The Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, appears to be in trouble as the state government led by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has launched a fresh probe to check the expenses of the Emirate Council from 2013 to 2019. The move came just hours after the Kano State House of Assembly set up a committee to look into the possibility of creating four rival emirates in the state in order to whittle down Sanusi’s powers. The probe was initiated by Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission, according to a letter dated May 2, 2019 and signed by one CSP Suleiman Aliyu Gusau, the commission’s head of operations on behalf of Muhuyi Magaji, the agency’s chairman. The letter invited top emirate council officials, including Mohammad Sani Kwaru, accountant of the council, Mannir Sanusi; Chief of Staff, Danburan Mujittafa and Falakin Kano, to shed light on royal spending from 2013 to 2019. The officials were expected to honour the commission’s invitation on Thursday, May 9, 2019 at 12:00pm at the headquarters of the agency along State Road. The letter, however, said the commission had invited the aforementioned staff for alleged violation of Section 26 of its enabling law in the management of the emirate’s funds. The letter also stated that the invitation was sequel to the power conferred on it under “section 9 and 15 of Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-corruption Commission Law 2008 (as amended).”
