John Achagwa, the Chief Steward to Governor Kashim Shettima of Borno state has committed suicide at the Presidential Lodge, Government House, Maiduguri. The Chief Steward was said to have greeted his colleagues at the lodge at about 1; 44 pm on Tuesday before he climbed a tree behind the lodge and hung himself. A close associate of Late John Achagwa said the deceased has been complaining about the attitude of his daughter, saying “this girl will kill me.” He said “he came and asked me to delete someone’s number from his phone. I told him I don’t know how to delete it. He left angrily, only for me to hear that he has hung himself, after some few minutes.” Mr Achagwa who retired from the civil service about three years ago was retained by the governor due to exceptional delicacies. He was also said to have been promised to be appointed Village Head of Dille, Askira Uba local government area. Other sources at the Government House were of the opinion that the suicide may not be unconnected with the non-payment of his retirement benefit and gratuity, as he has been expecting that he will be given his gratuity before the end of Shettima tenure. When our correspondent visited the Government House, people were seen trooping to the Presidential Lodge where security operatives and that of the Fire service were seen trying to bring down the corpses from the tree top at about 2:37 pm.
