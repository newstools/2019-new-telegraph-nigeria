Students of the Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA), Ondo State, yesterday protested the killing of their colleague on the Akure-Ilesha Road by a hitand- run driver. The victim, Israel Anuoluwapo, a year one student of Mathematics was knocked down about 1,000 metres from the gate of the university on Tuesday.  He was immediately rushed to the university Hhealth Centre from where he was transferred to the State Hospital, Akure, owing to the severity of his injuries.  He was rushed to the Trauma centre Ondo where he gave up the ghost. But yesterday, the students held a procession to mourn their departed colleague. The procession led to gridlock on the everbusy Akure-Ilesha Road. Many motorists were stranded while the protest lasted.  The procession terminated at the gate of the university where the Vice Chancellor, Prof Joseph Adeola Fuwape, and Dean of Students Affairs, Prof Gbenga Emmanuel Onibi, addressed the students. In its reaction, the university commiserated with the family of the student over the unfortunate incident and prayed that God would give them the fortitude to bear the painful loss.  The Public Relations Officer (PRO), Mr. Adebanjo Adegbenro, said the institution called for measures to curb accidents on the Akure-Ilesha Road. The university also appealed to the state command of the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) to intensify patrol on the route in order to prevent a recurrence of such incident.  Similarly, the state government promisedÂ  to start the immediate construction of speed breakers in order to check the recklessness of drivers on that road. The Commissioner for Works, Mr. Taofiq Olawale Abdulsalam, visited the scene to assess the situation for the commencement of work.
