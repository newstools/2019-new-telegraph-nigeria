Call former banker turned traditional ruler, the Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi a controversial personality and you won’t be far away from the truth as it is evident how his utterances at different times have sparked different reactions from several quarters. Until he became a traditional ruler, he was in the financial industry where he was unarguably one of the best brains that ever came out from that sector as he reached the pinnacle of his career by becoming the Governor of the Central Bank. Luckily for him, his longtime dream of becoming an Emir became possible and he was made the Emir of Kano. Meanwhile, Sanusi’s outspoken nature made him to continue to be in the news. However, going by the latest happenings, Sanusi may have been given another bitter pill to swallow by Kano State Government as his royal empire has been reduced into a smaller unit, thereby reducing his influence as a traditional ruler. As it is, the Kano Emirate that was hitherto headed by Sanusi Lamido has now been divided into five as Governor Abdulahi Ganduje has signed it into law. While the shocking news is seen as a necessity by some, others feel there is more to it than meets the eye even as its been speculated that Ganduje used the action to hit Sanusi for his unfavourable meddlesomeness in the politics of the state.
