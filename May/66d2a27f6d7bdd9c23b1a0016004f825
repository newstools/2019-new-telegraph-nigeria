…warns on FX  China’s banking and insurance regulator has said that the US escalation of trade tensions will not solve any of its problems but will create volatility in global markets and hurt the world economy. Guo Shuqing, the Head of China’s Banking and Insurance Regulator, said that higher US tariffs will have a very limited impact on China’s economy even if it raises levies to the maximum level, and would hurt the US about as much. Guo, also the People’s Bank of China’s Party Secretary, is the highest-ranking financial official so far to publicly comment on the trade war since bilateral negotiations deteriorated earlier this month. His speech warned speculators that shorting the yuan would cause them to suffer great losses. Many of China’s exports can be redirected to the domestic market as the nation shifts to a more consumption-driven economy. China will also find new overseas markets while continuing to ship many products to the US, as importers will be willing to share the tariff costs and some Chinese goods will prove difficult to replace, Guo said. The People’s Bank of China has warned that trade tensions with the US could destabilise the global economy. US restrictions on high-tech exports to China would push up the US trade deficit, and the yuan’s weakness caused by a trade war makes the US government worried about diminishing effects of higher tariffs, according to the speech. Rising prices could also cost the US its long-term advantage of low inflation. Guo said that speculators shorting the yuan will inevitably suffer from a huge loss,” adding that it is rather ridiculous that developed countries have long asked for more currency flexibility, but when the yuan’s rate become more market oriented, some of them showed fear.
