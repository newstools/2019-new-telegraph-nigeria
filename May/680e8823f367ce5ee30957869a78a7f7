A 200 Level Guidance and Counselling student of the Cross River State University of Technology (CRUTEC), Ogbe Dominic aka Pogba, has drowned in a swimming pool in Calabar. The student drowned on Friday during a “pool party” at a popular hotel known as Jacaranda Suites, located at Atimbo area of the state capital. A source, who claimed to be the victim’s colleague, said Dominic, who hailed from Obudu Local Government Area, had during a swimming competition defeated his opponent from the University of Calabar (UNICAL). But he was nowhere to be found when the rest of his colleagues were leaving the pool. He was later spotted by the Master of Ceremony (MC) who anchored the pool party. “We just finished swimming and everybody came out of the pool but we couldn’t find Pogba. We waited for a few minutes until the MC noticed him underneath the water. “All attempts to resuscitate him were in vain as he was vomiting blood, garri and groundnut from his mouth. “Dominic was later confirmed ‘Dead on Arrival (DoA)’ by doctors at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital,” one of his colleagues stated. “This is the second time a student has drowned in Jacaranda Suites’ pool. First, it was a student of UNICAL, the only son of his parents,” another source said. The proprietor of the hotel, Mr. Asuquo Cowan, told our correspondent that the hotel management reported the matter to the Airport Police Station. The CRUTECH Public Relations Officer (PRO), Onen E. Onen, refused to speak on the incident. He said: “The Acting Vice Chancellor, Prof. Akon Joshua, has not given me the mandate to speak to you on the issue.”
