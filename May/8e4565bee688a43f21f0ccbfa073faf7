The Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) has dragged the Minister of Transportation, Mr Chibuike Amaechi, to an Abuja High Court following the minister’s refusal to attend to an Freedom of Information (FOI) request to provide the details of the contracts and agreements signed between the Federal Government of Nigeria and China for loans related to the construction of railways in Nigeria. The CSJ, had in a letter dated March 21, 2019 requested the Honourable Minister , to avail it with copies of the signed contract agreements; documentation evidencing the exact railway routes being funded by the loans; . documentation evidencing the sums borrowed by Nigeria, the terms of the borrowing; interest rate, repayment details including any moratorium or amortization period as well as penalties and sanction in the event of Nigeria’s default. The civil society organisation also requested to have the Federal Government of Nigeria’s repayment plans and the costbenefit- analysis backing the debt transaction. The resort to legal action came after the expiration of the seven (7) days provided by the FOI Act for the Honourable Minster to respond without the Honourable Minister providing the information. In the suit filed at the Federal High Court Abuja in Suit Number: FHC/ ABJ/CS/441/2019, the Centre for Social Justice sought for the following reliefs: “A declaration that denying the Applicant access to information on the Contracts/Agreements signed between the Governments and or Agencies of Nigeria and China for loans related to the construction of railways in Nigeria without explanation constitutes an infringement of the Applicant’s right guaranteed and protected by section 1 (1) of the Freedom of Information Act 2011. “A declaration that the continued refusal of the Respondent to grant to the Applicant access to the access to information on the Contracts/Agree-ments signed between the Governments and or agencies of Nigeria and China for loans related to the construction of railways in Nigeria despite Applicant’s demand violates Section 4 of the Freedom of Information Act, 2011. “A declaration that the continued refusal of the Respondent to grant access to the Applicant information on the Contracts/Agreements signed between the Governments and or Agencies of Nigeria and China for loans related to the construction of railways in Nigeria without explanation constitutes an infringement of the Applicant’s right guaranteed and protected by Section 48 of the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007” It is also seeking an order of mandamus compelling the Respondent to grant to the Applicant access to information on the Contracts/Agreements signed between the Governments and or Agencies of Nigeria and China for loans related to the construction of railways in Nigeria specifically for the following information. It also demanded an order compelling the Respondent to pay to the Applicant the Sum of N1, 000, 000 (One Million Naira) as damages for denying Applicant access to information. The reliefs are anchored on Section 4 of the Freedom of Information Act which sets the time line of 7days for public institution to accede to the request for information while Section 20 prescribes that applications for judicial review should be filed within 30 days after the public institution denies or is deemed to have denied the application or within such further time as the Court may either before or after the expiration of 30 days fix or allow. “The Freedom of Information Act in Section 1 entitles all Nigerians to a right to access to records in the custody or possession of any public official, agency or institution however described and grants a right of access to the courts for the enforcement of this right. An applicant under the Act need not demonstrate any specific interest in the information being applied for.”
