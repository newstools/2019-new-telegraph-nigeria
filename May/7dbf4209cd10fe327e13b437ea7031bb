Ex-international, Celestine Babayaro, has said Super Eagles Coach Gernot Rohr is right to recall Mikel Obi to the team ahead of the forthcoming African Cup of Nations in Egypt next month.
Mikel missed all the qualifying games for the tournament and has not featured for the Super Eagles since Russia 2018 World Cup.
However, Rohr included the experienced midfielder in his 25-man provisional squad to begin camping in Asaba, Delta State for the tournament.
Rohr had insisted that the addition of his captain was strategic towards a successful outing for the team.
Babayaro, who played a big role as Nigeria won the Atlanta 1996 Olympics gold medal in football, said there was no problems with Mikel’s return to the national team as long as the midfielder is in good form.
“Mikel has done well for the national team and the man is an experienced midfield player. He did not do badly at the end of the English Championship in which his team Middlesbrough missed promotion to the English Premier League by the whiskers,” he said
Erstwhile Super Eagles coach, Jo Bonfrere, had criticised the inclusion of Mikel who last played for the Super Eagles on June 26, 2018 in the 2-1 loss to Argentina at Russia 2018 World Cup.
“I really don’t understand the reason he (Mikel) was invited but as coach, I won’t invite a player who is not injured and chose not to be part of the qualifiers,” the 72-year-old Bonfrere who guided Nigeria to a historic Soccer Gold medal at the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Football Tournament was quoted as saying.
But speaking with newsmen, Rohr, a former Bayern Munich defender, was adamant over his choices.
“Mikel is very fit and motivated and his experience and talent can help us,” Rohr said.
