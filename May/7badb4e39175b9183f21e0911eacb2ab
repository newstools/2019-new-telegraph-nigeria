Bayelsa State Governor, Henry Seriake Dickson wants the chairmanship of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum (NGF) to rotate between the North and the South. The 36 state governors are expected to meet this evening in Abuja to elect a successor to Governor Abdulazeez Yari òf Zamfara State who is serving out his tenure on May 29. Dickson, who is Chairman of the South South Governors Forum, said the next NGF chairman should come from the south. Governors Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State and Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State, are believed to be vying for the vacant position. The Bayelsa governor, in a statement by Special Adviser, Media Relations, Mr. Fidelis Soriwe, called on his colleagues to adhere to the principle of rotation in the election of a new leader for the forum. “The decision on who should be the next Chairman of the Forum should be guided by the time tested principle of rotation between the North and South,” Dickson said. The governor said that the next Chairman of the NGF should come from the South with the end of tenure of Zamfara governor. He however, said governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDPg would not contest the position in consonance with the precedence that the NGF Chairman should be a ranking governor from the ruling political party. “I am calling on the governors who would assemble today to take a decision on the chairmanship òf the Governor’s Forum to be guided by the time tested principle of rotation between the North and the South. “Now that the Alhaji Abdulazeez Yari, Governor of Zamfara State would be ending his tenure, we expect that the next chairman should come from the South. “The precedence is that the ruling party produces the Chairman. The PDP governors have no desire to be disruptive and expect that a ranking governor from the APC, the party with the majority would be the next chairman,” Dickson said.
