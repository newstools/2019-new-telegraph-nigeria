Lassa fever has claimed two children in Kebbi State while a medical doctor, C. Jika, was infected with the disease. A medical doctor, who did want his name mentioned, told our correspondent at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Birnin-Kebbi, said that two children died last week as a result of Lassa. The doctor added that Jika, who was treating the patients, was also affected. He said: “Now the management of the FMC has opened a special unit called ‘Isolated Unit’ for the Lassa fever patients. We still have some patients inside. Also, a medical doctor, who was managing some patients last month, has also been infected and is on admission.” It was learnt that one of the children who died on Monday was a three-year-old baby. The baby died after the confirmation of the blood test from Lagos. Confirming the incident, the Commissioner for Health, Alhaji Umar Kambaza, said he was aware of the cases but government was working to contain it.
