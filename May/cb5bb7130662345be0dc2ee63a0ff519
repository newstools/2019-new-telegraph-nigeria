Super Eagles’ goalkeepers’ trainer, Alloy Agu has refuted speculation that the Nigerian national team is complacent heading into the Africa Cup of Nations. Agu said they are all fully focused o n preparations for the continental soccer showpiece, starting on June 21 in Egypt. The ex-international goalie stated during a live chat on a Lagos-based radio station that the Eagles’ preparations are going well, pledging that the players will give their best to make the country and their fans proud when action finally begins at Egypt 2019. Agu submitted: “We are staying focused on our preparations for the Africa Cup of Nation, and we want to get it right. “The preparations are going well, and we will try our best not to be distracted, because we know that is key to our success in Egypt. “We will take each match as it comes, without in any way underrating any opponent that we will play against.” While critics are wont to infer that the Eagles are relaxed because they are in virtually the easiest group of at Egypt 2019, with the debuting duo of Burundi and Madagascar in their pool, along with Guinea, Agu insists Nigeria is not underrating any of the opponents.
