The turmoil in the Imo state House of Assembly Thursday took a dramatic turn as the Deputy Speaker of the House; Hon. Ugonna Ozurigbo resigned his position. Ozurigbo’s resignation came barely a day after 21 of the 27 state lawmakers served impeachment notices on the Speaker, Acho Ihim and the Majority Leader, Hon. Lugard Osuji, suspending the duo in the process. The lawmakers who elected Chinedu Offor (AA, Onuimo) as acting Speaker and Lloyd Chukwuemeka (AA, Owerri North) as new Majority Leader, said that the two suspended principal officers had engaged in unparliamentary conduct by fleeing the assembly with the mace during Wednesday’s plenary. The resignation letter which was dated May 15, 2019, was received by the office of the Clark of the state House of Assembly on May 16, 2019. The letter of resignation which Ozurigbo personally signed was addressed to the Speaker and members of the state House of Assembly. Ozurigbo in the eight paragraph letter noted that he was resigning to enable him to function well as a member-elect of the House of Representatives.
