Following her remarkable outing at the just concluded 13th Central Bank of Nigeria Junior Tennis Championships, Nene Yakubu has declared her readiness to excel further in the domestic tennis stage. Representing Lagos, the 11-year-old made it to the third year running as she defeated Favour Amaechi of Rivers to clinch the U-12 title at Saturday’s final at the Lagos Lawn tennis Club. She had won the U-10 category in 2017 and 2018 and she is convinced that she would keep to her steady progress. “I’m very happy to win because I lost in the final of the Chevron Championship last month and that gave me the determination to which I played the final, she told New Telegraph. Having established herself as one of the upcoming starlets of Nigerian tennis, Nene is now on the radar of national team selectors for junior championship and she said the standard set by her older sibling Oiza will help her to success at regional and continental championships. “She is learning very fast and she is highly focused. She knows that her sister Oiza is doing well and she is inspired by the success of her older sister,” her mum, Jumoke Ajulo, a former national player, said. Like Nene, Oiza has been one of the star prospects of Nigerian tennis in recent years. Playing in her second major senior tournament at just 14, her exploit saw her reached the quarterfinals of the 2018 Rainoil Open in Lagos where she accounted for the exits of some high-profile opponents.
