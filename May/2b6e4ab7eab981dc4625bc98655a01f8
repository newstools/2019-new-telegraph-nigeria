Proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has lambasted President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo and three of the five South-East governors over their alleged indifference to planned honour of its brave Biafra men and women who fought so they may live.  Specifically, IPOB accused the Ohanaeze president and the South-East governors, who it described as “caliphate slaves” of canvassing that 12 hours of buying and selling is more important than honouring of 3.5million Biafrans killed during the Nigerian civil war and at other times on May 30 sit-at-home declared by the group.  It said: “It has been brought to our attention that the usual suspects are at it once again in their bid to undermine the collective will of all patriotic and genuine children of Biafra to honour those that died for us and 3.5 million victims of the second largest holocaust in modern history.  “Rather than anger, we feel pity for these collection of desperados who through their hatred for freedom and historical ignorance are canvassing that 12 hours of buying and selling is more important than honouring the brave men and women that fought they may live.  “It is the height of ingratitude, treachery and exhibition of crass ignorance that those who claim to be educated in this day and age do not understand the significance or appreciate the symbolism of honouring those unjustly killed.”
