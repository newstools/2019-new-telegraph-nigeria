A former President of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), Dr. Osahon Enabulele has called for the urgent establishment of a Residency Training Programme (RTP) Budget Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Committee (RTP BIMEC), as well as the full implementation of the Medical Residency Training Act of 2017.
Dr. Enabulele who is currently an executive committee member of the World Medical Association, made these calls while delivering a keynote address on ‘The Corollary of Government Policies on Residency Training” at the 39th Ordinary General Meeting and Scientific Conference of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), recently held in Benin City.
In a critical analysis of the policy and legal frameworks on Residency Training in Nigeria, Dr. Enabulele informed the audience that some steps had been taken by the government to address some challenges, including the issuance of a uniform template to guide the appointment and admission into the RTP; issuance of a policy statement directing strict adherence to the established scheme of service; and the enactment of the Medical Residency Training Act, MRTA, 2017, which was signed into law on June 26th, 2018 by President Muhammadu Buhari.
He stated that the policy and legal frameworks have attempted to cure some defects in the training programme, particularly as it concerns the determination of the career progression of Resident doctors; funding of the programme; the admission and entry requirements for the programme; and the standardisation of the structure and classification of the programme.
Tracing the history and structure of Residency Training Programme (RTP) in Nigeria, Dr. Enabulele stated that though the Residency Training Programme in Nigeria was yet to meet national aspirations and the vision of its founding fathers, the programme has nevertheless made significant contributions to Nigeria’s healthcare delivery system, particularly in terms of production of indigenous specialist medical and dental manpower and improved access to specialist medical and dental care.
