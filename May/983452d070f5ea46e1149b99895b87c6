As the May 29 inauguration date draws closer, the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meetings have been loaded with a lot of memos requiring lengthy sessions that last into the night every week. This trend has been particularly noticed in the last two sessions of the FEC. Last week meeting was presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo while President Muhammadu Buhari travelled to the United Kingdom (UK) for a private visit. A top government official told New Telegraph last night that Wednesday’s FEC meeting dedicated time to clear all outstanding memos presented by members of the cabinet. “There is nothing special. You know that there will be only two more FEC meetings before the inauguration date, so we want to clear the outstandings,” he said. Yesterday’s FEC meeting commenced at exactly 11a.m. and dragged into the night. President Buhari had at about 6:45p.m. suspended the meeting to allow Muslim fateful among the cabinet to break the Ramadan fast. The meeting resumed deliberation at about 7:15p.m. Our correspondent gathered that the meeting considered a total of 24 memos.
