Nigeria golden boy, Divine Oduduru has secured a place in the finals of the National Collegiate Athletics Association Outdoor Championships billed to take place between June 5-8.
The Nigerian sprinter, who is the fastest collegian this year, easily progressed in both 100m and 200m categories.
Oduduru clocked 10.06 in the 100m behind Cravon Gillespie, who recorded a time of 10.03, to book his spot in the final.
Oduduru then placed second overall in the 200m with 20.08 behind Texas Tech teammate Andrew Hudson (20.04).
The duo later teamed up to win the 4x100m in 39.00, just 0.03 ahead of an Oregon squad that featured Gillespie on the second leg.
A flurry of speedy sprint performances headlined both NCAA Preliminaries as US collegiate athletes attempted to book their spots at next monthâ€™s NCAA Championships by placing among the top 12 in their events.
