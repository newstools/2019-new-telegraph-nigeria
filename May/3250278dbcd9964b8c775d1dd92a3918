Nigeria senior men’s volleyball team has beaten Burkina Faso in their last Zone 3 qualifiers to clinch qualification to 2019 All Africa Games in Morocco.
The coach Japhet Nuhu-tutored team defeated their Burkinabes counterparts 3-0 (25-15, 25-22, 25-15) in Abidjan.
The victory meant Nigeria clinched the sole ticket for the Zone 3 which consists of Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Niger Republic.
Head coach of the team, Japhet Nuhu, attributed the feat to the determination of the players and the support of the Musa Nimrod-led Volleyball Federation of Nigeria.
The Niger brass coach said, “I am glad this team has qualified for the 2019 All Africa Games in Morocco. It could have been disastrous if we did not qualify because the board led by Nimrod has invested so much in the team.
“Before the boys went to the court, I told them the volleyball family was expecting good news and we could not afford to disappoint them. This is a new beginning for volleyball in Nigeria.”
Captain of the team, Daniel Nathaniel, said securing qualification was a ‘dream come true’ and promised to maintain the standard of the team at the AAG.
“This is a dream come true for me because I will be leading Nigeria to the All Africa Games as a captain. We promise not to lower the standard of our game when we get to the 2019 All Africa Games in Morocco,” Nathaniel said.
