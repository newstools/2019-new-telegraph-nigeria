•New Telegraph’s MD re-elected NGE President unopposed  Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Lagos State Governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode and Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed have all urged the media to continue to adhere strictly to the code of ethics to preserve the sanctity of the profession.
Speaking yesterday at the 2019 Biennial Convention of the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) with the theme: “Media Convergence as Strategy for Survival”, which held at the Airport Hotel in Ikeja, Lagos, Osinbajo urged media managers to be open to the reality that the new and digital media was gradually taking over the traditional media.  The Vice President, who was represented by his Senior Special Assistant, Media and Publicity, Mr. Laolu Akande, also called on leaders of Nigeria’s media industry to rise up against bastardisation of the profession, noting that media professionals should evolve strategies to take back the media space infiltrated by unethical practices with the advent of the social media.  He also tasked media professionals to take control of the new media space in the country, saying their activities if not well managed, could serve as major setbacks for the profession.
He added that the concentration given to the printed newspaper must also be given to the online news publications to assist the profession in remaining relevant in the society.  According the Vice President, the new media had been saturated with several mushroom platforms, which do not regard the ethics of the profession in disseminating information.  His words: “Editors must now take over the online media as seriously as they did to the traditional media and that move has to be unprecedented. What we see today is that instant reporting is making mincemeat of the virtues of cross checking facts before <img class="size-medium wp-image-1529 alignleft" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FUNKE-EGBEMODE-300x178.png?resize=300%2C178&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="178" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FUNKE-EGBEMODE.png?resize=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/FUNKE-EGBEMODE.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1">publishing. “Since the role of editors is quality control and gate keeping, of the things they must do is to manage the new media and place some form of control. Some people must take the lead to speak up against the bastardization of the new media as it is gradually relegating investigative journalism.” Noting that failure to uphold the media ethics will be detrimental to the profession, the Vice President urged the media managers to invest in technology and equip newsrooms with gadgets and technology that could detect and remove fake images from news items, adding that they must continue to strive to ensure that they maintain the ethics of the media profession always. “I urge you to continue to abide by the journalism code of ethics of honesty, independence, accuracy, balance and public accountability. The time has come for editors to ensure that the thread of journalists of repute does not become a thing of the past,” he said.  While commending efforts of past veterans who made a mark in the field of journalism, Osinbajo urged today’s journalists to ensure accurate, fair, balanced and objective reportage at all times. He called for adherence to ethical standards, adding that the NGE represented the place of mentorship for journalists. He also charged the NGE and media owners to review remuneration of journalists to enhance their welfare and efficiency. Also speaking, Governor Ambode, who was the host governor, said the media must continue to up the ante in its primary responsibility as the watchdog of the society. Describing the theme of the convention as apt, the governor, who spoke through Lagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Kehinde Bamigbetan, said the state government has drawn ideas and policy formation as well as execution from the criticisms and suggestions from the media. “We have learnt from your informed commentaries, reflecting deep concern about the need for solutions to problems that all of us worry about uninterrupted electricity, efficient transportation, affordable housing and the ease of doing business.
“What we have witnessed in Lagos State in the past four years and particularly the commissioning of transformational projects in recent times bear testimony to the fact that your criticisms and suggestions towards a liveable megacity have contributed to our policy formulation and execution,” he said. The governor alluded to the fact that his administration benefitted immensely from the coverage of landmark programmes and projects as media monitoring records revealed over 80 percent reportage of the state government in the last four years was positive.  “I appeal that the guild continue to see the stables and the titles as stakeholders whose social responsibility to actualise the vision of a greater Lagos will be   taken to the next level by my successor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the incoming governor,” he said. Governor Ambode also commended the Nigerian Guild of Editors for the choice of Lagos as the venue of its conference, saying it was not just a vote of confidence in his administration for building a safe and secure city, but also an editorial comment on the freedom of the press as a fundamental pillar of the democratic culture of Lagos State. In his remarks, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who was represented by the Director of Information in the ministry, Mr. Sunday Baba, noted that the media has been a very important pillar in the sustenance of the country’s democratic process serving as the credible source of balanced information for the public. The chairman of the convention, Mr. Dan Agbese, stressed that media organisations must re-strategies to sustain their relevance in the society. Agbese noted that the challenges facing Nigeria is because media organisations have relapsed in their duties of shaping the agenda for the society. “Our nation must be safe for us to practice journalism effectively. So the media managers in the country must not wear plastic faces but reflect the true state of affairs,” he said. In her address, the NGE’s President, Mrs Funke Egbemode commended Vice President Osinbajo, Governor Ambode, Alhaji Mohammed and other members of the guild for their support and confidence reposed in her to lead the guild. “The support and kindness that I have enjoyed in the last 24 months, I deeply appreciate and I will forever cherish. Of course, in the course of this sweet two-year relationship, I must have occasionally rubbed you the wrong way. There must have been times I didn’t hug you warmly enough or smiled nicely enough. There must have been times this exco took decision you either didn’t quite agree with or didn’t understand and to worsen all that, we didn’t even explain. “Imagine communication complications among professionals whose business it is to communicate. I will not make excuses. I’m here to apologise sincerely for missteps and that of the team.” She explained that every decision taken by the Standing Committee of the guild was done in the best interest of the entire members of the guild. “We never at any time point took a decision to slight or disrespect you or dishonour the mandate you freely gave us,” Egbemode added. Meanwhile, Egbemode, who is the Managing Director/Editor-in-Chief of New Telegraph, was re-elected unopposed yesterday for another term as the President of NGE by the conference delegates.
