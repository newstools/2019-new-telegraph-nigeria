A coalition of youth groups across the nine Niger Delta states, under the aegis of the Concerned Citizens of Niger Delta (CCND), has called on the Federal Government to release without delay the backlog of allocations owed the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) with a view to enabling the agency fulfill its core mandate of developing the region. Besides, the groups demanded additional funds as the Commission is grappling with fresh challenges of developing the youths to further stem militancy in the region. Addressing newsmen yesterday in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State capital, the President- General of the Coalition, Michael Zika Uduefe, explained that allocation of more funding to the Commission has become necessary in order to enable the new NDDC board, led by Prof. Nelson Brambaifa, to sustain the ongoing drive to douse tension in the region. He, therefore, pointed out that the new board had shown more commitment towards improving infrastructure and human capital development, saying several contractors had been mobilised for road projects, while educational and scholarship grants are being awarded to local and foreign students, as well as provision of vocational training for youths in the region. Zika said: â€œUnlike former Managing Directors of the Commission, who used the agency as a springboard towards the attainment of elective political offices, Prof. Brambaifa has been passionate in taking development to all Niger Delta region in the last three months.
