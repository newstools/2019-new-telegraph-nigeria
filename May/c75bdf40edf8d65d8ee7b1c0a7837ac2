English giants, Chelsea and Arsenal will continue their quests for continental glory today when they return to the Europa League at the Stamford Bridge and Mestalla respectively. While Chelsea will host Eintracht in London, Arsenal will travel to Spain for the second leg of their tie against Valencia. Both matches will be broadcast in Nigeria by StarTimes on its Channels 254 and 245. Arsenal could be in for a nervy second leg in the Europa League after their opponents Valencia thumped struggling Huesca 6-2 in La Liga. The North London side appear to have one foot in the Europa League final in Baku, which takes place on May 29, after a 3-1 win at the Emirates Stadium in the first leg. A double from Alexandre Lacazette and a late strike from Pierre- Emerick Aubameyang means the Spanish side have it all to do at the Mestalla on Thursday. But Unai Emery’s side stuttered to a 1-1 draw against Brighton on Sunday, leaving them out of the reckoning for a top four finish in the Premier League. Their only realistic chance of qualifying for Europe’s premier competition is by winning the Europa League – and they may have to beat Chelsea in order to do so. Chelsea, meanwhile, secured their place in next season’s competition with a 3-0 win over Watford, although they could be without N’Golo Kante for the second leg after he came off injured in the first half. According to StarTimes, football lovers will enjoy the thrills and actions of the games on ST World Football (Channels 244 and 254), ST Sport Premium (channel 246) and on the Mobile App.
