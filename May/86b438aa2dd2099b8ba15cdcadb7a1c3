Rwanda President, Paul Kagame and his Senegalese counterpart, Macky Sall, are among dignitaries , who will join United Bank for Africa (UBA) Chairman, Tony Elumelu, as his Foundation, the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF), hosts its 5th Annual Forum — the largest annual gathering of African entrepreneurs – on July 26 – 27 in Abuja.  The Forum, according to a statement, is the culmination of the annual Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Programme, which this year mentored, trained and seeded over 3,000 young Africans, selected from over [216,000] applicants.  The event provides a unique opportunity for young women and men, from all 54 African countries, to meet, learn and network with the broader African and global entrepreneurship ecosystem. It is also a critical opportunity for political leaders and policymakers to meet, face to face, a new generation of African business leaders, who are transforming Africa’s economic trajectory.  The Forum, which will be hosted in Abuja for the first time, according to the statement, will bring together leading policymakers, business leaders, development agencies and the entire entrepreneurship ecosystem including alumni of the Foundation’s Entrepreneurship Programme.  Last year, a significant highlight was the launch of TEFConnect, the digital networking platform for African entrepreneurs, which provides a unique digital hub for the African entrepreneurship, facilitating networking, mentorship and most importantly business beyond borders.  Previous Forums have been headlined by African leaders, including the President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, President of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta, former President of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo, Former Prime Minister of Benin and TEF Advisory Board Member, Lionel Zinsou, and Vice President of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo.  According to the statement: “The Tony Elumelu Foundation’s determination to bring change in scale, across Africa and its relentless focus on entrepreneurship is rooted in the inclusive philosophy of Africapitalism, created by its Founder, which recognizes economically empowering Africa’s youth — the continent’s future wealth creators — and thereby creating sustainable economic and social wealth, as one of the most pressing issues of the 21st century. “
