S&P predicts Nigerian banks’ credit losses to reduce to 2.75 per cent this year   Deposit money banks (DMBs) in Nigeria seem to be making steady progress in cleaning their balance sheets of bad debts, as industry Q1 2019 results so far released show that lenders generally recorded further drop in impairment charges.  Unlike the period, especially between 2016 and 2017, when the slump in oil prices led to a significant rise in Nigerian banks’ non-performing loans (NPLs), such that in its statement of accounts for 2017, the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) put DMBs’ NPLs for that year at N2.36 trillion, reviews of the industry’s full year 2018 results showed a steady reduction in bad debts. The downward trend in NPLs is clearly being maintained according to New Telegraph’s analysis of first quarter 2019 results of some key banks. For instance, Guaranty Trust Bank (GTBank) recorded a 60.27 per cent reduction in impairment charge from N1.64 billion in Q1 2018 to N651million in the same period this year. It was followed by Zenith Bank, which reported a 54.17 per cent reduction in impairment charge, declining from N4.57 billion in Q1 2018 to N2.10 billion in the same period this year. Also, FBN Holdings Plc. recorded a 47.2 per cent drop in impairment charge from N25.3 billion in the first quarter of last year to N13.4 billion in Q1 2019. Again, Access Bank reported a 31.97 per cent reduction in impairment charge from N4.96 billion in Q1 2018 to N3.38 billion in the same period this year. Leading Tier 2 lender, Sterling bank’s impairment charge fell by 35.15 per cent to N843 million in the first quarter of this year from N1.3 billion recorded in Q1 2018. The United Bank for Africa (UBA), however, recorded an increase in impairment charge from N1.45 billion in the first quarter of last year to N1.71 billion in Q1 2019. Fidelity Bank reported an increase in impairment charge from N702 million in the first quarter of last year to N1.04 billion in the same period of this year. This means that the total impairment charges of the seven banks fell by 42.95 per cent to N22.781 billion in the first quarter of this year from N39.93 billion in the same period of Q1 2018. Financial analysts point out that contrary to initial speculation that the commencement of the implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS 9) in the industry last year will lead to a significant increase in banks’ loan loss provisioning, the reverse has actually been the case.  Issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), IFRS-9 were adopted by the Nigerian banking industry on January 1, 2012, as part of measures to improve reporting practices, transparency and disclosure among lenders. Consequently, the country was expected to comply, when the IASB, in July 2014, issued the final version of IFRS 9 to replace IAS 39 (Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement) and required all reporting entities that had adopted IFRS to implement the new accounting standard by January 1, 2018.  For instance, commenting on the banks’ 2018 Full Year results, analysts at Financial Derivatives Company (FDC) Limited noted that the financial statements indicate: “Profitability driven by non-interest income and lower impairment; IFRS 9 helped drive down impairment across board; declining loan books due to relatively low demand for credit and reduced capacity of  banks to lend.” Also, in a recent report, one of the global credit rating agencies, Standard and Poor’s (S&P), said it expects credit losses in the Nigerian banking sector to reduce to 2.75 per cent and two per cent in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The agency, which stated this, while commenting on the completion of the Merger and Acquisition (M&A) deal between Access and Diamond banks, noted that the combination of the two lenders will lead to all NPLs being transferred to Access Bank, even as the Tier 1 lender’s cost of risk will also rise. But despite the expected increase in the level of Access Bank’s NPLs, S&P said this will not negatively impact the lender’s asset quality metrics. Specifically, the agency said: “All non-performing loans (NPLs) are to be transferred to Access Bank as a result of the deal. Similarly, cost of risk will increase to 1.4 per cent -1.5 per cent in 2019, as Access Bank will have to make additional Stage 2 and 3 loan impairments. We forecast that Access Bank will write off about N120 billion in 2019 and net charge-offs will average 0.5 per cent – 1.0 per cent of average customer loans between 2020 and 2021.  “We expect credit losses to normalize thereafter at around 1.0 per cent -1.2 per cent, reflecting the good credit quality of Access Bank’s loan portfolio, which comprises about 50 per cent investment-grade corporate clients. To put this in context, we expect credit losses in the sector to reduce to 2.75 per cent in 2019 and 2.5 per cent in 2020. Access Bank’s asset quality metrics will compare adequately to top peers in Nigeria and regional peers,” S&P said.
