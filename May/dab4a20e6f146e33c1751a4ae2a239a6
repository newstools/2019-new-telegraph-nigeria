The Executive Committee of the Lagos State Chapter of the Sports Writers Association of Nigeria, has joined millions of Lagosians in congratulating Babajide Sanwo-Olu as he marks his first day in office as the Executive Governor of Lagos State.
In a statement signed by its Chairman, Debo Oshundun, Lagos SWAN said the inauguration of Sanwo-Olu as the 15th Governor (Military and democratically elected) of Lagos State was coming at a most auspicious time when sound and experienced leadership is needed to move the state forward.
“May 29 marked another milestone in the history of Lagos state as the leadership baton exchanged hands. We congratulate Babajide Sanwo-Olu and his deputy, Babafemi Hamzat,” the statement said.
“To become the Governor of Lagos State is no mean feat. It comes with its attendant demands, challenges and expectations. The emergence of Sanwo-Olu and Hamzat was a product of hard work and dedication.” As a professional association, Lagos SWAN urges them to see the task of building a greater Lagos as one that demands even deeper level of commitment and sincerity of purpose. “With the teeming population of youths in Lagos state, the government under Sanwo-Olu must utilise the immense wealth-creation potentials of sports. The sector must be treated as a revenue generating source and not, as has been in the past, merely a way of engaging youths.”
