A late goal from Nathan Ake has given Bournemouth a 1-0 victory over nine-man Tottenham Hotspur in Saturday’s Premier League fixture at the Vitality Stadium. Spurs had Son Heung-min and Juan Foyth sent off either side of half time, and the North London outfit were denied an admirable draw when Ake netted with a header in the first minute of added-on time.  Bournemouth now sit in 12th position in the standings, but Spurs could be left with work to do in their final fixture against Everton in order to qualify for next season’s Champions League.  Cherries boss Eddie Howe opted to hand a first-team debut to goalkeeper Mark Travers, but the 19-yearold was almost embarrassed within eight minutes as Lucas Moura sent a shot from the halfway line over the youngster’s head and marginally wide of the post.  However, Travers quickly showed that he had settled into the game with a sharp save from Dele Alli, and that was followed by a Moura strike from inside the area being tipped over the crossbar. The Brazilian was then successful in beating the offside trap before firing straight at Travers from an acute angle, while the Irishman also managed to divert a powerful Alli header over the bar.  Spurs were in full control of the contest with 10 minutes of the first half remaining, but Eric Dier should have been handed a second yellow card when preventing Josh King from launching a counter-attack by the halfway line. Bournemouth began to have more success before the break with King seeing a shot blocked by Hugo Lloris, while Dier was again fortunate when appearing to trip Callum Wilson in the penalty area
