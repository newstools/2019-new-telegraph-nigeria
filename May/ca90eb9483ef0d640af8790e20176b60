Some workers of the Ekiti State University, Ado-Ekiti (EKSU), yesterday protested against the management of the institution over non-payment of their 11 months’ deduction from their monthly salary to cooperative societies. The protesters, who included academic and non-academic staff, were members of various cooperative societies in the university. The protesters, who moved from the institution’s Administrative Bloc at about 8:10a.m. proceeded to the campus gate to express their grievances. They were seen with various placards bearing their thoughts and agitations among which were “Enough is Enough”, pay our 11 months’ salary, “No more half salaries”, “Our members are dying”, “Help! Help! Save Our Soul EKSU is killing us”, “O to ge, pay our outstanding salary.” Addressing journalists during the protest yesterday, President of Academic Staff Union of University cooperative society, Prof. Awe Ariyo alleged that a deduction up to N1.8 billion was not remitted to the cooperative societies’ account, making it difficult to access the loan.
