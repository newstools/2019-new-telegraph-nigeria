Katsina State Commissioner of Police, Sanusi Buba, has relocated his office to Daura, as operation to rescue Magajin Garin Daura, Alhaji Musa Umar Uba, heats up. The Magajin Gari, a district head in Daura Emirate Council, was abducted in front of his house on Wednesday. The police said its patrol teams in Kusada Division intercepted and engaged the abductors in a gun duel. The police added that during the exchange of fire, an officer, Inspector Muntari Maikudi, was injured. The Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO), Frank Mba, said that Buba was right now in the heart of Daura, coordinating security and investigative operations aimed at rescuing Uba. He said: “Currently, there are massive strategic security operations, both covert and overt missions, taking place at different parts of the country, including Katsina aimed at subduing the criminal gangs and restoring sanity to the land.
“However, because of the covert and sensitive nature of these operations, I will not discuss them for now. But Nigerians should be assured that the entire law enforcement and intelligence community in Nigeria will not rest until we win the battle against crimes and criminality in Nigeria.” It was learnt that Inspector-General of Police (IG), Mohammed Adamu’s Tactical Squad, operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and other arms of the police have joined in the rescue operation.
