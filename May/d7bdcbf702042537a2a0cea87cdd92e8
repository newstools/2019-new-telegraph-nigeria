After his plea, the court reviewed the facts of the case as submitted by the prosecution counsel, Mr Jeremiah Aernan, Aernan tendered in evidence, a written statement of the defendant, a request for scientific aid form, a drug analysis form and the substance. He urged the court to admit them in evidence. Justice Aneke admitted them as exhibits. He convicted Sikiru based on the facts on the case and his guilty plea. The judge directed that the sentence should start from the date of his arrest – Feb. 7. The prosecution counsel had said that Sikiru was arrested at the White Sand area of Ijora,  Lagos State, with the drug.
