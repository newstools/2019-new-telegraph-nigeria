Former Flying Eagles coach John Obuh has urged Nigerians to exercise patience with the team following their 2-0 defeat to the United States of America at the on-going FIFA U-20 World Cup in Poland, insisting the side can still go far in the competition despite the setback .
Obuh said although the boys did not play to the expectation of Nigerians against the United States, they could still qualify from the group if they focus on their next tie with Ukraine.
He thereafter urged Nigerians to give the team the benefit of the doubt going to the final group game against Ukraine.
“We all agreed that their performance was not as expected but I know how difficult to play at the World Cup; the boys might be under great pressure to perform and this I think cost them the game against the USA.
“So in this situation, let’s give them the benefit of the doubt that at least we have all seen the level of their performance, the coaches are not daft, it’s just a question of been patient with them,” he said.
