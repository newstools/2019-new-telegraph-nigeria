ABEOKUTA The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) senatorial candidate for Ogun East in the 2019 general election, Hon. Adeola Sosanwo, yesterday expressed confidence in the newly constituted election petitions tribunal in the state.  Sosanwo, who lost the election to the candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Lekan Mustapha, vowed to pursue his case and reclaim his mandate at the tribunal. Speaking with reporters in Sagamu, the PDP candidate claimed that the election was rigged in favour of Mustapha, hence his resolve to seek redress in court.  He said: “We are at the tribunal with all the evidence that the election was rigged. The election was   not fair at all. My mandate was wrongfully taken from me, but I am hopeful that I will get it back. “I am convinced that we won the election despite their rigging and manipulation of results. I am going to follow this through to the end until I get my mandate back. The right thing must be done.”  “Let me put on record that I have never collected a dime from anyone. My confidence is not in any man. I am fighting this battle alone, but I put my trust in God who never fails. I believe justice will prevail in the end. “It is only God that makes one a leader and not the making of any godfather. I pray the judges at the tribunal would do the right thing as I believe the truth will prevail in the end. I know I am going to get my mandate back.”
