…says Abiodun ‘ll access $350m W/Bank loan The outgoing governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, yesterday, said he was not afraid of any threat to reverse or review the programmes and initiatives of his administration. Amosun, who stated that he inherited a failed state upon assuming office in 2011, expressed confidence that his successor would continue with his current efforts to expand investment and revenue profile of the state. The governor spoke at the launch of Ogun State Investment Promotion and Facilitation Agency (OgunInvest) held at the MITROS Residences, Abeokuta. Represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Taiwo Adeoluwa, the governor said his government had completed all necessary processes to enable the next administration access the $350million loan from the World Bank. According to him, the government initiatives in commercial growth have attracted 423 mega industries and over 1,000 small and medium scale enterprises within the last eight years. He pointed out that under his government, the state rose to second in terms of revenue generation and fifth on the Ease of Doing Business Index in the federation. Amosun explained that the new investment agency, which was established via an Executive Order, would serve as a one-stop shop for potential investors and interface between government and investors. Answering questions on the sustainability of his administration’s programmes against the backdrop of comment by the Governor-elect, Dapo Abiodun, to review them, Amosun insisted that he had no fear at all. He said, “I do not believe that any administration will reverse or stop an initiative that has just one objective: to benefit the people of Ogun State.”
