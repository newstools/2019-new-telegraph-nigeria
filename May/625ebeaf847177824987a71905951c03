Stability
Reserves increased by $66.91m between April 16 and April 29  Nigeria’s foreign exchange reserves were stable throughout April, rising to $44.80billion as at April 29, 2019 data obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) showed yesterday. New Telegraph’s analysis of the Apex Bank’s data shows that the reserves rose by $66.91million between April 16 and April 29. Further review of the data indicates that the reserves stood at $44.43billion as at March 29, 2019. According to financial analysts, surging oil prices have helped to boost the reserves as well as the naira. For instance in a note issued at the weekend, analysts at Cowry Asset Management Limited stated: “Nigeria, the largest oil producing country in Africa, is expected to benefit from increased oil price, given the 2019 budget benchmark for crude oil price which was pegged at USD60 per barrel and production volume of 2.3 million barrels per day (bpd). “According to OPEC’s Monthly Oil Market Report released for March 2019, Nigeria’s crude oil production averaged at 1,729 million bpd in Q1 2019, despite the inclusion of the oil rich country in the crude oil production cuts by OPEC. Thus, apart from the Excess Crude Oil Account (ECA) which is expected to rise, we also expect stability of the exchange rate amid accretion to external reserves, as well as reduced inflation risk, especially imported food inflation, and an indirect positive effect on interest rate.” Similarly, analysts at Financial Derivatives Company (FDC) Limited said in a recent report that: “External reserves accretion is positive for naira stability.” They noted that the exchange rate was stable at N360/$ in April. It would be recalled that Nigeria’s foreign reserves stood at $43.08billion on the first day of 2019.
