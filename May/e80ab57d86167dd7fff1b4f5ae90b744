Former international, Enefiok Udo-Obong, has said the recent performance of Divine Oduduru, has proved that the country has a lot of talents and just have to put the right things in place for them to excel. Speaking with New Telegraph, the Nigeria Olympic Committee athletes’ representative said Oduduru peaked at the right time. According to him, it takes four years for an athlete to be ready for major championships and with what the Texas Tech student has done, he will continue to excel. “Oduduru came to limelight in 2013 and he is peaking in 2019 which shows he is in the right direction,” he said. “The performance only shows us that we have talents in this country and all we just need to do will be to put the right atmosphere and technical input in place for them to excel. “It takes four years for an athlete to peak and he has been doing that since 2013 leading to what he started at the start of the year.” Meanwhile, Divine Oduduru at the weekend qualified for the 2020 Olympic Games in style after clocking another sub 10secs in the space of one month. Oduduru clocked a Personal Best and World Leading time of 9.94secs just three weeks ago at the Michael Johnson Invitational, and followed it up with a 9.99secs at the Big 12 Championships on Sunday evening. In the heats on Saturday, the Texas Tech athlete peeled off the field to claim the win with a time of 10.11secs, and on Sunday, the 2018 NCAA 200m champion ran the 2nd leg as he first helped the Red Raiders 4x100m quartet to set a new School Record of 38.83s to clinch Gold in the event. Barely an hour later, he was back on the track to outclass the rest of the field in the 100m final, clocking 9.99secs to take the win ahead of Joseph Sheffield (10.29secs) and Micaiah Harris (10.34secs) who finished second and third respectively. Oduduru’s feat on Sunday made him the first athlete ever to run sub-10secs at the Big 12 Champs, consequently replacing the seven-year-old of Prezel Hardy Jr. (10.03secs) as the new Meet Record. The Nigerian also now holds the record for the fastest time ran at the Stadium which was previously held by John Garrison since 1976. With the qualification standard for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics being 10.04secs for the 100m, Oduduru becomes only the second Nigerian 100m athlete to seal qualification to the World Sports Fiesta after Raymond Ekevwo clocked a 10.02secs PB at the SEC Championships on Saturday to first punch his ticket.
