A Coalition of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) for Peace and Good Governance, have made an appeal to the newly elected members of the National Assembly awaiting inauguration, to improve funding to the Office of the Surveyor General of the Federation (OSGOF). Addressing newsmen yesterday in Abuja, Convener of the Coalition, Comrade Jonathan Ogwuche, said there was need for the OSGOF to get the attention it deserves, in order to address the series of intra/interstate and communities boundary disputes and building mishaps which has led to the loss of several lives, properties, and other associated losses. The CSOs further commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the attention he gave the OSGOF during his first tenure, which gave rise to the significant milestones achieved in the sector in the last four years. “Recall that Nigeria was riddled with interstate and several communities boundary disputes on the one hand while on the other matters of housing and citing of infrastructure where only shabbily attended to. This came with its attendant challenges including a rampant spate of building collapse and other associated losses. “We were therefore delighted when this government decided to give proper attention to the Office of the Surveyor General of the Federation with the necessary support as fillip for success. Today, the surveying and mapping systems deployed by the Office of the Surveyor General are miles ahead of what hitherto obtained,” he said.
