Commonwealth Games 100m hurdles champion, Tobiloba Amusan, hopes to impress as she makes her debut at the 2019 IAAF Diamond League in Doha, Qatar on today (Friday).  The Nigerian who has been listed among the nine sprint hurdlers to compete for the $10,000 prize money and eight points on offer for the first ranked athlete, will have to contend with familiar foes Mcneal Brianna and Danielle Williams to win the prize. Amusan has been impressive since she made her debut last year at the Golden Gala in Rome where she ran 12.86 seconds to place fourth.  At the final in Brussels she ran 12.69 seconds, her second fastest time to finish fourth behind Brianna (12.61), Kendra Harrison (12.63) and Danielle (12.64). Also, reigning African 200m record holder Blessing Okagbare-Ighoteguonor aims for her first win on her seventh visit. She has finished second on three occasions in long jump and 100m combined.  Okagbare came second in the long jump with a leap of 7.14m in 2013, while in the 100m, she fell .05 seconds shy of Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pyrce’s 11.13 seconds finish in 2014 and last year, she broke 10 seconds for the first time with her 10.90 seconds run bettered only by Marie-Jose Ta Lou’s world leading 10.85 seconds run.
