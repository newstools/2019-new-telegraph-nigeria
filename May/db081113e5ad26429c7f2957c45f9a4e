Kano State Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, yesterday said the state government had so far spent N1 billion in the training of teachers to acquire the minimum qualification of National Certificate of Education (NCE) even as teachers’ promotion attracted additional N500 million monthly.  The governor, who spoke at the 2019 Workers’ Day in Kano, also said that he was introducing workers’ job description and specification to enhance services, even as he said that from next year, Kano State would celebrate May Day with a difference. “Ours is going to be celebrated internationally and we would invite every stakeholder in labour worldwide to come to the state and participate in fashioning out a way out for workers.”  According to Governor Ganduje, there were new innovations to be introduced by his government to make May Day more colourful, effective, efficient and flamboyant.  The ceremony would include award night, symposium and dinner as well as a programme to appreciate workers that excelled in the discharge of their duties. He said the state government was planning to reward productivity, especially for workers that showed commitment either in the private or public sector in the state.  The governor told the workers: “I do appreciate you, you have done well, your services are attractive and that is why we won’t hesitate to pay you back excellently, so as to enable every one of you put more effort in discharging their duties.”  He said the state government had since maintained the practice of paying its workforce promptly every month despite the meager resources at its disposal. He said no single worker was crying for lack of salaries or other entitlements, he said.
