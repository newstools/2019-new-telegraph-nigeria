The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has rescheduled the Kogi and Bayelsa State governorship elections for November 16. The commission had on April 9 this year, fixed date for the two elections for November 2. But following an appeal by the Bayelsa State stakeholders that November 2 every year has been observed, for the last seven years, as annual Thanksgiving Day, INEC, after its management meeting yesterday, changed the date to November 16. A statement by Festus Okoye, INEC National Commissioner in charge of Information and Voter Education, said the commission it acceded to the request. The statement reads: “It will be recalled that on 9th April 2019, the Independent National Electoral Commission (lNEC) released the timetable and schedule of activities for the Kogi and Bayelsa governorship elections. The commission fixed 2nd November for the elections to hold in both states. “However. the commission has received several appeals from the government, state Assembly, elders, religious leaders, traditional rulers and other critical stakeholders in Bayelsa State, that the election date coincides with the state’s annual Thanksgiving Day which is backed by the Bayelsa State Thanksgiving Day Law 2012. “After careful consideration of the appeals, the commission at its regular weekly meeting held today, Thursday 16th May, decided to shift the governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa States to Saturday 16th November 2019. “The timelines for all other activities leading to the elections have also been adjusted to align with the new date.” Bayelsa State deputy governor, Rear Admiral John Jona had on Tuesday this week, led a delegation of stakeholders from the state to the INEC headquarters to appeal for a shift on the date for the election. “Any other date that is fixed that will not clash with this day (November 2) will be good for us,” the delegation had requested.
