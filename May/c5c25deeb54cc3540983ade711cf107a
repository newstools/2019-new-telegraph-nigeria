Worried by the poor number of women in public and elective positions, Nigerian Women groups, activists and professions have urged President Muhammadu Buhari to accommodate more women in the incoming administration by ensuring that more women are involved in the processes of decision-making.
The Nigerian Women groups, activists and professions, which comprised about 150 organisations in a statement presented to the President’s wife, Aisha Buhari during at interactive section at the weekend in Abuja, said Nigeria’s system of governance cannot be democratic if it continues to stifle the voices of women and make inadequate or no provision for the inclusion of women’s voices and perspectives in the processes of decision-making.
The statement, which was signed by leaders of Transition Monitoring Group (TMG), Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), Women Advocates Research and Documentation Center (WARDC), Federation of Informal Workers of Nigeria (FIWON), Women Consortium of Nigeria (WOCON), Women in Politics Forum, Federation of Muslim Women Association in Nigeria (FOMWAN) and Women Wing of the Christian Association of Nigeria (WOWICAN), among others, also urged Mrs. Buhari “as the mother of the nation,” to carry the pain, hope and prayers of the women groups to the ears of the president, legislators, community leaders and private sector.
The statement reads in part: “As Nigeria prepares for a new administration, it is imperative that government at federal, state and local government levels, prioritise women’s inclusion in the political and governance arena.”
