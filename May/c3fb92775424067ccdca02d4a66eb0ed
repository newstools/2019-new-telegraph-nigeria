Archbishop of Enugu Anglican Province, Most Reverend Emmanuel Chukwuma has called out the leadership of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to desist from creating confusion in the polity with their call for a sit-at-home on May 30 saying that such action has become inconsequential. Archbishop Chukwuma, who gave the charge yesterday during the 3rd session of the 11th Synod at St Judeâ€™s Anglican Church Adazi Ani, Anaocha Council Area, Anambra State, insisted that with the elections over and governors and president elected, what the separatist group should focus on now should be how to ensure that the elected officials offer good governance to the people. The cleric urged the people to disregard the call to sit at home on that day describing the call as self-serving. He advised the residents of the Southeast and indeed every Nigerian to close ranks and insist on good governance and not violence. He added that Ndigbo should work hard together to salvage the nation by speaking with one voice rather than aligning with agents of confusion. Chukwuma, who also reacted to the current security situation in the country, condemned the level of banditry and herdsmen killings in strong terms, saying it is inhuman and savagery to waste lives. He called on the Service Chiefs to either live up to their responsibilities or resign, insisting that they have failed Nigerians.
