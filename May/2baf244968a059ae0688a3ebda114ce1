…as external reserve hits $44.69 billion  The Federal Government has raked into the national treasury a whopping sum of N605 billion from its implementation of the whistleblower policy. Minister of Finance, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, who disclosed this at a world press conference yesterday, also said that Nigeria’s external reserve which stood at $28.3 billion in 2015, has risen to $44.69 billion as at May 13, 2019. Ahmed stated that the present administration had shown commitment towards the implementation of the whistleblower policy. The anti-corruption policy was launched in December 2016, to tackle cases of stolen funds and financial mismanagement by individuals or organisations. According to her, the whistleblower policy has been a huge success, adding that the policy has not been discontinued as being insinuated in some quarters. “The whistleblower policy of government subsists and it is still being implemented. The total amount of collection that has been made through various efforts in the whistleblower policy is about N605 billion. “Our external reserves on the other hand, grew from $28.3 billion in 2015 to $44.69 billion as at May 13, 2019 representing significant improvement that has helped stabilize the economy, including our currency exchange rates. Our foreign exchange market remained relatively stable from 2017 with the convergence of the NIFEX and NAFEX windows witnessed by November 2018. “Let me first underscore the vital role of domestic revenue mobilization for continued economic success and inclusive growth in Nigeria. Indeed, President Muhammadu Buhari underscored the urgent need for improved revenue performance during his 2019 budget speech, and he directed the acceleration of all revenue initiatives. “The time to act is now – if we do not address the long standing issue of ‘unsatisfactory revenue performance’ in Nigeria, particularly in the non-oil sector, we will never realize our shared goal of ensuring appropriate financing for critical sectors such as health, education, and infrastructure, and ultimately of co-creating a Nigeria where no one is left behind,” she said. Ahmed said she heeded President Buhari’s important call to action, by prioritizing revenue generation and formally launching the Strategic Revenue Growth Initiatives, a suite of comprehensive and cross-cutting interventions aimed at boosting revenue performance. She expressed delight that significant progress had been made since the launching of the initiatives. Ahmed noted that the Federal Ministry of Finance has achieved growth on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in seven consecutive quarters since the country’s exit from recession in Q2, 2017. “As at Q4 2018, the economy grew by 2.38% in real terms (year-on-year), representing an increase of 0.27% compared to Q4 2017 and, a rise of 0.55% compared with the growth rate in Q3 2018. Overall, GDP grew at an annual rate of 1.93% in 2018 compared with 0.82% in 2017, representing an overall increase of 1.11% year on year,” she said. However, the minister acknowledged that the expenditure performance cannot be assessed in isolation of revenues. “In 2018, our budgeted revenue was N7.2 trillion. This is against the realised figure of N3.96 trillion, signifying a negative variance of 45%. Despite this shortfall, we have been able to fully pay salaries and service 100% of our debt. We have also released seven months overhead for 2018, two months for 2019, and N2.079 billion capital expenditure as at 14th May 2019. “We have adopted a prudent debt management strategy which ensures that we invest what we borrow in capital projects. Although our debt by international standards, at 19.09% Nigeria’s debt to GDP ratio is well below the threshold of 56% for countries similar to Nigeria. The government is addressing the issue of reducing the debt service to revenue through a combination of debt substitution strategies,” she said. On the issue of debt increase from N12.2 trillion to N23.0 trillion, Ahmed said it was by design. On revenue performance, however, the minister said that from all indications, the nation was faring better in 2019 than it did in 2018. Ahmed said that this indication stemmed from the oil production levels which had gone up from an average of 1.9 million barrels per day (mbpd) to 2.1 mbpd. “The comfort we have is that Egina came on stream in November 2018 and it has the capacity to produce between 150,000 and 250,000 barrels per day.“While the production volumes have not reached what was budgeted at 2.3 mbpd, the average crude oil price in the global market at $71 per barrel is helping us to balance the shortfall because our budget was put at $60 per barrel.” Meanwhile, Ms Patience Oniha, the Director-General, Debt Management Office (DMO) said the 30-year bond that was introduced in April was for the benefit of the Federal Government as it would help in managing liabilities and financing infrastructure. She added that it was also to encourage the private sector to support economic growth and issue securities in the tenor the government had done. Mr. Isyaku Tilde, acting Executive Commissioner, Operations, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said multiple applications were affecting the quantum of unclaimed dividends and even the liquidity in the market. He said that the issue of multiple applications came about between 2005 and 2008 in the boom period in the capital market and subscribers used different names to purchase shares which made it difficult to consolidate the two accounts because the names were not the same.
