Like a scene from the Nollywood movie, guests to the venue of a wedding ceremony were kidnapped on Auga-Ise Akoko Road in Akoko North-East Local Government Area of Ondo State at the weekend. Sources said two vehicles – a Toyota Corolla car and a Mishubushi pick-up van – going for a wedding ceremony at Ikare-Akoko were waylaid by gunmen and abducted three of the guests. Residents said kidnapping in Auga-Ise area of Akoko North-East Local Government Area, which reduced when some of the kidnappers were arrested in Edo State recently, has resurfaced with the kidnapping of the wedding guests. A source said a family was travelling in the Corolla car when the head of the family was kidnapped while the hoodlums released the wife and his two children to go and look for ransom. The source said the men were abducted on the same spot where Olori Agunloye, the Alauga of Auga and her driver, were kidnapped last year. The source added that the police in Ikare, in conjunction with vigilantes, had swung into action by combing the bush to rescue the victims and arrest the criminals. In his reaction, the Alauga of Auga, Oba Samuel Agunloye, said to eliminate or reduce the menace, there must be an Army formation a police outpost in the area. The monarch disclosed that Ipele-Isua Auga-Akunu-Kabba federal highway needed to be rehabilitated for free flow of vehicles. At press time, no family had been contacted for negotiations. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr. Femi Joseph, said investigation had begun to arrest the hoodlums and secure the release of the captives.
