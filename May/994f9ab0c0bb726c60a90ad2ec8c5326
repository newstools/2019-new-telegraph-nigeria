While media personality, Toke Makinwa, might be happy with the results from her Brazilian Bu*t Lift (BBL) surgery, some people still find her and other celebrities who have gone under the knife to enhance their body features to be going against certain moral standards and religious commandments. Recently, Nigerian actor, Richard Mofe Damijo criticised women who are going under the knife to alter their body. He stated that a woman who is truly secure would not go under the knife just to get validation from others. While some agree with him, Toke Makinwa seems to be unhappy about his stance. Although,she didn’t outrightly speak against him, Makinwa appeared to be throwing shades when she insinuated that it is no one’s business what people choose to do with their bodies. In her post, she adviced that people should judge less and mind their business. Bleaching expert, Dencia took a more direct stab at the words of RMD when she shared a post heavily crticising his right to address such issue. Meanwhile, a Twitter user identified as Otto Orondaam has shared a long thread on a rather interesting subject matter. In a series of post Orondaam made a case for women getting plastic surgery and those who spend hours in the gym to get their desired result.According to Otto there is no major difference between such two women as most times, they lay on the edge of suffering similar consequences. In his post, he insinuated that women who see a surgeon to fix them and those who go to the gym are chasing the same goal and should both not be judged. Otto’s ultimate message was that people should learn to respect people’s choices and judge less.
