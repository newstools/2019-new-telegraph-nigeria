A group, Arewa Online Publishers Forum, yesterday said it has concluded arrangements to honour the Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Yakubu Dogara, with special media awards. The forum in a statement in Kaduna said: “The Senate President would be honoured with Arewa Online Publishers Forum’s Exemplary Leadership Award while the Speaker is to be honoured for Purposeful and Transparent Leadership.” The statement signed by Chairman of the forum, Mordecai Ibrahim, said others to be honoured include; “Senators Magnus Abe, APC, Rivers South-East; Shehu Sani, PRP, Kaduna Central and Kabir Marafa, APC, Zamfara Central.” The statement also said in part; “The awardees were unanimously selected on merit at the last Annual General Congress of Arewa Online Publishers Forum for their loyalty and commitment. “Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki and Rt. Hon. Yakubu Dogara are being honoured specifically for providing decisive, purposeful and effective leadership that helped check the excesses of the executive arm from turning Nigeria’s fragile democracy into a dictatorship.
“Notwithstanding the distractions, the leadership of both chambers provided quality leadership that culminated in landmark legislations, which made the 8th Senate and the House of Representatives the most productive since 1999.” “For example, the Senate passed an unprecedented 213 bills, the highest since 1999. The bills included the Petroleum Industry Bill; Not Too Young to Run Bill (now an Act); Electoral Act Amendment Bill; National Housing Fund Bill, and the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria Bill 2018, among others. There is no doubt that these will impact positively on Nigerians in the near future.”
