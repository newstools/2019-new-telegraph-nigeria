Former Super Eagles forward, Nwankwo Kanu, has given a pat on the back to the Chief Executive Officer of Monimichelle, Ebi Egbe.
Nwankwo who spoke during the Gov Akinwumi Ambode thank you game played at the Agege soccer temple described Egbe’s firm as Africa’s leading stadium construction outfit, even as he urged federal and state governments to partner with him to change the face of Nigerian football pitches.
“Monimichelle is simply number one in Africa. I m proud of him and what he is doing to change the face of our stadiums. His jobs are world-class and I will want him to be given the job of re grassing the National Stadium pitches in Abuja and Lagos so that Eagles can return to their traditional home,” Kanu said.
Kanu in the African legends versus Naija Legends game was his old self as he dazzled fans to the best of football with some fans jokingly recommending that Rohr should take him and the trio of Austin Jay Jay Okocha, Emma Amuneke and Garba Lawal to the Egypt 2019 Nations Cup.
After scoring Naija Legends opener in the 4-4 thriller, the commentator described his combination with Jay Jay as “Network that never fails.”
It could be recalled that Monimichelle handled the Enyimba Stadium Aba, the Samson Siasia Stadium pitch as well as the Aper Aku stadium Makurdi and Karkanda Stadium, Katsina pitches. The Onikan Stadium pitch in Lagos is at the moment being re grassed by Monimichelle.
