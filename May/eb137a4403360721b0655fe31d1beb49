The former Super Eagles player and the assistant coach of Golden Eaglets, Nduka Ugbade, says Nigeria can win the 2019 African Cup of Nations slated for Egypt next month. Fresh from picking the FIFA U-17 World Cup ticket with the Golden Eaglets in Tanzania, Ugbade declared that the Eagles had the right calibre of players to win the Nations Cup if they are determined to fight for the trophy. He said: “I believe strongly with a good, fearless performance they can smile home with the trophy. They have got a mixture of young, vibrant and experienced players in the team. “The likes of Kenneth Omeruo, Ahmed Musa, Mikel Obi, who have won this tournament before will be the players needed to carry the responsibility for the team. “The young ones like Wilfred Ndidi, Alex Iwobi, and Shehu Abdullahi will complement the efforts of the experienced players in the team.” Ugbade who also spoke about his team’s qualification for the U-17 World Cup in Brazil, insisted that clinching the World Cup ticket was the first priority in Tanzania. Ugbade urged Nigerians not to lose hope in the team, that the Golden Eaglets would be a better team at the World Cup.
