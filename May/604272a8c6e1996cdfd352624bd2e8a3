Speaking at a news conference to mark its 30th anniversary, the Chief Executive Officer, Eterna, Mahmud Tukur, said downstream deregulation is long overdue although a very political and sensitive issue, it has rather become imperative for industry growth.  Although commending the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) for their efforts on availability of products, he noted that supply is fraught with challenges and associated cost. “Let’s stop wasting money on subsidies,” he said. Speaking further, Tukur said Eterna’s five-year strategic plan focuses on three major areas – oil, lubricants and other new businesses, adding that despite the environment challenges the company is looking forward to acquiring additional 200 filling stations within the plan period.  He said apart from lubricant, which is Eterna’s mainstay, venturing into retail stations is part of the new focus, to be contracted through franchising, leasing, and acquisition, to double available capacity. “We are not just acquiring stations; we are also getting strategic locations, where we can get value for money.”  He however, expressed disappointment in supply inequality in the market, and accused NNPC of servicing mainly the majors and big names, which guarantees products availability to consumers.
