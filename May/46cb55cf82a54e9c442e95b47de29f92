Worried by the alarming rate of human trafficking and migration of Edo State citizens to Libya for greener pasture, the Special Adviser to Governor on Gender Issues, Ms. Efosa Uyigue, has expressed confidence that the state government’s initiative in resuscitating adult education centres across the state will reduce the incidence of girl-child trafficking in the state. Uyigue disclosed this during the flag-off of the sensitisation campaign on girl-child education in Esan North East and Esan West Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the state. “I am impressed with the turn-out of women for the campaign, and their enthusiasm to learn is very encouraging. This shows how eager the women are, as if they have been waiting for the opportunity to acquire education,” he added, commending the chairmen of the local government councils for their commitment and support to the state government in resuscitating adult education learning centres in their council areas. While applauding the huge turnout, she pointed out that the establishment of the adult learning centres would translate to improved education outcomes. Uyigue said the campaign would encourage more girls from rural areas to enroll in the free adult education centres for them to acquire knowledge and education that would guide them against the lure and antics of human traffickers. Meanwhile, the Chairman, Esan West LGA, Patrick Aguinede, in his remarks, reiterated his administration’s commitment to the objectives of the initiative by improving the standard of the centres in the council area.
