Those who described politics as a game of interest masquerading as a contest of principles cannot be far from the truth given what is playing out in one of the federal constituencies in Imo State, where two friends are present at each other throat over failed political ambitions.  The duo were said to have reached a deal to vie for the respective tickets of two different political parties for the House of Representatives election with a caveat that whoever gets the ticket of any of the leading parties will get the support of the other.  As fate would have it, both secured the tickets of their respective parties, but none was ready to step down. They went into to election, but lost to the candidate of a relatively unknown party. Consequently, the once jolly good friends, now have a cat and mouse relationship even as they mourn their losses.
