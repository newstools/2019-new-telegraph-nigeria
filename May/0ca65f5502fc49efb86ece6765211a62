At least 13 local government chairmen and 171 Ward Councillors in Ebonyi state have rejected council autonomy. They unanimously rejected the position of the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) on Local Government Finances. This was contained in a 10-point resolution endorsed by the chairmen and another similar resolution signed by the Legislative leaders of the Local Governments and made available to the state House of Assembly for affirmation. Other contents of the resolution were local government contribution for the funding of Ebonyi State University and funding of the sixty-four development centers of the state among others. The council chairmen stormed the State House of Assembly alongside their ward councilors to affirm their position having signed the ten-point resolution against the position of the Nigerian Financial Intelligence unit on Local Government Finances. The Council Chairmen said their decision was to promote good governance at the grassroots level and restore efficient administration at the local government areas. The grass root leaders maintained that a central e-salary payment platform for monthly payment of salaries and pension of Local Government Staff as first line charges should be upheld, affirming that the joint state and local government projects should be maintained in accordance with the Ebonyi State and Local Government joint project and related matters amendment law NO 007 of 2015. Other contents of the resolution were local government contribution for the funding of Ebonyi State University and funding of the sixty-four development centers of the State among others.
