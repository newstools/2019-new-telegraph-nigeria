Former President Goodluck Jonathan has again denied allegations of massive looting of the public treasury during his tenure. Jonathan stated this yesterday, at the Third Session of the 10th Synod of the Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion, held at St. Mathewâ€™s Church, Gwarinpa Estate, Abuja. He said the allegations were deliberately designed by some persons and interest groups to smear his name and that of the government he presided over. He wondered how the quantum of funds allegedly taken from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) could have been moved by anybody. Jonathan expressed regret over the rising insecurity across Nigeria and urged Nigerians to pray and support the Federal Government to overcome the spate of kidnapping, terrorism and banditry in the country.
