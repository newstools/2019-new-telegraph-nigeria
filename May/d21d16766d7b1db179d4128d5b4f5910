Ex-international, Joseph Dosu, has said the Super Eagles have what it takes to emerge winners of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations which kicks off next month in Egypt. Dosu, who was in the Nigerian team that won the Atlanta 1996 Olympics gold medal, told our correspondent in a telephone conversation that with the quality of players in the team they could match any side in the charge for the diadem. Dosu, who was forced into early retirement after a car accident on the very night he helped Nigeria qualify for France ’98 World Cup, said if the form being displayed by many of the Eagles’ stars at their clubs currently was anything to go by, the team could become the most successful sides at Egypt 2019. The former Julius Berger FC of Lagos and Igbobi College graduate who is now a successful players’ representative, however, added that the Eagles required proper preparations and discipline to excel. Dosu stated: “We have a good team; there is quality in the set of players that we have at the moment and they can get to the final in Egypt and even win the cup. “However, we also have to note that other countries that have qualified also want to win the trophy. So, it will be all about how prepared we are. It has to be about having the best plan and good preparations before going to the competition. “All our players are doing well with their clubs and winning trophies, like Henry Onyekuru and Victor Osiemhen who are on top of their game right now. They are young and ready to go. “They are ready to play well and win, but it has to be about getting good preparations as well.” Asked if Super Eagles can win the trophy he quipped? Yes we can.” .
