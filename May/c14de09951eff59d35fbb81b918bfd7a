New banking clients, increasing wealth in developing areas, drive card market growth  Despite near ubiquitous global uptake of the Europay, Mastercard Visa (EMV) standard, several key factors are stimulating the payment cards market such that ABI Research, a market advisory firm, is projecting that EMV payment card issuance will increase from 3.18 billion in 2019 to more than 3.75 billion by 2023.  Adopted by the Nigerian banking industry in 2009, a development, which resulted in a drastic reduction in card fraud, EMV cards are smart cards that store their data on integrated circuits in addition to magnetic stripes. In a press release, the firm identified new banking clients, increasing wealth in developing areas, contactless migration, new innovations in card form factors, such as metal cards, and powered payment cards that incorporate biometric sensor technology, as some of the factors driving EMV payment card issuance.  Interestingly, between 2017 and 2018, contactless migration slowed significantly, driven by stagnation in China, a key contactless market. However, other regional markets are set to reverse the decline in 2019, ABI said.  “A significant push by the Reserve Bank of India, such as the release of contactless tokenization guidelines, and India’s Finance Ministry advising banks and financial institutions to begin issuing contactless-enabled credit and debit cards have already paid dividends,” ABI Research Director Phil Sealy said. “The Indian market reacted well, particularly in Q4 2018, where it was estimated that near 10 percent of all cards issued were of the contactless variety.”  In the U.S., migration to contactless is currently underway. This momentum is expected to continue, with U.S. issuers likely adopting a targeted approach for contactless migration, for instance, timing card migration in New York with migration of the city’s transit system to accept open-loop payment credentials.
