No fewer than four people have been killed following fresh communal strife between the Okpudu and Ollo communities of Okpowku local government area of Benue State. New Telegraph gathered that the crisis began following a misunderstanding between some youths of the two communities which resulted in the abduction of two Okpudu youths by some Ollo youths last Sunday evening. Scores of residents including women and children have fled the troubled communities just as a local vigilante has taken over major roads leading in and outside the two communities to forestall any form of reprisals. It was gathered that the clashes which dates back many years began following discord between some youths of the two communities which resulted in the abduction of two Okpudu youths by some Ollo youths. A source from the community who pleaded anonymity said at about 5 pm last Sunday, some Ollo youths who dressed in military uniforms and armed with guns had stormed Okpudu community on motorcycles and ordered two youths of the community to follow them. The source noted that when the abducted Okpudu youths were still not seen 24 hours after, Okpudu youths mobilized and stormed Ollo community to demand for their release. However, in the ensuing fracas, four persons were reportedly killed with some others injured. Our source disclosed that the Okpudu youths stormed Ollo community because a similar scenario happened a few years back when two youths of the community who were abducted by Ollo youths, were later killed and buried in a shallow grave. However, a few hours after Okpudu youths stormed Ollo, it was gathered that the Okpudu youths who were earlier abducted on Sunday were released after they were thoroughly beaten with wounds all over their bodies. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Catherine Anene confirmed the incident. DSP Anene said the squabbles came as a result of a long-standing marriage difference between the warring sides.
