 After a successful showing of Ireti, a play written and directed by Oluwasogba Sam Tayo (a.k.a. Ijotayor), for the first edition of “Theatre in the Mainland” (Surulere in focus), a bimonthly art project initiated by Whitestones Culture Ambassadors Nigeria, the stage is set for the stage presentation of the play, The Victim, for the second edition of the project. The event will hold at Villa Jazzmatazz, 3, Ogunlana Lane, Surulere, Lagos, in June.  Theatre in the Mainland was created by Oluwasogba Sam Tayo, the artistic director and C.E.O of Whitestones Culture Ambassadors Nigeria, to promote arts and theatre on the mainland.  Ireti featured array of talented actors such as Eden Attai, Humphery Gabriel, Adedotun Emmanuel, Madufor Adeeze, Campbell Oluwatosin, Okunade Oluwabunmi, Mayor Onuwa, Sodiq Ogabi, Henry Ihiemere, Obi Emmanuel, Roseline Fadairo, Mary Samuel, Akinseye Victoria, and six years old Oluwasogba Bernice. The play in context speaks about tradition, believe, love disappointment and hatred, through which love prevailed in the end.  On the idea behind Theatre in the Mainland, Tayo said: “Since every work of art is now taken to the island, there is a need to create an avenue for people on the Mainland to enjoy the same or even better quality of drama they over stressed themselves to see on the island. This doesn’t mean that we are against theatre in the island but the good thing is that we (the Mainlanders)are always the one working in those project, and this has spite our interest ti return the art back to Surulere where it all began, it is never too late to renew our strength
The next edition will come up in June and we will be staging The Victim, a play also written and directed by Oluwasogba Sam Tayo (a.k.a. Ijotayor).  The Victim, according to Tayo, is a story of reality. “The Victim enlightens and educates the youth/young adult about the danger of fallen in love, the heart broken and need for forgiveness,” he said.
