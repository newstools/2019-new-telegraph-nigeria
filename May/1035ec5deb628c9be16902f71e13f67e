…unhappy over skipper’s attitude  The Nigeria Football Federation is not happy about the insistence of the Super Eagles Manager Gernot Rohr to have his skipper Mikel Obi in the squad for the 2019 African Cup of Nations slated to begin in Egypt next month. Mikel has not played for Nigeria since the last 2018 FIFA World Cup, missing the entire Nations Cup qualifiers, fuelling speculations that the former Chelsea midfielder might have called time on his international career. The Middlesbrough midfielder met with Rohr at the weekend where he pledged to be part of the squad for the Nations Cup which could be his swansong. However, our correspondent learnt that the German tactician had to do so much to convince the hierarchy of the NFF to have the midfielder back in the squad. A member of the NFF Reforms Committee, Osasu Obayiuwana, revealed on his tweeter handle that the federation’s chieftains felt the presence of the 32-year-old combative midfielder could be disruptive. “A top NFF official, in a frank “off-the-record” discussion with me wondered if it wouldn’t be disruptive for Mikel to return, after being absent from the team for a year,”Obayiuwana tweeted.
“He was critical of Mikel’s attitude, to his colleagues and officials, during his self-imposed absence.” Our correspondent learnt that the NFF had wanted Ahmed Musa to continue as the captain of the team because they were impressed with the player’s way of handling situation concerning the squad. New Telegraph learnt that the NFF believed the former Tianjin Teda star could pose a problem in negotiation regarding the players’ bonuses and other emolument while Musa would be more flexible.
Obayiuwana, in his tweets confirmed the captaincy issue. “But the decision to include Mikel – and whether he’ll regain the captain’s band – is purely down to the Super Eagles Head Coach, Gernot Rohr, who is expected to name his 26-man AFCON preliminary squad this week.”
