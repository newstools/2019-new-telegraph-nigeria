Coach of Safety Shooters and Safety Babes, Bala Mohammed, whose teams currently top the Prudent Energy Handball League table has said tactical discipline has shot his sides to the top.
The Safety Shooters and Babes have won all the seven games they have played so far in the league with convincing displays and have become the favourites to lift the title after the second phase in Lagos in September.
Mohammed, who spoke at the venue of the first phase of the league in Abuja yesterday, stated that his players had been able to stick to the tactical plans of the coaching crew. He stated that the entire team was happy for the progress they have made in the competition.
He also stated that being able to train together during the off-season has molded the teams into a strong unit. “It is a blessing that all the players (including the newly-employed ones) in the team are based in Abuja and that gave us enough time together.
“We (the technical crew) must also commend the players for sticking to the game plans always and we also thank God for crowning the efforts we put into our games with victories,” he added.
The coach noted that his involvement with the national team and the technical tips from Rafiu Salami, who is based in France, had helped him imbibe the modern way of coaching the game. “It is a privilege to coach the national team which has helped me with knowing the modern technique of coaching the game.
“When you go for competitions, I get to see various style, which I also build into my coaching and I am delighted that my players have also absorbed most of the technique have handed down to them during trainings,” he added.
