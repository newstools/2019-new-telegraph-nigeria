The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) is collaborating with security agencies to undertake background checks of all personnel working in the nation’s airports.
Mr Saleh Dunoma, Managing Director of FAAN said the move was part of the new security measures to bring sanity to airports.
According to him, the recent incident at Aminu Kano International Airport that led to wrongful arrest of an innocent Nigerian in Saudi Arabia was unfortunate.
“It is very unfortunate that the incident happened and we found ourselves in this but we have gotten to the root of that.
“I attended meetings personally in Kano on three occasions when this saga is going on and we have reviewed the total security architecture in Kano and from that review, we have implemented over 80 per cent.
“We have also introduced certain things in order to check the people that are working at the airport.
“Everybody that is working at the airport, whether you are FAAN staff, NAHCON staff, SAHCOL staff, airline staff because these are people that interact with passengers and we have agreed that everybody must go through background check.
“These background checks would be carried out by the appropriate security agencies in this country and then if they find anything doubtful about your character or anything about you we do away with you, “he said. “But there are a host of other things I don’t want to mention here that we have put in place in order to make sure that we curtail the situation.” Dunoma, who spoke in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), assured that the authority had also introduced new measures to airport security, adding that new equipment had been provided to assist in curbing the human issues within airports. He said that the effort led to the arrest of the culprits in the Kano saga, saying that no effort would be spared to rid the airports of bad eggs.
