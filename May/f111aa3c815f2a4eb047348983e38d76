Adamawa State Governor, Muhammad Umar Jibrilla, yesterday said he would be the first governor in the country to pay the approved N30, 000 minimum wage to civil servants. Jibrilla stated this in Yola on the occasion of the 2019 Workers’ Day celebration held at Mahmud Ribadu Square, Yola.  The governor explained that his administration, from the inception, had not owed workers’ salaries, stressing also that; “My priority as governor was to ensure that workers’ salaries are paid up to date as well as ensure the needed developmental strides in the state.”  He called on the incoming administration to, as a matter of necessity, work in consonance with labour leaders for better government-labour relations.  The governor, however, denied borrowing N150 million for any capital projects in the state. He said: “I have never borrowed any money for such purposes. “I have never borrowed any money for the services of capital projects, I only took overdraft to augment the payment of workers’ salaries,” he said.  Also speaking, Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in the state, Emmanuel Fashe, said “organised labour in the state is anxiously waiting for the implementation of the N30,000 new minimum wage as signed into law by the President and Commander -in-Chief.”
