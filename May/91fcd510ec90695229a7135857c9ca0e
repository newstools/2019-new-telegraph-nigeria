United States-based Nigerian former athlete, Victor Okorie, has lamented the death of his mother, Marie Okorie, who will be committed to mother earth on Saturday May 25, in Achara-Ihechiowa, Arochukwu Local Government in Abia State. The hurdler who rose from the school sports system to rule the National Sports Festival where he won a back-to-back title in the 400m hurdles at Imo 1998 and Bauchi 2000, said he is going to miss his mother who supported him during his career as an athlete. Speaking from his United States base, Victor Okorie, who won a silver medal for Team Nigeria at COJA 2003 All Africa Games in Abuja said: “My mother gave me the courage and support to go to University in the United States. “She gave me the chance to be able to win all the accolades as an athlete, which include an All Africa Games silver medal, All Nigerian Athletics Championships, World Championships, Conference champion in the US and All-American track championship.” Okorie was one of the athletes discovered by renowned athletics coach Tobias Igwe. He ruled the Nigerian track before relocating to the United States, where he rose to become the most sought after foreign athlete, especially in the Collegiate Games.
