Police in Edo State said they had rescued a two-yearold girl, Christabel Omokpia, who was sold for N850,000. Christabel was allegedly sold in Enugu State by an orphanage in Rivers State. She was said to be two years old when she and her sister, Amanda, were stolen. Both sisters were stolen at Utesi village in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State by two female tenants of their father in June 2018. The girls were stolen after their mother, Mrs. Faith, left them in the care of the two female tenants, Mary and Rose. The ladies later disappeared with the children. C h r i s t ab e l was first sold for N450,000 and later resold for N500,000 to Ogechi Favour. She was reportedly sold again for N850,000 to Anioke Augustine in Enugu State. A relation of Christabel, identified as Beauty, said that the family was happy to get her back. Beauty, however, expressed worry that Christabel couldn’t recognise her parents again. Sources close to the state police command said she was reunited with her family on Wednesday night. One of the sources said Anioke adopted Christabel without due process. The Edo State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Chidi Nwabuzor, said it was the Edo State Commissioner of Police, Danmallam Abubakar, who ordered the rescue of the child. He said: “The search for Christabel took police operatives from Benin to Delta, Anambra, River, Imo and Enugu states. Four suspects, earlier arrested in connection with the missing children, were already in prisons in Ondo and Edo states. “We are also doing everything possible to rescue Amanda. Our investigations showed that the woman who bought Amanda took her to Ogwas-Chikwu in Delta State.”
