Comedian and actor, Ayo Makun, better known as AY, has urged Nigerians to stop equating being famous with being wealthy. According to AY, who is also a filmmaker, it is often a misconception to assume that a famous celebrity is wealthy.
In an Instagram post on Thursday, the 47-year-old producer of 30 days in Atlanta among other successful movies, made this known, trying to educate his fans and followers about secrets of the entertainment industry.
“SHOWBIZ SECRETS 101. Being famous is mostly mistaken for serious wealth and riches by the people around entertainers. The more reason they always get DMs from fans, or calls from friends and family asking for one (form of) assistance or the other on a daily basis,” AY, who has hardly been shy about offering his thoughts on the state of the entertainment industry, began.
While emphasizing that the terrain comes with high maintenance and that cleebs are caught in the web of needing help like everyone else, AY wrote further: “Popularity is not an accurate measurement of a man’s worth in the showbiz. Many entertainers are like mannequins who sample your dream lives for your entertainment pleasure. So always look beyond the cars they drive in the movies, the beautiful houses in the music videos, and all the expensive clothes that they put on to give you a perfect television picture. They are 100% human with high maintenance realities that must match what you see on the big screen. WE NEED HELP TOO.”
