The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) has decried spate of vandalism on its tracks in the Eastern District by hoodlums, saying that it hampered development and operation of the rail system in the zone.  Managing Director of the Corporation, Fidet Okhiria, who spoke weekend while commissioning a newly rehabilitated railway hospital in Enugu, by Governance Infrastructure Business Transparency Consultancy, GIBC Digital, said that the country would only have meaningful development when state capitals and industrial zones were linked with rail.  He, however, regretted that while government was looking for fund to borrow to rehabilitate railway system to grow the economy, people were busy vandalizing it.  Okhiria, while fielding questions from journalists on while the Enugu to Port-Harcourt train was grounded, said “the reason while the Eastern corridor was not functional is due to vandalism of tracks by hoodlums.  Okhiria went on: “Can you margin people removing and vandalizing the rail how would we run the train because we have to go back, recover those things and put the track back?  If an accident happened and we lost a locomotive where am I going to get locomotive again, a locomotive is over $4 million. So, if because of people vandalizing the track and train capsized and a locomotive is affected are you going to take from where to function the train from where they vandalize the track? Anything we do there is always a fallout from that. “The tracks, cables that supply power to the workshop and crane lifting locomotive in the workshop were all vandalized
