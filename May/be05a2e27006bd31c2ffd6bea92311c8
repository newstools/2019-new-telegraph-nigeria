Standard Bank and South Africa’s African Bank have inaugurated low-fee, digital accounts in a sign of how competition from a new breed of cheaper, online-only rivals is driving change in the $30 billion financial service market.  The new accounts from the two lenders are the latest disruption to a market largely dominated by four big players Absa, FirstRand as well as Nedbank and Standard Bank.  Basani Maluleke, the CEO of African Bank, said: “The introduction of “MyWORLD” has elevated African Bank to a digital retail bank, offering a variety of products including transactional banking, personal loans as well as savings, investments and insurance.”  “Our increased and diversified product offering, underpinned by our Omni-channel platform, will enable us to compete favourably against the established and emerging banks,” said Maluleke. Similarly, Standard Bank soft-launched its lowest-fee account, MyMo, which cost ZAR 4.95 per month and offering clients free mobile data or air time for transactions. In a statement, African Bank said that MyWORLD has accumulated 12,000 users since its soft launch in mid-February.
