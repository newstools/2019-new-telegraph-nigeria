Aggrieved youths in Niger State have vowed to emulate their Niger Delta counterparts by grounding activities of the three hydroelectric power dams in the state if power supply to the state was not improved.  The youth in directing their anger at the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC), reeled out their demands at a town hall meeting on; ‘Epileptic Power Supply, Prepaid Meters: The Way Forward,’ organised by the state government’s committee on AEDC monitoring and sensitisation, vowed that; “If power supply does not increase to at least 18 hours per day, we would do what our brothers in the Niger Delta did and are enjoying amnesty today. We will shut down the dams and seek for amnesty too.”  In his remarks at the town hall meeting, Niger State Deputy Governor  Alhaji Mohammed Ketso, accused the AEDC of intentionally denying the state electricity supply. He added that the state would not support the agitation for the people to pay electricity bills when AEDC was not supplying electricity to the state.   According to Ketso; “The state can no longer rely on the promises of AEDC, which they do not intend to keep. “It is an intentional act that AEDC is not supplying us in Niger State with electricity. You are not giving us light and you want us to support you, it is not possible.  “We cannot support what you are doing to our people. You keep promising and doing nothing, we cannot keep going back and front. Please AEDC, we need light, once you make light available to us, we can assure you that our people will pay their bills.   “But the random light you give to us with estimated billings, we will not pay. Give our people what they deserve. Give us electricity, at least 13 to 14 hours daily.” Earlier in his explanation, AEDC General Manager, Corporate Communications, Ogebode Fadikpe, appealed for understanding from the government and the people, saying that the amount of energy allocated to them was not enough for the states they serve.
