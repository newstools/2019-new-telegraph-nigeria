Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) yesterday said it has discovered more than 215 abandoned buildings within the Federal Capital City (FCC), mostly located in highbrow areas of Asokoro and Maitama districts of the city.  It also said about 95 uncompleted buildings, 879 vacant plots, six without approval and 739 plots duly allocated would be reviewed according to the law of the territory.   Executive Secretary, Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA), Umar Jibrin, who disclosed this after the weekly FCTA executive council meeting in Abuja, said the review and demolition exercise would be carried out in line with the laws that established the FCTA, and would not be targeted at individuals, but would ensure sanity within the area. Jibrin also stated that all abandoned and uncompleted buildings, parks and event centres existing in the capital would be subjected to review.  He said most of the structures built in the city centre contravened the Abuja Master Plan, which must be pulled down after necessary procedures had been followed.   Jibrin noted that the decision followed the resolutions of FCT Executive Council meeting with the Minister, Malam Muhammad Bello, in attendance.  “There were over 215 abandoned buildings, 95 uncompleted, 879 vacant plots, six without approval and 739 plots duly allocated,” he explained. He said 15 plots had been revoked, ten withdrawn with 114 having no records, which the executive described as a security threat
