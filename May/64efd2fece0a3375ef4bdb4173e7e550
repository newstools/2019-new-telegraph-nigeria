Nigeria sprint queen, Blessing Okagbare- Ighoteguonor is returning to the Shanghai IAAF Diamond League meeting on Saturday four years after she last competed at the Shanghai Stadium. The Nigerian’s last visit in 2015 was a hugely successful one as she won the 100m in 10.98 seconds ahead of USA’s Tori Bowie (11.07) and Trinidad and Tobago’s Michelle-Lee Ahye (11.13). On Saturday, she will hope to put up a better performance than the 23.14 seconds she ran over the 200m in Doha last week as she battles 2016 double Olympic sprint champions,Elaine Thompson of Jamaica,two-time USA champion at 200m (2015, 2018) and 2015 NCAA Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships over the 100m,Jenna Prandini and Michelle-Lee,the 2018 Commonwealth Games 100m champion for the $10,000 top prize money and the eight points on offer. Okagbare’s record at the Shanghai Diamond League, the second stop on the International Association of Athletics Federations’ global circuit of premier one-day meetings has been impressive in all her five visits so far.
