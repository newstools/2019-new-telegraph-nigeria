The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has denied arresting the former Governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, following his official handover to his successor, Emeka Ihedioha, on Wednesday. Reports began to circulate online on Thursday that he had been arrested by the EFCC. EFCC’s acting Head, Media and Publicity, Tony Orilade, he said, “It is fake news.” “We don’t investigate the source of disinformation. We investigate financial and economic crimes. So, if anybody is quoting us, we can then take it up,” he told a national daily.
