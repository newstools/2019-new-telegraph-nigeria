Except Gen. Yakubu Gowon (rtd.), almost all former Nigerian leaders were absent at the swearing-in of President Muhammadu Buhari for a second term in office yesterday. Conspicuously absent at the event, which was held at Eagle Square, Abuja, were the immediate former president, Goodluck Jonathan, his predecessor, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, as well as the two former military rulers, Ibrahim Babangida and Abdulsalami Abubakar. Former Chief of Army Staff, Gen. Theophilus Danjuma was also absent. The seats reserved for them at the State Box were vacant during the ceremony. Though the presidency said the presidential inauguration would be low keyed, no reason was given for their absence. A little drama, however, played out when the embattled National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress APC) Adams Oshiomhole, who made his way in between the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) and Service Chiefs, during the guard of honour, was walked about to take his seat. Security was tight as movements to the inauguration venue were restricted. Traffic to the Federal Secretariat was diverted, while there were dedicated places for car parks from there, guests were taken to the Eagle Square in accredited buses
