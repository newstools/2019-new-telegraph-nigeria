Justice Musa Kurya of a Jos Federal High Court has excused himself from a certificate forgery suit against a Plateau lawmaker, Hon. Ibrahim Baba-Hassan. Baba-Hassan, representing Jos North Constituency at the State House of Assembly, had through a motion by his lawyer, Mr. Solomon Umoh (SAN) urged the judge to excuse himself from the case having earlier delivered judgment against him in a sister case.  Kurya, had in a 2015 pre-election matter, filed against Baba-Hassan by Mr. Abdu Saleh, also of APC, pronounced the lawmaker guilty of forging University of Jos’ Diploma Certificate in Business Administration.  When the suit filed by the Federal Government against the lawmaker came up for hearing, Umoh told the court that he was challenging the sincerity and moral justification of the judge in handling the case.  Umoh said: “Since you have given judgment against my client on the sister case, we have lost confidence in you and pray to your lordship to excuse yourself from this very case.’’ “This is the position of the law. Once you have given judgment on a sister or related case, you cannot be the one to continue with the other.  “So, we are applying to your Lordship to honourably step aside in this matter and let your other brother, or any other judge, handle this case in the interest of justice.’’ Mr Una Mathew-Udu, the prosecuting counsel, did not object to the application.  Justice Kurya, however, announced his decision to step aside and excused himself from the criminal case leveled against the lawmaker. “In the interest of justice, I hereby excuse myself from this forgery suit against the defendant by the Federal Government,’’ Kurya declared.
