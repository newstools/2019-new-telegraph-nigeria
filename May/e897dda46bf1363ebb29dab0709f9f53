Outgoing governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, yesterday handed over a brand new Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) and four trucks containing four million rounds of ammunition to the state Commissioner of Police, Bashir Makama.
He also handed over 1,000 bullet proof vests and 1,000 AK 47 rifles to the police boss.
State Director, Department of State Services (DSS), Mr. David Tuksa, witnessed the ceremony. Speaking before he was officially pulled out at the Governor’s Office, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, Amosun said the security gadgets were kept safe in armoury at the Government House to avoid being taken away for illegal use. He explained that the APC, which is the 15th among those earlier purchased by his administration, was initially seized at the port and after being released, he decided to keep it safe and hand it over to security agencies upon his exit from power.
The outgoing governor justified his administration’s investment in security, saying it was to address prevailing security challenges in the state upon assumption of office. After receiving the security gadgets, the police commissioner thanked Amosun for his kind gesture. Makama restated the commitment of the police command to protecting the lives and property of residents of the state.
