The funds have since been received by the government and are currently deposited with Central Bank of Nigeria. “The Commercial Court in the UK recently ordered to pay out the sum of over $73 million, with interest to the Nigerian Government, being part of the proceeds from the sale of OPL 245 by Malabu Oil and Gas Company to EN/SHELL.

Improving the security situation in Nigeria is top government priority”.
