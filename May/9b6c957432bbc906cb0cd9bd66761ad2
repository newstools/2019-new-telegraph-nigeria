…tackle Mali in final group match  After the 15-0 annihilation of the Niger Republic women team at the on-going West Africa Football Union B Women Cup in Abidjan, Core d’Ivoire, the Super Falcons of Nigeria will be looking forward to overcoming Mali in their final group game to top Group B of the championship. The African champions set a tournament record on Saturday evening after beating the senior women team of Niger Republic 15-0 at the Parc des Sports in Treichville, effectively sealing a place in the tournament last four. United States of America –based student, Uchenna Kanu, smashed in five of the goals, to add to the hattrick she netted in the 5-1 mauling of Burkina Faso at the same venue on Thursday. Cynthia Aku, who was named Woman-of-the-Match, got a brace, just as Rafiat Sule, while Chioma Wogu, Mary Ologbosere, Chidinma Okeke, Glory Ogbonna, Alice Ogebe and Joy Bokiri weighed with one goal each. Tuesday’s encounter with the Malians is to determine the outright winner of Group B, with Mali having earlier victimized Niger Republic 10-0 and beaten Burkina Faso 3-1 on Saturday. A draw will suffice for the Falcons to finish top of the pool. The in-form Kanu, a former junior international, who has now been listed by Coach Thomas Dennerby in the squad that will engage in the final World Cup camp in Austria as from next week, is expected to increase her tournament goals haul and also improve personal confidence ahead of the World Cup.
