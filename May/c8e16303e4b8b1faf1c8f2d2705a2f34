Charly Boy believes trouble is looming following the federal government’s decision to establish a Fulani radio station. According to Charly Boy, the federal government’s planned Fulani radio station is a time bomb waiting to happen. The veteran singer and selfacclaimed ‘Area Fada’ made this known via his Instagram page recently. According to him, all past presidents who were from different regions of the country didn’t establish any radio station from their part of the country, but it is suspicious that President Buhari has decided to set up one from his Fulani speaking region. “OBJ was President for 8 years him no set up Oduduwa radio. GEJ was President for 5 years, there was no Niger Delta radio… Buhari President, under 4 years has opened Fulani radio… Where do you think all of this is heading to. My people, these people don enter our 18. Let’s all adjust ourselves. I smell a truckload of wahala coming,” he wrote. It would be recalled that about a week ago, the Federal Government reportedly acquired an Amplitude Modulation radio broadcast licence to reach and educate herdsmen across the country. This has however been received with mixed reactions.
