Residents of Nembe, host community of Aiteo Eastern Exploration in Bayelsa State, yesterday staged a peaceful protest to register their displeasure over Operation of the OML 29 oil facilities by Aiteo multinational oil company.  The protesters, while protesting in front of the oil facility, carried placards with various inscriptions, such as “Give Nembe Light,” “Don’t misunderstand our hospitality for stupidity,” “Aiteo Nembe city demands justices,” “The land is ours,” “The oil is ours,” “Aiteo cannot operate without taking the host community along,” and that they should be treated fairly, among other demands.  In a communiqué issued by the community, the President of Nembe City Opua-sawo Itu, Elder Kwomo Ebri-egbeghabo, described Aiteo, as a faceless company without a known address. He, therefore, accused the company of outright negligence of the community despite improved production out-put, as well as non-implementation of outstanding GMOU and zero corporate social responsibility, among others.  “Aiteo produces 150,000 barrels of oil per day in the Nembe Creek Oil Field without any positive impact on the host community and asked them to relocate from the community,” the communique added. On her part, the Woman Leader of Nembe City, Madam Abigail Tariah, lamented that Aiteo Company had successfully been taken away what rightly belonged to the people for the past four years without deeming it fit to employ our children, calling for immediate vacation of their land by the oil firm
