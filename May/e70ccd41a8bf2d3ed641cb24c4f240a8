Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, is looking forward to Samuel Chukwueze doing the double for the country as the youngster is thorn between representing Nigeria at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Poland or the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. Flying Eagles coach, Paul Aigbogun, has invited the 19-year-old to the U-20 team currently in Germany for the final preparation of the team for the World Cup, while Rohr is expected to extend a call up to the Villarreal of Spain’s star ahead of the AFCON. While the U-20 World Cup is to take place in Poland from May 23 to June 15, AFCON will start six days later from June 21 in Egypt. Chukwueze has been in great form for the ‘Yellow Submarine’ this term, but the Spanish side is insisting that he should play in only one of the tournaments to avoid fatigue and injury. Rohr, who will lead the Super Eagles at the 2019 AFCON, is hopeful that a compromise can be reached for the player to be at the two tournaments. “It is a little dilemma that we must try to fix it and hopefully, there will be a good solution,” Rohr told the BBC Sport. “I understand when the club says it is impossible for him to play in the AFCON and the U-20 World Cup. “Chukwueze has good qualities and we already see why he plays at the top level in Spain. “He has an interesting ability which makes him a very important talent for any team he plays with. “I saw this quality when he played with us and the Olympic team, we must support Chukwueze and our other players too.”
