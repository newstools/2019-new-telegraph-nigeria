…demand A’Court President’s withdrawal  Staff of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, protested against the inclusion of President of Court of Appeal, Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa in the panel sitting on the petition filed by the party’s presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. The placard carrying staff members with inscriptions: “Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa: You cannot preside over your own case, your husband is a Senator-elect under APC”; “Justice is not for the most powerful, it must be seen to be rightly done”; and “On moral grounds, Justice Zainab Bulkachuwa excuse yourself from Presidential Tribunal”, called on the nation’s judiciary to stand up to its statutory responsibility as the final arbiter in disputes. They warned against the hijack of collective will of majority of Nigerians by few individuals. Chairman of PDP Staff Welfare Association, Mr. Innocent Nwankwo, who led the protest, said President of Court of Appeal, Justice Bulkachuwa, cannot chair the Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal because she is an interested party. “We, therefore, fully support the call by the National Working Committee (NWC) of our party to demand that she recuse herself immediately from the panel,” Nwankwo stated. He called on the judiciary to continue to remain on the side of the people,noting that “the judiciary is the last hope of the common man.” The workers also decried the state of insecurity in the country, blaming it on misrule of the All Progressives Congress (APC). “We are tired with the state of insecurity in the country; we are tired with the poor state of our economy; we are tired with this nepotic government; we are tired with the situation where majority of our citizens are living in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps as if we are in a state of war. Nigerians are tired,” the workers said.
