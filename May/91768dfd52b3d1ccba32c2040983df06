Makoko community, a slum in Lagos State, received a boost from a non-governmental organisation Herbert Onyewumbu Wigwe HOW Foundation, which donated medical and relief materials to them. The foundation on May 1, gave out sundry educational material to the Hope Centre School and more goodies in the form of medical materials for preventing and combating the malaria via the project tagged, ‘Give Malaria No Place (GMNP),’ which was in line with the ‘World Malaria Day’ recently celebrated across the world. The foundation, which hinted that it would soon distribute over 2,000 free mosquito nets, 4000 free medicines for preventing and curing of malaria, noted that this was in line with its resolve to sensitise the residents on the proper use of mosquito nets and proper malaria prevention habits. The Managing Director of HOW Foundation, Antonia Ally, pledged further support to the community especially the Hope Centre School. Responding to the kind gesture, the Head of Academics, Hope Centre School, Yemisi Akinode, ,thanked the NGO for the gesture and appealed to other spirited Nigerians to come to the aid of the pupils in the school. She added: “Nothing is too small. We have to support ourselves in order to get out of this predicament” The traditional ruler of the community, Baale Jeje Ayinde, also thanked the foundation for bringing such initiative to their community and told members of his community to put to practice what they were told about the malaria prevention techniques.
