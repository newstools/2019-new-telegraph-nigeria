An Accord Partyâ€™s (AP) House of Representatives- elect member, Hon. Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba has called on national leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Presidency to consider the South-East geopolitical zone for the position of the Speaker of the 9th Assembly. Nwajiuba, who was issued with the certificate of return for Okigwe South (Ehime, Mbano/Ihitte, Uboma/Obowo) federal constituency seat after defeating Hon. Chika Okafor at the tribunal, said the improvement of APC in the last elections had warranted such consideration. Speaking, Nwajiuba, who is also the chairman of TETFUND board, however, lauded the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the judiciary for retrieving his mandate. He explained how tough the contest was, as he said even though the election was conducted on 23rd February with a rerun on 9th March and final collation on 23rd March, it took this long for him to collect his certificate of return due to an earlier mistake by INEC in giving the certificate of return to a person who was adjudged by law as not being a candidate in the 2019 general election. He, however, thanked his party, the Accord Party (AP) for their support during the election and also the APC members in the South-East, especially in Okigwe South for their support even when he had to contest the election on the platform of Accord Party due to the intractable crisis in the party. Nwajiuba, who was first elected into the House of Representatives in 1999, called on the national leadership of APC to consider the South-East in the zoning of principal offices especially the speakership position considering that APC had made great progress in 2019 than in 2015 as zoning such a position to it would lead to national stability, inclusiveness and consolidation of the APC in the South-East.
