Former Burton Albion defender Kelvin Maynard has been shot and killed in Amsterdam, Dutch police have confirmed. Police said the player, 32, was shot in his car at around 8.30pm last night while driving in the Langbroekdreef area. He is believed to have attempted to escape the gunmen by driving towards a nearby fire station, according to ‘De Telegraaf’. Detectives are appealing for witnesses as they search for two suspects who they say escaped on a black scooter. The suspects were dressed in black, police said. Officers from the nearby fire station tried to help Maynard after his car crashed into the front of the building but he was unable to be resuscitated. He died two hours later of his injuries, ‘BBC Sport’ reports. The Dutch-Surinamese player, who formerly played for Royal Antwerp, was at non-league Dutch club Alphense Boys at the time of his death. Maynard joined Burton Albion in November 2014 following Dutchman Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink’s appointment as manager. Injury restricted him to 10 appearances when the club won the 2014-15 League Two title before he was ruled out by a knee injury he suffered in a pre-season game. He left Burton in January 2017 to join Dutch side Spakenbu. There were no other injuries in the shooting and nobody was hurt inside the fire station, ‘NL Times’ reports. * Courtesy: metro.co.uk
