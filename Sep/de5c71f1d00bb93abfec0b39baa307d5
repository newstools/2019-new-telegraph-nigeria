The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said that Nigeria has experienced retrogression to primordial divisions, in the last four years under the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government.
Also the Conference of United Political Parties (CUPP) regretted that the nation in bondage under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.
In separate messages Monday to mark the 59th independence anniversary of the country, PDP and CUPP, however, expressed the hope to the nation would reclaim its pride of place in comity of nations when the Supreme Court do justice to the appeal before it.
PDP said in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan that Nigeria experienced impunity, constitutional and human rights violations, assault on institutions of democracy, disobedience to court orders and electoral malpractices, in the last four years.
“In the same vein, in the last four years, our nation has been faced with the challenge of falling from being one of the fastest growing economies and home to world’s happiest people to become world’s poverty capital with a citizenry confronted by misery, insecurity, escalated violence, bloodletting, kidnapping, banditry and worsened insurgency,” the party noted.
PDP expressed optimism that the nation would overcome its challenges, and urged Nigerians to use the occasion of the independence anniversary to rekindle their commitment towards the unity, stability and development of the country, “especially as we collectively await the retrieval of our stolen presidential mandate at the Supreme Court.”
The party called on leaders at all levels to be committed and sacrificial in the discharge of their duties and desist from empty promises, rhetoric and propaganda, as Nigerians look up to them for solutions.
It urged Nigerians to keep hope alive and not surrender to despondency in the face of the excesses, impunity and recklessness of retrogressive forces in high places seeking to undermine national cohesion, freedom of citizens as guaranteed by the constitution as well as emasculate the will and aspiration of Nigerians as a people.
