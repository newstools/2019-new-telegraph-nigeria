Pauline Onyibe, Yenagoa Ahead of the Bayelsa State governorship election coming up on November 16, a non-governmental organisation, YIAGA Africa said it will deploy 500 polling unit observers to help in monitoring the conduct of the poll Already, it said, 21 long-term observers for the pre-election activates were already on ground in the state. The NGO also said it will randomly select some wards out of the 1804 wards in the state adding that it was going to use a method known as Parallel Voter Tabulation (PVT) which they believe will give them a reliable result. Speaking to the media at the weekend in Yenagoa during a workshop organised for some select journalists, YIAGA Africa, advised them to ensure accurate and timely information on the electoral process in the governorship election. Cynthia Mbamalu, the Project Director of the organisation, said the NGO was ready to partner and engage the media in the promotion of peaceful and credible elections in the state. She noted that YIAGA Africa would deploy accredited observers to all the polling units in all the local government areas of the state to provide accurate and timely information on the electoral process. “Without the media, the people will not be informed and the masses cannot hold public office holder accountable. We will ensure that the media will be informed whenever we observe any abnormalities among the political party and INEC,” she said. The Chairperson of the Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ) in Bayelsa, Marie Olodi Osuma in her speech stated that most of the observers were not always free to share information with them. The NAWOJ Chairperson appealed to them to always be open with journalists by informing them on what they have observed during and after the process of voting.
