Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel lashed out at British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday for failing to propose serious alternatives to unlock a Brexit deal before the October 31divorce date and seeking to blame the bloc for the “nightmare”.
“Don’t make the EU the bad guy,” Bettel told journalists after talks with Johnson.
Bettel was standing alone at a podium that had been prepared for comments by both leaders, but Johnson left immediately after the meeting amid loud anti-Brexit protest just outside Bettel’s office, reports Reuters.
