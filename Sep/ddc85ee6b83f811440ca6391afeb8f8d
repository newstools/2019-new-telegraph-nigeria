A rice farmer in Kano, Kano State, yesterday called on the Federal Government to sustain the current border closure in the country, saying that the measure was yielding positive results in the economy.  The farmer, who made the call at the weekend, said the policy was making great impact on home grown rice in the country.  Speaking on the impact the border closure was making on local production of rice was the Managing Director of Tiamin Rice Milling Company, Kano, Aminu Ahmed, who said already the country was witnessing several rice milling companies springing up everywhere while millions of unemployed youths were gradually being employed.  He told newsmen after a meeting in Kano that the decision to close Nigerian borders by the Federal Government was the best to give industrialists and entrepreneurs hope in the country.  Ahmed explained that about three years after the establishment of his rice milling company, he was facing challenges which he said had been surmounted after realising that Nigeria indeed needed home grown rice to survive the onslaught of foreign rice.  He said: “All these years after I established this company, no serious elite from the north showed interests in what I and others were doing, but the stand of Kano Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) has encouraged me to even expand my company.”  Ahmed explained that; ‘today with Federal Government’s intervention and support, Nigerian rice is now gradually competing favourably with foreign rice.’  For example, he said his company, which started on a very low key production, was now producing 320 tonnes daily with over 300 members of staff and 600 casual workers.   “That is why I said the border closure is working and if government sustained it in the next few years, Nigeria would be exporting its own rice after feeding it’s citizens, that is where we are heading now,” Ahmed said.
