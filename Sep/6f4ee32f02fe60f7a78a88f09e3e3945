President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday said that the unanimous judgement by the Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal over his re-election in the February 23 election was a victory for Nigerians who trooped put massively to vote. Buhari said he was unperturbed all along because he knew Nigerians freely gave him the presidential mandate. The President, in a statement shortly after the five-man tribunal sitting at the Court of Appeal in Abuja, said: “The ruling of the Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal on the February 23, 2019 poll, is victory for Nigerians who trooped out to overwhelmingly elect me for a second term in office. “Good conscience fears no evil report. I was unperturbed all along, because I knew Nigerians freely gave us the mandate. We are now vindicated.” He dedicated the victory to God, and to Nigerians, while also commending the judiciary for “dispensing justice without fear or favour.” President Buhari extended a hand of fellowship to those who had felt aggrieved at the outcome of the election and went to court, noting that it was within their democratic rights. He noted that, with the pronouncement of the judiciary, “it is time for the country to move forward as one cohesive body, putting behind us all bickering and potential distractions over an election in which Nigerians spoke clearly and resoundingly.”
