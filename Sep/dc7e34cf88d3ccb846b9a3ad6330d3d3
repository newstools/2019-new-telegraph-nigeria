…Says gov is supporting ‘illegality’ Johnchuks Onuanyim,  Abuja The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole has resumed his political war with his political godson, the governor of Edo State, Mr. Godwin Obaseki. According to the APC National Chairman, who reacted to the allegation of the Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, Hon. Frank Okiye, the Edo State governor was supporting illegating by inaugurating the Edo State Assembly at the hour he did and by recognising Okiye as Speaker. He dismissed the allegation of the Edo State Speaker on the plot of some lawmakers to impeach the governor,  stating that he is not the Speaker of Edo State and should not be recognised so. In a statement from his Chief Press Secretary,  Oshiomhole insisted that Hon.Frank Okiye is not the Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, asserting that he will not close his eyes to illegal decisions and actions capable of derailing the nation’s democracy. According to the statement, the APC Chairman noted that he has no personal quarrel with Governor Obaseki, as he stressed that what the governor was supposed to do was to lobby all the 24 members of the House, who are all APC members, so as to produce a Speaker of his choice but that inaugurating the House at 9:30pm with nine members was a rape on the nation’s democracy
