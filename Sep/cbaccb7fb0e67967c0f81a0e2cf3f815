*Urges supporters to remain calm Kunle Olayeni, Abeokuta The lawmaker representing Ijebu Central Federal Constituency, Hon. Kolapo Korede Osunsanya, on Tuesday, said he will appeal the judgement of the National and State Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal which nullified his election. Osunsanya, a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), urged his supporters to remain calm and be patient over the court verdict. The tribunal, led by Justice Wakkil Alkali Gana had, on Monday, nullified the lawmakerâ€™s election and ordered a rerun to be conducted within 90 days in two units and an entire ward in the federal constituency. The Ijebu Central Federal Constituency comprises three local government areas including Ijebu-Ode, Ijebu North East and Odogbolu. The tribunal had delivered judgement in a petition filed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Taiwo Shote, challenging the declaration of Osunsanya as winner of the February 23, 2019 election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). It specifically cancelled elections in Ward 5, Unit 5 in Ijebu Ode Local Government; Ward 10, Unit 3 in Odogbolu Local Government and the entire Ward 8 in Ijebu North East Local Government in the constituency. The tribunal held that since the margin of lead and difference between the petitioner and 1st respondent was less than 4,000 and the total number of cancelled votes was 8,800, the INEC ought not to have declared Osunsanya as winner of the election in line with the provisions of the Electoral Act. However, in a statement issued by his media office and made available to reporters in Abeokuta, Osunsanya implored his teeming supporters and party members not to entertain any fear over the judgement.
