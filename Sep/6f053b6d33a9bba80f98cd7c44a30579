…as state govt fails to remit N470m The National Examination Council (NECO) has withheld the results of over 30,000 public school students due to debts owed by the Niger State government, thereby leading to their failure to attend post-utme screenings of the universities of their choice.
This is as the state government has admitted that they are owing the examination body N470 million adding that they have managed to pay N150 million.
Findings have it that the students could not access their May/June SSCE results and are asking the government to intervene.
It should be recalled that the NECO May/June SSCE results were released on the August 27.
When our Correspondent spoke to some of the affected students, they bemoaned their inability to access their results so as to attend post-utme screenings of the universities of their choice.
However, the Permanent Secretary of the Niger State Ministry of Education, Abubakar Aliyu, who spoke to journalists, admitted that they are owning the examination body but appealed for consideration to enable the students to access their results especially those due for port utme screenings.
