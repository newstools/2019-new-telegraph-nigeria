 A 20-year-old man, Mustapha Aliyu, has been arrested by the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) for allegedly throwing his four-month-old son into river at Uti in Borgu Local Government Area of Niger State.   Aliyu confessed killing his baby. He said: “I killed my own son. I am the father of the child. Although I am not officially married to the girl (the baby’s mother), I intend to marry her before the unfortunate incident.”   The suspect, however, attributed his action to his mother’s rejection of the baby. He said: “My mother did not accept my son; that is why I threw him into the river.   “I know what I have done is evil, but it was devil that pushed me. I am guilty; I am ready to be sentenced to prison where I will seek forgiveness from Almighty Allah, my creator.” When asked if he acted and alone or connived with the mother of the child, Aliyu said, “no, she did not even know. It was after I threw the baby into the river that everyone knew. I know she is crying and in pains now. I pray she forgives me.”   While parading the suspect in Minna, the state NSCDC Commandant, George Edem, told journalists that the baby’s body was yet to be found but there was vigilance and monitoring. Edem said that following a tip off on Saturday, his men apprehended the suspect, an indigene of Kebbi State but residing at Tamaniya village near Kainji in Borgu Local Government Area. He added that the suspect admitted to have committed the offence and had been handed over to the police for prosecution. The NSCDC boss, however, advised parents to take good care of their children; monitor their wards and advise them accordingly.
