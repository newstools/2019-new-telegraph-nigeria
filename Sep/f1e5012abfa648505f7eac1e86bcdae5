 W ith the recent closure of Nigeria’s land borders by the Federal Government, which has reduced smuggling across Nigeria’s international borders by over 80 per cent, hitherto scarce local rice is now available in Lagos markets but is selling at over N20, 000 per 50 kg bag.   This is coming as foreign rice, which was the most smuggled food item from Nigeria’s next neighbours, Benin Republic, Niger Republic, Chad and Cameroon; is now difficult to be smuggled into the country sequel to the ‘Exercise ‘Swift Response’ which is now over one month old.   Sunday Telegraph Market Survey team which visited some of the markets in Lagos on Wednesday and Thursday, learnt that different brands of local rice; Ebonyi, Olam, Lake, Dangote and Coscharis rice are now in the market, the foreign rice which use to flood the markets in spite of the ban on importation of rice through the land borders is now scarce in most of the markets visited.   However, while the brands are different, one thing in common among them is the price, which was on the high side, though with slight differences. The prices range from N19, 500, N20, 000, N21, 000 and N22, 000 per 50 kg bag depending on the market and brand.   In view of this, some of the consumers spoken to in the markets said that local and available foreign rice has suddenly become a ‘big man’s’ food as an average Nigerian now struggles to get it as a result of the exorbitant price.   At Mushin Market, Mr. Victor Eze, who is a foodstuff dealer in the market, spoke the increase in the price of the produce, he said, that 50kg of local rice is sold at N19, 500, N20, 000 depending on the brand.   According to him, the increase in price started about a month ago and as they continue to run out of their old stock of foreign rice, the price of the local rice continues to increase. He disclosed that even Customs officers have continued to patrol the market in recent times to seize foreign rice, if they see any in the market. He said, other markets, he heard the Customs officers have visited severally in the last two weeks, includes Iddo and Onyigbo markets.
