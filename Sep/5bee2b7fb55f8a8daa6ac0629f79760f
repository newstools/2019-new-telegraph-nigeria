Kunle Olayeni, Abeokuta The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) has expressed concern over the continued insecurity in the country saying the Federal Government appears overwhelmed by the development. The episcopal body, which noted that various security challenges have made living in Nigeria very precarious, called for proper decentralization of security agencies for effective results. Rising from the CBCN second plenary meeting held in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, the bishops said in a communiqué issued that there can be no stability and enabling environment for meaningful development without adequate security of lives and property. The communiqué, titled “Moving beyond precarious living in Nigeria,” was jointly signed by the CBCN President, Most Rev. Augustine Akubeze, and the Secretary, Most Rev. Camillus Umoh. It observed that the nation’s democracy was fast derailing, noting that the qualities of accountability, transparency, independence of the judiciary, respect for fundamental rights, observance of the rule of law, and fair and credible electoral process were still lacking. It appealed to the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration not to allow ethnic or religious hegemony to prevail in the country, adding that there should be fairness in appointments to positions of national importance, sharing of resources, and distribution of social amenities. While acknowledging efforts being made to fight insecurity in the land, the Catholic bishops declared that a lot more still needs to be done. The CBCN urged governments at all levels to provide the enabling environment for the creation of job opportunities for teeming youth population, noting that this would minimise the menace of insecurity in the country. The second plenary meeting was held between September 11 and 20 at the Divine Mercy Pastoral Centre, Agbamaya, Obada-Oko, Abeokuta.
