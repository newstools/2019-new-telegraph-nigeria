Deputy Chairman Senate Committee on Defence and Senator representing Plateau North Senatorial District, Senator Istifanus Gyang has condemned the murder of two persons and rustling of 120cows and 100 sheep by suspected herdsmen in Foron District of Barkin Ladi LGA, Plateau State on Wednesday. The Senator, in a press statement signed by his Senior Adviser on Media and Protocol, Hon. Musa Ashoms and issued to journalists on Thursday in Jos, said criminals and bandits who trade in crime and bloodshed must face the wrath of the law so that the lives and property of law abiding citizens can be secured. The Senator recalled that not long ago, President Muhammadu Buhari ordered the military and police to ensure that all blood-thirsty bandits across the nation are done away with. He urged the STF and the Police to quickly enforce the Presidential order to arrest violent attacks on peace loving citizens and communities in Plateau North. According to the statement, Senator Gyang said he remains focused and committed to the mandate given to him to secure and reconcile the people and also empower the people of Plateau North. He, however, urged the people of Plateau State to be very vigilant against criminals and bandits whose actions constitute a threat to peace.
