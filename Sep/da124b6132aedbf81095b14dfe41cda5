A fresh robbery attack at the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, (IBBU) Lapai in Niger State has left two students seriously injured. However, seven arrests have also been made. The recent attack, which happened in the wee hours of Monday, left one of the victims, a 100 Level student of Computer Science with a deep cut in his head and one of the suspects (student too) stabbed on the stomach. The victim, identified as Abdulhadi Danyay, who is still battling to survive at the IBB Specialist Hospital, Minna was said to have been attacked by the suspects two weeks ago. Investigations have it that, Abdulhadi was able to identify one of the robbers (also a student) who attacked him and planned to report to school and security authorities before they revisited him. Three students of the same university were arrested for an alleged robbery incident which occurred two weeks ago when they raided a 25-room off campus hostel of the university dispossessing the occupants of their phones, laptops, Ipads, clothing, jewelleries and other valuables. A reliable source, who pleaded anonymity, said the name of the student’s hostel accommodation attacked is ‘Jagaba Lodge’ at Student’s Villa. While speaking to our Correspondent on phone, the source said: “The robbers came around 1am on Monday and out of the 10 rooms in the lodge, they burgled eight; collecting phones, laptops and monies in the process.”
