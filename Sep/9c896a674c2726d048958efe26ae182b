Controversial Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh, has admonished her fellow ladies not to sleep with “a large number” of men just to get the new iPhone 11. The talented movie star took to her Instagram page to announce the acquisition of the phone which goes for N600,000. She said she bought the phone with her own money and that there is nothing special about the device. “There is nothing special about the phone. Don’t hustle. Don’t sleep with 100 men to get this phone. I just bought it with my own money. There is nothing special. Girls don’t fool yourself. It’s just a phone,” she said. “E no pass call and text ooo.. No wound yaself mu sisters… Take it easy on your p***y!!!.” In another post, the River State-born Nollywood star confirmed that she actually purchased three pieces of the phone — one for herself, one for her dad and one for another person who she did not mention. “Promised Daddy he gonno be the first man in his village to use iPhone 11…. One for me, One for Dad, GUESS who the Last one is for?? #Here he goes #Dluvofmylife #Daddysgirl,” she wrote. Okuneye Idris Olarenwaju, controversial internet personality and cross-dresser also known as Bobrisky, however, took to his Instagram page hours later to express his gratitude to Tonto for getting him the iPhone 11. “@tontolet I love you. She just bought me latest iPhone 11. I bless the day we became friends. Wat ? I’m still shocked. Guys go and thank @tontolet for me. iPhone 11. Is good to have rich friends,” he wrote. Tonto had recently revealed how witches pressed her chest while she was asleep on Sunday night.
