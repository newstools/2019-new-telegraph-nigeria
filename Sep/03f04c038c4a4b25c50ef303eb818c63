Nigerian billionaire Femi Otedola has offered to foot the medical bills of ailing Reggae music icon, Majek Fashek. The ‘Send Down The Rain’ crooner has been seriously ill. According to Fashek manager, Uzoma Omenka, the benevolent businessman has decided to foot all the medical bills for the ailing singer who has been admitted in a London based hospital. “We really appreciate him for coming through and taking care of the hospital bills. It’s a huge relief and we are grateful. We however still need more support from well-meaning Nigerians to take care of other expenses,” Omenka said. This latest development is coming days after Majek’s manager had debunked the claims he was dead. According to him, Majek was still in the hospital and only required prayers and funds from well-meaning Nigerians. He added that the reports on social media about Majek Fashek’s death are mere rumours. He also said the singer is responding to treatment and would require more donations and prayers from well-meaning fans and individuals. “9:30 PM from London in Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Today is Sunday, this is to inform all the well-wishers, fans and lovers of Majek Fashek back in Nigeria that Majek is not dead, he is very fine. I just stepped out now because of this ongoing music that people are saying that he is dead. Let’s not wish him dead, let’s join hands and pray for him. “For those of you that are praying, prayers are working, every day there is a gradual improvement. We need funds, we need money for maintenance. The notable Nigerians that deposited for his medication…but we still need money for other things. We also heard that people are raising money which is without our consent…” he said. Omenka’s statement was coming after news of the reggae icon’s reported death started making headlines. It would be recalled that a few days ago, the manager announced that Majek Fashek was gravely ill and hospitalised.
