The Minister of Youths and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, has described the upcoming friendly game between Nigeria and Brazil as a good test for the Super Eagles. Speaking in Abuja on Saturday, Dare said the game would expose the Super Eagles’ strengths and weaknesses.  It would be recalled that the Nigeria Football Federation recently announced the top of the bill match which will come up at the Singapore National Stadium in Kallang on October 13. Dare said that even though the game was a friendly, there was a lot at stake for both countries, describing it as a good test for the Super Eagles.  “The game in Singapore is a friendly, but also it is a friendly that we think will test our boys and we will see how prepared they are,” he said.  “It will also show our strong departments and areas where we are weak, so, we look forward to a very engaging and interesting game. “We all know that Brazil is reputed to be a footballing nation and Nigeria is also one.  We have ego at play even though it’s a friendly, but we have two great footballing nations playing a friendly and we hope Nigeria will excel. “I am not one that predicts matches, but I hope our boys will play excellently well because we have got talents on that team and I know they will show what they have got on the day.”  Dare also said the Buhari administration was committed to ensuring an all-round development of sports, adding that the Sports Ministry was ready to work with all the federations in the country.
