Chris Okagbue won the Gulder Ultimate Search Season 8 and since then his career has soared to greater heights. He’s also a fashion enthusiast and style influencer.  He is multi-talented and successfully juggles different areas in the entertainment industry. The Anambra State-born model, actor and producer shares with VANESSA OKWARA his fashion choices, what attracts him to a lady and rise to stardom   What’s happening to you currently, career wise?   I’ve been working a lot, less of modeling and more of acting. I’ve done quite a number of films. Some have been released; some are yet to be released. I also have a couple more to film in coming weeks. It’s been a very busy year for me and I’m grateful to God for workflow.   You have become a big style influencer, how did you evolve into this and what informs your style choices?   I’ve always been someone who loves fashion and style. I actually don’t know or can’t say how I became a big style influencer. I just do my own thing and try not to look like someone else in terms of style. I’ve been honoured by a number of award bodies and getting nominations and some wins as a style influencer. Regarding what informs my style, I pretty much just like to continuously reinvent myself and not because of what’s trending out there. As long as I feel good, stylish and comfortable in what I wear, I’m good to go. I’ve also found that I’m becoming more adventurous with colours and designs, but I’m still somewhat conservative and may not necessarily go overboard.  <img class="size-medium wp-image-243878 alignleft" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Chris-Okagbue2.png?resize=300%2C147&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="147" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Chris-Okagbue2.png?resize=300%2C147&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Chris-Okagbue2.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1"> Mention some of the movies you’ve been in recently?   Like I said, it’s been a busy year for me. By God’s grace I’ve done a few movies in the last one year. Some of them include Bolanle Austen-Peters’ directorial debut film, ‘The Bling Lagosians’, ‘Intruder’, ‘A Woman’s Wrath’, ‘Mma’, ‘Girls Night Out’, ‘Thorn of Fire’, ‘Love and Lust’, ‘The Prenup’, ‘The Moles’, ‘Women In Our Lives’, ‘Inhibition’, ‘The Creek’, ‘Slip’, ‘The Grim’, ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ and ‘My Grandfather’s Wife’. I’m hoping to do a lot more before the year runs out.   Which would you say brought you to limelight?   I would say Gulder Ultimate search and Tinsel.   Winning Gulder Ultimate Search (GUS) was a big landmark for you. What would you say it did for you as a person?   It was interesting living with people I didn’t know anything about. Also, learning to survive eviction on a daily basis had taught me to expect challenges in my life and be prepared to take them on.   Also, it has given me a platform to excel in my chosen career. It helped to further my acting career which I have been doing even before the Gulder ultimate search.  Having been exposed to a whole lot of people, I get more roles. I also produce as well. I have produced my own movie, ‘Lotanna’.  There’s been a clamour to bring back GUS. What’s your take on this?  <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-243878" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Chris-Okagbue2.png?resize=300%2C147&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="147" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Chris-Okagbue2.png?resize=300%2C147&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Chris-Okagbue2.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1"> I’ve come to learn over the past couple of years since the show was suspended that a lot of people actually loved the show much more than I thought. It had a different kind of entertainment appeal. Anyone could watch it irrespective of age. More importantly, it encouraged the youth to desire to be much more than they were and empowered them to do so. It’s been the desire of not just fans of the show but also the inner circle, and by inner circle I mean people who have been part of the show like the past contestants and past winners for the show to make a comeback. I’m sure Nigerian Breweries as a company are aware of this. But I also know from a business perspective that it takes a lot to run a show of that magnitude. So, if/when we feel that a reboot would be beneficial to the brand, I’m sure that they would do so.   There’s also been a comparison between GUS and BBNaija, with a lot of people asking that GUS replaces BBNaija, how do you feel about that?   I see absolutely no reason why one has to suffer for the other. They may have their similarities but they are two different kinds of reality TV show. There’s really no need to replace one with the other. Big Brother Africa coexisted with GUS back in the day. Who says Big Brother Naija cannot do same?   What are the qualities you look out for in a woman you want to marry?   I’m a family-oriented person. I’d like for my woman to be the same. Pretty face first before any other body features. I mean, if I’m going to be waking up to that face every day for the rest of my life, it had better be pretty.   I look out for qualities such as confidence, independence, strong will, intelligence, wit and a great sense of humour cause I joke around a lot so she has to be able to let her hair down and have a good laugh every now and then.   Unfortunately, I can’t cook. So, it’ll be nice to be with someone who not only can but also likes to. She must also have a good relationship with God.   I come from a somewhat traditional home. But for some reason I am not tribalistic. So I can marry from any tribe really.   What is your educational background?   I hold a BSc in sociology from University of Lagos. I got into the entertainment industry at a very tender age. I started as far back as 2004 when I was 17 years old with lots of modelling jobs. I was doing it partly as well as a whole lot of things. So when I got into the university, I just faced my studies and ensured that finished my schooling. Entertainment can be very distracting and can make you want to quit school.   What was growing up like?   Growing up was fantastic. I had a very supportive family. I was born into the royal family of former Obi of Onitsha, H.R.H Obi Ofala Okechukwu Okagbue and Ogechukwu Clara Okagbue of Onitsha Kingdom, Anambra State. I have five siblings. My dad has passed away but my mum has been there for me as well as my siblings. My elder sister Sandra was the one that paved the way for me in the industry. She is into modeling. She paved the way and I followed suit and it has been great so far. I come from a family of artistic people.  Where do you see yourself in five years’ time?   Simple; being happy and fulfilled with whatever it is that I am doing at that point in time.   If given the opportunity, would you go into politics in future?  What’s your view of the current government?   At the moment, I don’t think so. Regarding my view on the current government, all I can say is that there is still a lot of room for improvement.
