Boko Haram terrorists have attempted to assassinate Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, sources say. On Thursday, the insurgents reportedly fired shots at Zulum’s convoy in an attempt to kill him. The attack took place about 9 pm local time. According to online news portal, TheCable, security sources said the insurgents attacked the convoy in Konduga while Zulum was returning from a trip to Bama Local Council. The Borno governor had visited Bayo, Kwaya Kusar, Askira Uba and Gwoza as part of his “familiarity and need assessment tour” of the 27 LGAs in the state. The source explained: “Luckily the governor, his commissioners, and other vehicles in the convoy escaped unhurt but the last vehicle which is an army gun truck was pelted with bullets. “Immediately after they fired at us, our men in collaboration with the armed personnel from the Federal Special Anti Robbery Squad, retaliated and thwarted the ambush.” The attack came seven months after Kashim Shettima, Zulum’s predecessor, was attacked by Boko Haram insurgents on his way to Gamboru Ngala in Borno.
