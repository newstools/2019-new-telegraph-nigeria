     The Director-General of National Orientation Agency (NOA), Dr Garba Abari, on Thursday, cautioned elected representatives in government against isolating themselves from their constituents. Abari, who spoke at a workshop in Abeokuta, Ogun State, said lack of understanding of the citizens’ needs and yearnings had been the bane of the country’s problems. The workshop tagged, “Forum on Citizens’ Conversation with elected public officials,” was organised by NOA in collaboration with the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung (KAS), a German political foundation. At the event, the House of Assembly Speaker, Olakunle Oluomo, and the KAS Country Representative, Dr Vladimir Kreck, stressed the need for Nigerians to actively participate in politics and governance processes towards improving the lot of the country. Abari, who was represented by a National Director, Mrs Ngozi Ekeoba, said in his address that political office holders must foster inclusiveness in governance in order to adequately meet the people’s needs. He noted that the legislators, as representatives of the people, have great role to play in engendering trust in government and improving relationship between the government and the governed.
