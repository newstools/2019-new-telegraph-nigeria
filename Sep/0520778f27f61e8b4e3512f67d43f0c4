Driver, an international online ride-hailing service with headquarters in New York, United States and used by over 26 million people across some 200 cities, is now available for residents of Lagos. inDriver users can independently set the price for their trip, while drivers can choose the most profitable and convenient orders. The app’s Real Time Deals model combats algorithms used by other ride-hailing companies, which rack up prices because of peak hours, traffic and request history. inDriver allows passengers to set their own fare for their chosen route. Nearby drivers who receive notice of ride requests have three choices – accept the fare offered, ignore the offer or bargain for a higher price. The company said it wanted customers and drivers to independently and directly determine the fare and favourable price of each trip. Commenting on the activities of the company, the Chief Marketing Officer, inDriver, Egor Fedorov, said: “Already, residents of Lagos, using inDriver, would be able to make sure that the cost of travel can be significantly lower than the usual prices.” He noted that Lagos was the first city in Nigeria where inDriver was launched while the service was already operating in Uganda, Kenya, South Africa and Tanzania. Fedorov said inDriver had already connected over 6,000 drivers in Lagos with new drivers being registered daily. “Until today, taxi services in Nigeria did not leave any choice for local residents when it came to the cost of the trip. Users were only offered to agree to the price specified in the application or on the taxi counter.
