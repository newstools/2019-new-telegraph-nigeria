Contrary to Federal Government’s preference to deal with labour issues on an ad-hoc basis, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has advised that it should adopt the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention, which recommends a tripartite body to address issues concerning workers. President pf NLC, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, while giving the advice in Abuja, also said there was need for a review of obsolete labour laws in the country to bring them up to date with international best practices. He spoke at the inauguration of the International Lawyers Assisting Workers Network, stressing that reviewing such laws would make them more effective to defend the rights of workers across the country. He said the absence of the Nigeria labour advisory council had relegated issues on workers’ rights to an ad hoc arrangement against the ILO conventions that employers, government and labour should sit at a round-table to address issues on workers. The labour leaders noted that among the strongest pillars of democracy were the civil society groups and organised labour, adding that “once you weaken those two institutions, it then means that democracy itself will be weakened and the rule of law will also be weakened.” The NLC president said the inauguration of the body would provide labour another opportunity to synergise as there have been a lot of changes in the world of work.
