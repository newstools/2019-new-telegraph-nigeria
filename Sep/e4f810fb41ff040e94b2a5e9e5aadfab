The Tribunal Chairman, Justice Mohammed Garba has called for a short break in order to allow everyone “freshen up”.  ** Tribunal refuses APC’s application challenging the competence of Atiku’s petition. ** Tribunal strikes out Atiku’s star witness, Osita Chidoka’s statement for raising fresh issues and for being filed seven days after the stipulated time. ** The tribunal struck out an application filed by INEC, the first respondent, asking it to nullify grounds 4 and 5 of the petition filed by Atiku and the PDP. The ground 4 is seeking the court to disqualify Buhari on grounds of non-qualification while ground 5 is claiming Buhari submitted false information of a fundamental nature. But the tribunal held that grounds 4 and 5 of the petition is not a pre-election matter and that they are hereby accepted based on the provisions of the electoral act 2010 as amended.  ** The tribunal has just dismissed another application by INEC praying the tribunal to strike out the list of witnesses and ground that the name of the lawyer Livy Uzoukwu (SAN) is not a lawyer known to practice in Nigeria and enrolled in Supreme Court Earlier, the tribunal also dismissed INEC’s application seeking an order of the tribunal to strike out Atiku and PDP’s petition on ground that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo is not joined as a necessary party. The tribunal held that going by the 1999 Constitution and the Electoral Act, a Vice President is not a necessary party but an interested one. The tribunal held that the Vice President need not be joined in the petition since the candidate of the party and the party itself are joined in the petition.
