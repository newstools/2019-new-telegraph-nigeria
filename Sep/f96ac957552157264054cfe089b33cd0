Pauline Onyibe, Yenagoa David Lyon, the flag bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State for the November 16 governorship election at the weekend said he was validly elected and was waiting for his Certificate of Return from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Lyon made this known in Yenagoa on Saturday night during the commissioning of the David Lyon/Senator Degi Governorship campaign office by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva. Lyon, who also dismissed the claims by supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that he cannot speak by delivering his speech in English, said the authenticity of a flag bearer goes beyond the brandishing of Party’s Certificate of Return as done by the PDP candidate, Senator Douye Diri. He said: “If you want to be known as a genuine flag bearer, it is not flashing a Certificate of Return from your political party. And we don’t see it anymore. I will not flash the Certificate of Return from my party as flag bearer. On our own, we are waiting to take the INEC’s Certificate of Return.” Lyon, who spoke inside the Campaign Secretariat instead of addressing the mammoth crowd that had been waiting for him for hours, said he will never disappoint them if elected into office as governor. Earlier in his speech, the state leader of the APC and Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva expressed optimism that the APC and her flag bearer in the state would usher in the much needed progress. Sylva was confident that the pair of Chief David Lyon and Senator Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo, as Governor and Deputy Governor, respectively will be able to take the state to the next level.
