No fewer than 500 patients will benefit from a week-long free multimillion naira medical and surgical interventions funded by the Kwara State Government that would kick off on Monday at the Ilorin General Hospital in the state capital.  First in the history of the state, the interventions, which involve procedures such as cataract, glaucoma, hernia, and neurosurgery, among others, are in partnership with the trio of Kwara State Association of Nigeria USA, Sakinah Medical Outreach, and the Kwara State chapter of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA).  Slated to hold between September 23 and 27, the surgical interventions are a follow up to the statewide medical mission during which doctors attended to over 2500 patients suffering from various ailments and offered medical advice and the ongoing medical screenings across most of the general hospitals in the state.  “These interventions are a part of Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq’s agenda to ensure good healthcare for the people. The governor had graciously released the sum of N26.9 million for the interventions, covering the medical missions conducted across the state a few weeks ago and the cost of purchasing the equipment to prepare the hospital for these procedures in line with global best practices,” Prof. Wale Sulaiman, Special Adviser to the Governor on Health Matters, said in a statement on Sunday.  “The exercise is in partnership with the KSANG, Sekinah and the Kwara State chapter of the NMA which brought US and Nigeria-based medical experts for the mission,” he said.
