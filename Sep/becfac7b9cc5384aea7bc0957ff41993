Residents of about 20 communities in Sagamu Local Government Area of Ogun State, on Tuesday, called on Governor Dapo Abiodun to enforce the provisions of the Anti-land Grabbing Law in the state.  The residents, who stormed the Governor’s Office, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta protesting the activities of suspected land grabbers in their areas, said effective implementation of the law will permanently address the problem.  The affected communities in Sagamu include Makun, Ewuoje, Ewulisa, Panuyi, Amitiku, Igbodorigi, Erelu, Dugbe, Ewulosi and Ijamade, among others.  Armed with placards bearing different inscriptions, the protesters decried the invasion of their areas by land grabbers who allegedly had continued to destroy property worth millions of naira.  Led by Captain Michael Ade Shonubi (rtd), the protesters accused one Kamorudeen Lamina aka “Sir Kay Oluwo” of allegedly sponsoring vicious attacks by hoodlums on their communities, resulting in death and destruction.  Shonubi explained that several efforts to report the matter to police and other security agencies had failed to yield the desired results.
