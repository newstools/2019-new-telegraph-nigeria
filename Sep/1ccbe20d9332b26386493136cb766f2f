Youths under the aegis of Coalition of Niger State Civil Society Groups have given a two-week ultimatum to the Federal Government to mobilise contractors to fix all dilapidated federal roads in the state or face a showdown.
This is coming a week after former Spokesman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, Comrade Jonathan Vatsa lambasted President Muhammadu Buhari for ‘shortchanging’ Niger State after massively voting for him.
While addressing journalists on Monday at the IBB Pen House, Minna, Spokesman, Mohammed Etsu called on the Federal Government for immediate intervention saying, “if nothing is done between now and the next two weeks, we will mobilise 500,000 youths to clampdown activities and match to Abuja.”
Etsu while responding to questions, said: “Niger State voted massively for the All Progressives Congress (APC) and all the candidates that contested on the platform at state and national level but now abandoned with all federal roads linking the state becoming death traps and nobody is doing anything about it.
“We will protest and march to Abuja to express our displeasure over the deplorable state of federal roads across the state.
“We are calling on the Federal Government to fix all federal roads or we will block all roads. The bad roads are signs that Niger State is continually being shortchanged by the Federal government.”
