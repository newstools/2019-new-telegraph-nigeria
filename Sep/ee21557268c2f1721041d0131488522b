The Anambra State government has in the last three years lost over N4billion intervention funds made available by the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) following the non-recognition of its state polytechnic by the Federal Government.   It would be recalled that the Anambra State polytechnic was a College of Agriculture before it was upgraded to the status of a polytechnic three years ago.  Against this backdrop, the sum of N208Billion TETFunds disbursed to tertiary institutions in the country for the year 2019 did not include the Anambra State Polytechnic since they are not recognized by NBTE.   A breakdown of the sum indicates that roughly N550million is made available to polytechnics annually as TETFunds and in the last three years the state institution began formal existence on paper it has lost over N4billion as un-accessed annual intervention and special high impact intervention.  According to the Board, guidelines for accreditation the Anambra Polytechnic may not need up to N200 million to prepare for the NBTE accreditation and national recognition which it has failed to do.   However, when contacted the Anambra State Commissioner for Tertiary Education, Prof Theresa Obiekezie refused to see this reporter and wrote on her visitors’ form that she is “Not Disposed”.   Consequent upon the non-recognition of the state polytechnic by the board, graduates of the state polytechnic will not be qualified for admission into any polytechnic in Nigeria for their High National Diploma HND.
