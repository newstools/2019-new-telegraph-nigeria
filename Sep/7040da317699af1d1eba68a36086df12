Riyad Mahrez’s brilliant free-kick and a late goal from Raheem Sterling helped give Manchester City victory over Everton at Goodison Park.  The Premier League champions were ahead through Gabriel Jesus’ close-range header, but Everton equalised before half-time when Dominic Calvert-Lewin dived in to nod the ball over the goal line.   Mahrez restored City’s lead with a superb effort that just curled past Everton keeper Jordan Pickford, and Ederson kept his side ahead with excellent saves to deny Calvert-Lewin and Yerry Mina.  Sterling sealed City’s win with a first-time shot that rebounded off the underside of the crossbar to just cross the line for a result that keeps City in second place and still five points behind leaders Liverpool.   And Maurcio Pochettino says he will shoulder the “blame” for Hugo Lloris’ howler in 10-man Tottenham’s 2-1 Premier League win over Southampton.   France goalkeeper – and 2018 World Cup winner – was inexplicably dispossessed inside his own six-yard area by Danny Ings for Saints’ equaliser following a back pass.   In the first game of the day, Jurgen Klopp said Liverpool “deserved” victory at Sheffield United despite needing a “lucky” Georginio Wijnaldum goal to continue their perfect start to the Premier League season at a raucous Bramall Lane.   The winner was a moment to forget for the otherwise faultless Blades goalkeeper Dean Henderson, who spilled the Dutchman’s tame effort before it squirmed agonisingly over the line.
