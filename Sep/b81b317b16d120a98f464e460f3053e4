P ay television operator, MultiChoice, has announced the return of its “Step Up” campaign for its DStv and GOtv customers.   The company, in a statement released at the weekend, said the offer, which runs from Monday, 2 September to Thursday, 31 October, is designed to give all active and disconnected DStv Compact, Family and Access customers the opportunity to pay for a package a step above their current package and get a boost to view programming on an even higher package.   Also, active and disconnected GOtv customers, especially those on GOtv Plus, Value and Lite packages, will be able to upgrade to GOtv Max and have access to quality programming on the package.   Chief Customer Officer, MultiChoice Nigeria, Martin Mabutho, said the campaign, which ran initially from 15 January until 15 April 2019, is back just in time for customers on lower DStv and GOtv packages to enjoy all the exciting content lined up on higher packages at reduced costs.   “When we launched this first-of-its-kind offer back in January, the objective was to give our customers the opportunity to experience great entertainment on DStv and GOtvpackages they normally would not have been on. The campaign was well received by our customers, and we are pleased to announce a second installment of the offer,” Mabutho said.   Explaining the details of the offer, Mabutho said DStv customers currently on the Access package who pay N4,000 for Family package will get boosted to view programmes on the Compact package, while customers currently on the Family package who pay N6,800 for Compact package will be given Compact Plus package. Likewise, Compact customers who pay N10,650 for Compact Plus package will, in turn, get Premium package programming.
