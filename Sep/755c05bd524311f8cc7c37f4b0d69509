A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State, Perekeme Kpodoh has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene in the crisis rocking the party in  the state following the emergence of David Lyon as the flag bearer of the party for the November 16 governorship election. He, however, said a meeting of all the aspirants should be convened where he said all those who contested in the primary, the flag bearer, Lyon, Chief Timipre Sylva, who is the Minister of State (Petroleum) and the National Leadership of the party will meet to discuss and resolve the crisis if the APC was still interested in winning the state. In a statement released in Yenagoa at the weekend and made available to New Telegraph, Kpodoh described as ‘a mockery’ the figure allegedly given as votes cast for Chief Lyon. According to Kpodoh, the less than 49,000 votes recorded during the controversial primaries is questionable considering that about 200,000 voted for Buhari during the last Presidential primary of the party.
