The National Assembly Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Makurdi, on Wednesday dismissed the petition filed by former Senator representing Benue North West George Akume against Senator Emmanuel Orker Jev.
Delivering judgement in the petition, Chairman of the Tribunal Justice R.O. Odugu held that the petitioners failed to prove in ground two of their petition that the election was marred by irregularities and non compliance with the Electoral Act 2010 as amended.
Justice Odugu stated that the law is clear that where there are allegations against persons not joined, this would be a breach of their fundamental human right.
He added that it is unnecessary to join such persons once a political party had already been joined.
One ground one of the petition which hinged on whether Senator Jev was duly elected by lawful votes cast during the election, the tribunal chairman accused Akume of failure to lead evidence polling unit by polling unit, ward by ward to show that non compliance affectedÂ  result of the election.
Justice Odugu also faulted the use of smart card reader which according to him is not acceptable in law, positing that manual voter register will continue to play a vital role in determining election processes.
