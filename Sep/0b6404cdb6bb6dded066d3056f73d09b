For the second time in six months, the indigent in Lagos have had cause to smile courtesy of the Glorious Vessels Foundation. The Foundation founded in 2012 by Ruckey Peniel, an international public speaker, author, and host of Hope Now TV and Conferences, reaches out to the poor and vulnerable in Nigeria and around the world. Recently, the Foundation through its HOTS (Hope on the Streets), Lagos programme lit up the faces of children and indigent adults on the streets of Agege. It is the second of such programme they would be holding in Lagos this year, the last one being an outreach programme in Iyana- Ipaja in March. The Agege Outreach programme on Saturday involved the distribution of food items, water and other items to the recipients who turned out enthusiastically to welcome the HOTS team. Jasmine Asekome, one of the coordinators of last Saturday’s outreach quoting Peniel said the foundation, which is an offspring of Vessels of Hope, a non-profit organisation and the charity arm of Hope Now TV and Conferences, is concerned about the growing number of children and destitute on Nigerian streets. “We have a burden for the homeless and downtrodden, who on our streets, face hunger and deprivation. This is why we have returned to Lagos six months after our last programme in Iyana-Ipaja, to reach out to the people of Agege.”
