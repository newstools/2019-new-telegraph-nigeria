Kunle Olayeni, Abeokuta A former deputy governor of Ogun State, Senator Adegbenga Kaka, on Sunday, asked the Allied People’s Movement (APM) not to appeal the judgement of the Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal affirming Governor Dapo Abiodun’s election. He declared that “any further unpatriotic pursuit” was capable of holding the state down on growth and development. Kaka, who formerly represented Ogun East Senatorial District in the National Assembly, gave the admonition in a statement issued and made available to reporters in Abeokuta. In a six-hour judgement delivered on Saturday, the tribunal dismissed the petition of the APM governorship candidate, Adekunle Akinlade, challenging Abiodun’s victory in the March 9 gubernatorial election. The three-man tribunal, led by Justice Yusuf Halilu, held that the petitioners failed to prove their allegations of over-voting and falsification of information against the governor and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Reacting to the court verdict, Kaka stated that the tribunal members did a thorough job of systematic demolition of the APM’s petition which, he described, as “lazy, frivolous, malicious, pedestrian and spurious.” He noted that the petition had been a waste of precious judicial time, held down the state unnecessarily for four months and heated up the polity by causing distractions. He urged the petitioners to team up with the Abiodun-led administration and not venture to approach the Appeal Court.
