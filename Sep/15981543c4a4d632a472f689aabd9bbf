Scientists from Denmark said heavy cannabis users were more likely to have poor quality sperm due to the way tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in cannabis interacts with the endocannabinoid system in the body. These are the findings of a new study published in the journal ‘Scientific Reports’. THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is the chemical responsible for most of marijuana’s psychological effects. It acts much like the cannabinoid chemicals made naturally by the body, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). An estimated one in seven United States (US) adults uses marijuana. With more and more states legalising medicinal and recreational marijuana, it’s important to understand the effects of cannabis on sperm and if these changes hinder healthy fetal development. Whether or not marijuana use causes fertility problems and negatively affects sperm remains inconclusive as studies on the topic were mixed. Research has shown that moderate cannabis use can increase sperm counts, but another study found that THC in cannabis can lead to pronounced genetic changes in sperm. In the new study, the researchers analysed testicle tissue from 15 men and pieces of the cannabis system were found within the tissue samples. The researchers said that heavy THC use may overwhelm cannabis receptors and disrupt signaling crucial to healthy sperm development. In contrast, moderate cannabis users may see some benefits, but heavy use could counter these benefits and lead to lower quality sperm in men. According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), sperm defects include too few sperm, sperm that don’t move well (motility) or low-quality sperm. There are a lot of factors that involve a man’s overall health that turn out to impair sperm production. The study provides new evidence supporting observations that recreational cannabis can have possible deleterious effects on human testicular function,” the researchers stated in the study.
