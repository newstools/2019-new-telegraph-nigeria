Big Brother Naija housemate, Seyi Awolowo, has promised to have controversial co-contestant, Tacha, disqualified from the ongoing reality TV show. Seyi, a grandson of late sage, Obafemi Awolowo, said this during a feud between the friends on Thursday. The exchange began after Tacha got angry at Seyi for shouting her name. Tacha expressed displeasure at this and warning him not to try it again. She added that no housemate in the house is permitted to shout her name. In response, Seyi said: “I’m really disappointed with someone who does not know how to say the truth at first hand. I’m very disappointed in you Tacha; last las na strike you go get because of this issue. I will make sure you get that third strike.” In August, Tacha, who already had one strike for hitting fellow housemate, Joe, was given a second strike for being rude and undermining Big Brother’s authorities on several occasions. Biggie further warned that one more strike would automatically lead to her disqualification from the house.
