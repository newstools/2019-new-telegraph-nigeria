Observers of the Nigerian music terrain have been thrown into mourning since Thursday when the death of Mad Melon, one-half of popular music duo, Danfo Driver, was announced.  The death of the singer, one of those known to have come out of Ajegunle, was announced by veteran Galala singer, Daddy Showkey. Born Omeofa Oghene, the late musician was popularly known as Mad Melon and reportedly passed away on Wednesday, September 25, 2019. Taking to Instagram, 49-yearold Daddy Showkey made the announcement late morning on Thursday, writing: “Can somebody tell me that is not true that we just lost Mad Melon DANFO Driver pls.”  Known for their signature Galala-infused music, the duo achieved fame for their hit single titled “Danfo Driver” in the early 2000s during the era of a Galala dance form known as Suo which is captured in the song. The duo made a stop at an event in Lagos last year, accusing former MMMG act, Tekno, of sampling another of their hit song, “Kpolongo” in his new single titled ‘Jogodo” without permission. Since the news of the death hit public waves, Nigerians across various social media platforms, have been paying tribute to him.
