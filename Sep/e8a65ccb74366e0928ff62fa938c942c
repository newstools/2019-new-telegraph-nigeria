Nigeria will soon become the destination of choice in railway tourism with the International Railway Heritage partnering with Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) to see if they can replicate the railway museums in United Kingdom and Sierra Leone in Nigeria. The Managing Director, International Railway Heritage, Mr. Steve Davies, made this statement in Abuja during a courtesy call on the Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Amaechi. According to a statement by Mr. Eric Ojiekwe, Head, Press & PR, Ministry of Transport, Davies hinted that they would bring British heritage expertise to bear on what already exists in the country. He pointed out that there was an untapped potential in Nigeria to really improve the way the people of the country would tell the railway story. Furthermore, he explained that: “The appropriate time to start the legacy project is now, before the heritage is all swept away by the wave of modernisation going on in the rail sector.” He further suggested that if a facility could be created to collect and interpret that heritage to the public, it would have social and economic benefits that would also help the people to focus on the benefits of the railway for the future. On the steam engine, Davis disclosed that in the UK, railway heritage was a big business and money was made when the steam engine roared to life as many were enthralled by the sound of it. The MD observed that in the course of their findings, there were four redundant British built 1950s steam locomotives, out of which one or two could be restored for use in Nigeria as tourist trains, heritage trains and for educational excursions.
