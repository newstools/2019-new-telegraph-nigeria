Separate attacks hit a U.S. military base in the Somali town of Baledogle and a European military convoy in the Somali capital on Monday, a Reuters witness and a security source said. A Reuters journalist saw a seriously damaged armoured vehicle bearing a small Italian flag sticker in the capital of Mogadishu. It was unclear if there were any casualties. Also on Monday morning, there was a bomb attack followed by small arms fire at a base operated by U.S. Special Forces, a security source told Reuters.
