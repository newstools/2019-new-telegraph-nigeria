The Returning Officer for the Bayrlsa All Progressives Congress Primaries, Mai-Mala Buni the Governor of Yobe State on Tuesday night declared that the process to elect the governorship candidate of the party in the state will be the direct primary method following the vacation of the court order that earlier disrupted it.  Buni, who spoke after a meeting with the aspirants and major party stakeholders including the Minister of State for Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva and the former Minister of State for Agriculture, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, in Yenagoa said the process would be concluded within the time frame stipulated by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).  Buni said: “The process has commenced and we had a very wonderful meeting with the stakeholders. We adjourned the meeting to allow the process to continue. We have agreed to adhere to all the guidelines issued by the party.  “We have a timeframe within which we are working. The process is direct primaries and all the aspirants agreed with it. We are on the same page.  “We are here to provide the level-playing ground for all the aspirants. We are not hoping for violence. We are all APC and one big family so we have to work together to win the election.  “It is only one person that wins and when one person emerges we look forward for all the others to come forward and support him.”  The Sagbama High Court sitting in Yenagoa had set aside an interim order stopping the party from conducting its governorship primaries in the state using direct method.  The court presided by E.G. Umukoro, said the interim order, which he initially granted, could no longer stand following the argument contained in application on notice filed by the applicant respondent.
