A stray bullet fired by a mobile policeman has snuffed out the life of a father of four, Daudu Waliu, while packing chairs at Ladipo area of Lagos State. The policeman was said to have shot into the air to scare away some hoodlums when the bullet hit Waliu in the head. It was learnt that the victim, who was a stalwart of the All Progressives Congress (APC), was operating a rental business. He went to pack the chairs he rented out to a Celestial Church of Christ (CCC), Oshodi parish, at Olatunji Street, during its annual harvest about 8p.m. It was also learnt that when one of the invited dignitaries, who was with a police escort, was leaving the venue, he was reportedly accosted by some miscreants who wanted to collect money from him. Witnesses said while the policeman was trying to disperse the surging miscreants he fired some shots into the air, one of which hit Waliu in the head. He died on the spot. Witnesses said Waliu’s death was mysterious because he was far from the spot the policeman fired the shot. When our correspondent visited the house of the victim at Ladipo area of Oshodi to speak with his widow, she was said to have relocated to her parents’ house at Abeokuta after the incident. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Bala Elkana, said the case was under investigation.  Elkana added that detectives at the Homicide Section of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID), Panti, Yaba, were investigating the circumstances surrounding Wilu’s death.
