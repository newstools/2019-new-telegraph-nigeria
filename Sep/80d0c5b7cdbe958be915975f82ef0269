The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said about 201,143 permanent voter’s cards (PVCs) were yet to be collected by their owners in Kogi and Bayelsa states, less than three days to the period allowed for the collection.  The commission, however, said as at September 20, it has distributed 17, 250 PVCs in the two states within this period. A breakdown of the figures showed that a total of 163, 856 PVCs are uncollected in Kogi State while 7,044 have been collected by their owners. In Bayelsa State, the figure is 37,287 PVCs uncollected while 10, 206 PVCs were distributed. INEC had begun distribution of PVCs in the two states on September 2 and will close on September 30.  The commission will hold governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states on November 16. Meanwhile, INEC has identified barriers to participation of Nigerian women in politics. Its Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, at a review meeting of 2019 general elections from gender perspective in Abuja yesterday said the disparities between male and female access to power and resources, played out in the 2019 general elections. Represented by a National Commissioner, Dr. Adekunle Ogunmola, the INEC chairman noted that only five out of the 73 candidates who ran in the last presidential election were women.  “Also, 1,668 men and 232 women contested for the 109 senatorial seats while 4,139 men and 533 women contended for 360 seats in the House of Representatives. “At the end of the election, only seven women won senatorial seats and 11 were elected into the House of Representatives, while four were elected as deputy governors,” he said. Yakubu said Nigeria is the least among countries in sub-Saharan Africa with low participation of women in politics.
