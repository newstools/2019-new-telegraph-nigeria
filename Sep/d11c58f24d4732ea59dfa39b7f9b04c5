The National and State Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, on Monday, nullified the election of Hon. Kolapo Korede Osunsanya, representing Ijebu Central Federal Constituency. Osunsanya, popularly known as KKO, is a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Taiwo Shote, had filed a petition challenging the declaration of the APC candidate as winner of the February 23, 2019 election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). But delivering its judgement, the tribunal, led by Justice Wakkil Alkali Gana, upheld Shoteâ€™s petition and cancelled elections in two units and an entire ward in the Ijebu Central Federal Constituency. The Ijebu Central Federal Constituency comprises three local government areas including Ijebu-Ode, Ijebu North East and Odogbolu. The tribunal specifically cancelled elections in Ward 5, Unit 5 in Ijebu Ode Local Government; Ward 10, Unit 3 in Odogbolu Local Government and the entire Ward 8 in Ijebu North East Local Government in the constituency. It held that since the margin of lead and difference between the petitioner and 1st respondent was less than 4,000 and the total number of cancelled votes was 8,800, the INEC ought not to have declared Osunsanya as winner of the election in line with the provisions of the Electoral Act. However, delivering judgement on two other petitions, the tribunal upheld the election of Senator Tolu Odebiyi, representing Ogun West Senatorial District, and Hon. Jimoh Ojugbele, representing Ota Federal Constituency. It ruled that the petitioners failed to prove their allegations of rigging and other electoral malpractices against both Odebiyi and Ojugbele, who are members of the ruling APC.
