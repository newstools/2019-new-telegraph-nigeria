A mother and her two children have died after eating yam flour (amala) at Odo-Ayedun Ekiti in Ikole Local Government Area of Ekiti State. The head of the family was rushed to the hospital where doctors were still battling to save his life. But the family’s two dogs who ate out of the meal also died. The lawmaker representing Ikole Constituency 2 in the state House of Assembly, Hon. Steven Aribasoye, disclosed this yesterday to journalists. Aribasoye, who had earlier raised the issue at the plenary of the House where he called for sympathy and investigation into the matter, explained that the flour, which was procured by the husband, was prepared by his wife on Saturday and was served as dinner for the family. He added that after eating the meal, the mother and her two children complained of stomach ache but died one after the other while the father was currently at the Federal Teaching Hospital, Ido-Ekiti. According to him, the cause of the incident is still unknown as members of the community are still in shock. Aribasoye, however, lamented the poor state of health facilities in the community. The Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Funminiyi Afuye, condoled with Aribasoye and the entire people of his constituency for the tragic incident. Afuye ordered the House Committee on Health to begin investigation into the matter.
