The Nigerian Army yesterday announced the killing of seven suspected Boko Haram commanders during joint operations between its troops and elements of Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF). The Army further reiterated earlier claims that the suspected terrorists were fleeing to North and Central Africa, to escape the heat from ongoing operations in the North East. Acting Director of Army Public Relations (DAPR), Col. Sagir Musa, who made the disclosure in a statement yesterday, noted that the said feat has since attracted the commendation of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt-Gen. Tukur Buratai. “The MNJTF and the Nigerian Armed Forces are in celebrative mood today and have been basking in the successes of their combined efforts of artillery and air bombardments of suspected hideouts of erstwhile Boko Haram/ISWAP at the Tumbus of Lake Chad region that neutralised many including key commanders. “However, it was mourning and a monumental set back to the erstwhile Boko Haram/ISWAP fighters hibernating at the triangular area. “Reliable information coming out from the inner circles of the demented and criminal group’s enclave escaping to Sudan and Central African Republic, indicated that about seven of their key commanders have been wasted by the superior forces of the MNJTF. “The neutralised commanders are said to be Abba Mainok, Bukar Dunokaube, Abu kololo, Abor Kime (said to be of Arab origin – likely their ISIS trainer), Mann Chari, Dawoud Abdoulaye (from Mali) and Abu Hamza,” Musa said He added that: “All these were said to be commanders of various Tumbus controlling fighters before they were decisively dealt with and sent to the pit of hell by the military bombardment. “Although these names may be not be real and may likely be nicknames and alias, nonetheless, it is an unprecedented feat to our quest of clearing the remnants of these criminals in the area. Consequently, efforts are ongoing to get more information on their true identities.
