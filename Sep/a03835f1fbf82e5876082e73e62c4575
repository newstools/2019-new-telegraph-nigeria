The Ministry of Petroleum Resources has intervened in the on-going litigation by Nembe communities in Bayelsa State against AITEO, an oil company operating in the community and hosts to Oil Mining Lease (OML 29), urging both parties to settle out of court. A Federal High Court sitting in Yenagoa had on June 24 declined an application to halt the renewal of OML 29 pending, the determination of a suit by the Nembe communities. At the resumed hearing on Friday, Counsel to the plaintiffs, Mr A. Eyinda told the court that officials of Ministry of Petroleum Resources had proposed an amicable resolution of the face-off. He explained that the ministry had prepared a draft Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for resolution of all the issues in the suit by the parties and sought the input of the communities at a meeting scheduled for August 27 which did not hold. However, Counsel to the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Mr Agbade S. Agbade said that although he was aware of the disposition of his client for an out of court settlement, he had no update to give the court without recourse to his client. Eyinda expressed the desire of the plaintiffs to continue with the case while hoping that the settlement option proposed by the Petroleum resources will yield fruit. The defendants are Attorney-General of the Federation, Minister of Petroleum Resources, Federal Ministry of Environment and Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria. Others are Aiteo Exploration and Production Ltd, Attorney-General of Bayelsa and The Deeds Registrar, Bayelsa Ministry of Lands.
