The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, yesterday, donated drugs worth over N60 million to the Borno State Government for onward distribution to the victims of insurgency in the state. The Speakerâ€™s gesture came after his visit to some internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Maiduguri, Borno State, in July. Represented by his Chief of Staff, Sanusi Garba Rikiji, the Speaker presented the drugs to the leader of the Borno State Caucus in the House and the Chief Whip, Mohammed Tahir Monguno, who received them on behalf of the state government. The Speaker, who made the presentation in his office in Abuja, said the drugs comprised antibiotics and other essential drugs that would cure infectious diseases among the IDPs. It would be recalled that the Speaker had equally visited the IDPs in Zamfara and Katsina states where he donated items, including drugs and foodstuff. In his votes of thanks, the leader of the Borno State Caucus in the House, Monguno thanked the Speaker on behalf of the state governor, Prof. Babagana Umara Zulum, saying the gesture would go a long way in ameliorating the health challenges of the IDPs. Monguno said Gbajabiamila was the first Speaker of the House, who deemed it fit to visit Borno State mainly to feel the plight of the IDPs despite the security situation, thanking him for being an exemplary leader. He said the Borno State Government would ensure the judicious use of the drugs in a manner that would affect the lives of all the IDPs positively.
