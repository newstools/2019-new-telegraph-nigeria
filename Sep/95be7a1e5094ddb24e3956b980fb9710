Following the appointment of three members of the executive of the Lagos State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as commissioner and special advisers in Lagos State Executive Council by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the party leadership has appointed former member of Lagos House of Assembly from Ojo II Constituency, Hon. Lanre Ogunyemi and ex-Commissioner for Special Duties, Hon. Oluseye Oladejo as APC Secretary and Publicity Secretary respectively. Ogunyemi, who was a former Secretary of Alliance for Democracy (AD) in Lagos State, succeeded the immediate past Secretary, Dr. Wale Ahmed, who is currently Commissioner for Special Duties and Intergovernmental Relations. Oladejo, a former Chairman of Mushin Local Government Area and one-time Special Adviser to ex-Governor Babatunde Fashola on Commerce and Industry, replaced Engr. Joe Igbokwe, who is currently Special Adviser to Governor Sanwo-Olu on Drainage and Water Resources. New Telegraph learnt from a reliable source on Friday that Ogunyemi and Oladejo were announced as Acting Secretary and Acting Publicity Secretary respectively during the Lagos APC executive meeting on Thursday. It was gathered that the duo emerged through a consensus arrangement in acting capacity base on the decision of the party’s leadership as no election was conducted to fill the vacant position. “Ogunyemi and Oladejo were appointed as Secretary and Publicity Secretary during the party’s executive meeting on Thursday. Both of them will act in acting capacity until the party hold its state congress to feel the vacant positions in the State Executive Council,” the source told New Telegraph.
