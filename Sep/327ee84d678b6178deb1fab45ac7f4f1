An Ikeja Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Court, Lagos on Monday heard how a 27-year-old school bus driver, Afeez Balogun, allegedly defiled a two-year-old pupil (name withheld) of Holbrook School, Gbagada.
The victim’s mother (identity withheld), who narrated the incident to the court, said that the Balogun defiled her baby sometime in July 2018 at the premises of Holbrook Creche Nursery and Primary School, Pedro, Gbagada, Lagos.
Balogun is standing trial for allegedly having sexual intercourse with a child contrary to Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015.
While being led in evidence by the State Prosecutor, Mrs Fehinti Ogbemudia, the victim’s mother said that the defendant was a school bus driver for her daughter’s former school.
According to the witness: “Balogun was the bus driver for my daughter’s former school called Holbrook Schools located at Gbagada. My daughter is currently three-years and 11-months old and she is currently in Nursery one.
“On July 5, 2018, my daughter woke up to ease herself at around 12.30am and while she was easing herself, she was crying and her terminology then was that ‘my bum-bum is paining me’.
“I tried to find out what the problem was and I took her to the bedroom and my husband and I asked her some questions and I asked her if anyone had hurt her bum-bum and she said yes,” the mother said.
The witness further said that immediately, that morning, she went to the school with her daughter and informed the school administrators about the development.
