 S uper Eagles Coach, Gernot Rohr, has said he will not make any fresh approach to convince Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham to commit his international future to Nigeria.  Tammy has already represented England at the youth cadre but still remains eligible to represent Nigeria with his fine start to the season prompting calls for Nigeria to push for him once again.  But Super Eagles Manager, Rohr said: “Tammy knows what to do if he wants to play for his fatherland.”  The Franco- German said Nigeria has a crop of good players that can deliver at the big stage and not ready to go on knees for any player.  “We have already sold our plans to him before his current run of goals for Chelsea.”   “I think we have done on our part on Tammy, now it’s up to him because he knows what to do if he wants to play for Nigeria. Like I said we are focused on the best players only for Nigeria and if he makes himself one then we are open to having him,” Rohr said.   “The idea is to call the best players available for selection so there’s a chance we call players who want to play for us without making a public show off it. We are happy for any Nigerian player doing well,” Rohr explained.  The Eagles handler was however silent on Tammy’s teammate Fikayo Tomori who has also excelled in the past few games in central defence and also scored a spectacular goal against Wolverhampton Wanderers two weeks ago.
