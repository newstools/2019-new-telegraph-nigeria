Unknown gunmen on Sunday abducted a stalwart of the Ijaw Youths Council (IYC) Worldwide and younger brother of governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Comrade Robert Igali, and three others along Elele Community in Rivers State while on a visit to Bayelsa State-bound accident victims in the hospital.
The accident victims, according to eyewitness account, were returning from the marriage ceremony of one of the aides of the member representing Southern Ijaw Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Hon. Preye Oseke.
It was learnt that they were returning from the marriage ceremony which they attended in Mbaise Council Area of Imo State when the bus they boarded got involved in an accident.
It was further learnt that Igali and three of his friends, who on hearing the news, rushed to the scene of the accident from Yenagoa, were kidnapped by unknown gunmen at Madonna University Teaching Hospital in Elele Community where the accident victims were receiving treatment.
According eyewitness account, one Mr. Prince Ekete, who was also involved in the accident, died on the spot.
One of the accident victims, who is said to be responding to treatment at the time of filing this report, Miss. Dini Adiva, posted these words on Facebook some hours ago: “I see you all, I can’t reply all your posts & messages for now but I am grateful.
“Also pray for those that were kidnapped while trying to make arrangements to move us from Madonna University, Elele to Yenagoa, that they come out unhurt.
“This is a trying time for me and I know it will pass. I appreciate all your love and support, I’m yet to seat upright and walk, it will take me some time. Ebinebo Stample and others too are recuperating well.”
The kidnappers, according to sources, have contacted the family of Igali, and are said to be demanding N5 million as ransom of their son and the others.
