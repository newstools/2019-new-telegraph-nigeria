T he leadership of Ohaneze Ndigbo has challenged governors of the South-East region to provide palliatives for Nigerians returning from South Africa following xenophobic attacks.   President of the Ohanaeze-Ndigbo Abuja chapter, Odozi Nwodozi stated this yesterday while briefing journalists on preparation for the 2019 Igbo day celebration billed for Abuja on 29th September, 2019 with the theme “Promoting a culture of peace for socio-economic development.”   He said: “The South-East governors must put things on the ground to assist those returning from South Africa, the bulk of who are Igbo people. We call them to use this opportunity to put infrastructure that will cushion the effect of their unplanned dislocation.   “However, with the return of our brothers and sisters, Ohanaeze is not empowered economically to assist but I am sure the states and the federal government must have done things to make sure that those people coming back don’t feel the effect of their unexpected disengagement from South Africa.   “Knowing the role that Nigeria played in the liberation of South Africa. Nigeria was a frontline state in that struggle. Nigeria in the 70s took responsibility in not only nurturing but empowering those that are today, leaders in South Africa. I am also aware that Nelson Mandela in the heydays of his struggle was quartered in Igboland, precisely in the house of the one we call the boy is good, Chief Mbazurike Amaechi, the only surviving minister of the first republic.   “For South Africans to at this stage start behaving the way that they are doing is quite unfortunate.”
