Following the controversy trailing the names released by the Federal Government on the new Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) board, a rights group known as, Centre for Human Rights and Anti-corruption Crusade (CHRAC), has filed a lawsuit at the Federal High Court sitting in Warri against President Muhammadu Buhari and the Senate President challenging the appointment.
InÂ a suit no: FHC/WR/CS/100/2019, the group is praying for the nullification of the purported appointment of the Chairman of the Governing Board for being inconsistent with the NDDC (Establishment) Act, 2000.
In a statement signed by Publicity Secretary, the right group frowned at the manner in which the appointment took place, saying due process was not followed in the appointments.
As at the time of filing the report, no date had been fixed for the hearing of the matter as courts are still on vacation.
