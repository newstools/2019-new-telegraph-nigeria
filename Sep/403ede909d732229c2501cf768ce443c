Captain Giorgio Chiellini also misses out because of his serious knee injury. Juventus boss Maurizio Sarri has included six new signings, including Wales midfielder Aaron Ramsey. The Serie A side are in a group with Spanish club Atletico Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen of the Bundesliga and Russia’s Lokomotiv Moscow. This year’s group stage begins on Tuesday, September 17 and the final is on Saturday, May 30, 2020 at the Ataturk Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey, reports the BBC.
