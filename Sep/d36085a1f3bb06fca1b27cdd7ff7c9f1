Police have apprehended two men for specialising in snatching mobile phones from unsuspecting members of the public in Minna, Niger State. The suspects, Yusuf Ibrahim (32), who lives behind Central Mosque, Minna and Abbas Sabiu (20) of Angwan Daji area, Minna, were arrested by policemen from the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) while on surveillance around Obasanjo Shopping Complex and Kasuwan Gwari. It was learnt yesterday that the suspects had snatched two phones from Zulkibulu of Kasuwan Gwari and Musa Badamasi of Dutsen-kura Hausa, Minna. The suspects earned their living by dispossessing innocent members of the public of their handsets and other valuables. The suspects, according to the police, used dangerous weapons while operating. One of the suspects, Ibrahim, their victims hardly refused to surrender their phones on a lonely road knowing that nobody would come to their rescue. He said: “They always give us their phones without stress and quietly walk away from us. “We have been in this act for more than two years, and we have been succeeding in snatching people’s phones and selling them at giveaway prices.” The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Muhammad Abubakar, said the suspects confessed to the crime. Abubakar said the operatives recovered from them, one Vivo handset and one Itel phone. He added that the matter would be charged to court soon.
