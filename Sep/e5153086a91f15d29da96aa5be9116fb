Following unfriendly business environment, AG Leventis Nigeria Plc. has commenced moves to exit the local bourse. Chris Ugwu reports   A G Leventis Plc, like some other conglomerates, has seen a sustainable loss position in bottom line as the effect of hash operating environment continues to impact adversely on its operations due to reduction in credit opportunities, which has affected the company’s income. This harsh environment along with lag in infrastructure especially power and road network has added to cost of doing business, which impacted negatively on investment returns that has prevented AG Leventis from  paying dividends since 2015.  A.G Leventis Nigeria Plc paid a dividend of N264.729 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The dividend, which translated to 10 kobo per share, was recommended despite the fact that the group recorded a loss of N177 million.  The company’s activities have definitely been negatively impacted mainly by increase in tariff, double taxation, depreciation in naira and continued insecurity prevailing in some parts of the country, a situation that has compelled scaling back of its expansion drive in those regions.  Given headwinds such as weak demand on the back of household wallets, most consumer goods companies in Nigerian have been finding it difficult to weather the storm. The auto sector like its counterparts in other developing countries has also been facing challenges that are retarding growth potential.  Such impediments, which include disparity in tariffs, external competition, high production costs, smuggling, inaccessibility of finance, absence of functional industrial clusters for production of automobile, and lack of modern technology led to recent proposal by the parent company to acquire the Nigerian unit and also delist from the local bourse.  In Nigeria, about 109 companies have been delisted from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) in the last 17 years either voluntarily or involuntarily, and this has become a source of worry to both the regulators and shareholders.   AG Leventis, which finished at a loss position in the year 2017, though marginally returned to profitability in the 2018, began the year 2019 unimpressive to finish the first and second quarters at loss positions that market analysts attributed to weak consumer demands, stiffer competition and increased financing cost. The share price, which closed at 36 kobo per share in October 2018, has recorded a dip in growth that when the closing bell rang on Friday, the company’s share price stood at 26 kobo, a decline of 10 kobo or 28 per cent year to date.

Operating challenges   Chairman, AG Leventis, Ahmed Kazalma Mantey, speaking at the group’s 59th Annual General Meeting (AGM), said: “The effect of the recession in our economy continued to impact adversely on our operations as there was a reduction in credit opportunities which in turn affected our income. This harsh environment along with the continued lag in infrastructure especially power and road network added to our cost of doing business. Nevertheless, we strove to ensure that we continued to develop our business as much as possible.” Moves to acquire Nigeria unit, delists from NSE   AG. Leventis (Nigeria) Plc last week notified NSE that Boval S.A acting on behalf of itself, Leventis Holding S.A., and Leventis Overseas Limited had approached the board of directors of the company with an intention to acquire the shares held by other shareholders of the company at an offer price of 53 kobo per share and subsequently delist the company from the exchange.   The offer price of 53 kobo, according to a statement signed by Bola Adebisi (Ms.), Company Secretary/Legal Adviser, represents a premium of 85 per cent to the 60-day volume weighted average share price and 104 per cent to the Company’s closing share price on September 23, 2019.   The proposed transaction will be implemented under a Scheme of Arrangement in line with section 539 of the Companies and Allied Matters Act, Cap C.20 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004. “The proposed transaction is still subject to the review and clearance of the Nigerian Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the approval of the shareholders of the company.  “The terms and conditions of the proposed transaction will be provided in the Scheme Document, which will be dispatched to all shareholders following the receipt of the “no-objection” of the regulators and an order from the Federal Hiqh Court to convene a Court-Ordered Meeting. “Further developments will be communicated to shareholders in due course. AGL shareholders are advised to exercise caution in dealing in AGL’s shares until further information is provided,” she said. Shareholders’ stance   Shareholders have expressed concerns over the rising wave of delisting of quoted companies by the regulatory authorities, saying it does not augur well for average investors and the nation’s capital market.   Mr. Adeleke Adebayo of the Independent Shareholders Association of Nigeria (ISAN) urged capital market regulators to allow listed companies that are not meeting the post-listing requirements to remain a ‘public focus.’   He argued that institutional investors may develop interest in such companies and decide to invest in them. “We are losing a lot of money in the market. Nobody is thinking of giving forbearance to investors. We need to make some price adjustments not to continue to delist companies because it is not good for average investors. Let it remain a public focus. Some investors can develop interest and invest in these companies,” he said.  Last line Though high cost of operations have remarkably weighed down on  AG Leventis,  while market regulators are of the view that delisting by quoted companies especially multinationals poses a threat to the development and growth of the capital market, shareholders believe the action has not given investors the desired benefits as it lacks protection of shareholders’ funds.
