  F ormer Wimbledon FC striker, John Fashanu, has warned Chelsea’s current sensation, Tammy Abraham, to beware of being lured to play for the Three Lions, The English senior national team.   Fashanu who once choosed England over Nigeria told young Tammy during a television programme monitored in Abuja to learn from mistakes made by Nigerians like him, Gabriel Agbonlahor, late Ugo Ehiogu, Nedum Onuoha and Jordon Ibe, who only played few matches for England because of stiff competitions. “So, I say to Tammy, think very well. When I went to play for England I could have played 100 games for the Super Eagles.    “But I got to play only two games for England (in 1989). Understand that if you are going to play for England, you are going to play four or five matches only because competition is stiff,” Fashanu told Tammy.   “When I got to Nigeria myself and I came three times, I realized that Nigeria football and English football are completely different. Nigerian football was taken from the Brazilians but football in England is rough, bullish and aggressive, completely different. That was many years ago,” Fashanu said. “I realized that I could not play the Nigerian football. I was happy that as a black Nigerian, I would be able to break into the English national team.  ”Possibly one of the best and biggest country in the world certainly then it was wonderful. To play with Paul Gascoigne, Peter Shilton, they were legends.  Abraham has scored seven Premier League goals in the current 2019/2020 season and was not considered for the 2018 World Cup by England.
