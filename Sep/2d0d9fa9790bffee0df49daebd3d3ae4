Nigeria was ranked 33rd in the world in the last rankings but they currently occupied the 34th position according to the August/September 2019 edition. The team only last week played a 2-2 draw against Ukraine in an international friendly game at the Dnipro Stadium, their first game after the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, where the team finished third. Coach Gernot Rohr’s men, however, gained one point, cumulating 1482 points from the previous 1481 points. In the African ranking, Nigeria maintained its third place despite the drop in the world ranking, with Senegal and Tunisia also maintaining their first and second positions respectively. Algeria climbed two places in the world rankings and are fourth on the African ranking behind Nigeria, while Morocco, Egypt, Ghana, Cameroon, Congo DR, and Cote D’Ivoire occupy the fifth to tenth positions respectively. Meanwhile, Belgium remained top of the world ranking, with France, Brazil, England, and Portugal making up the top 5. Belgium continues to hold its place as the topmost country on the FIFA world rankings. Uruguay, Spain, Croatia, Colombia and Argentina are the other countries who make up the top 10 of the latest FIFA rankings. The next edition is expected to be announced on October 24.
