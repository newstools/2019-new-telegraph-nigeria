There is heightened anxiety in Minna, as Niger State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal will on Wednesday rule on the petition challenging the re-election of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger State. All major junctions and offices in the state capital are manned by Policemen, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps and other security agencies. The tribunal had concluded its sitting in July and fixed September 18 (Wednesday) to pass its verdict on the petition filed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its governorship candidate, Alhaji Umar Nasko following the adoption of final written addresses by parties in the matter. When our Correspondent spoke to the Umar Nasko campaign’s Director of Communications Usman Baba Yahaya, he said: “We are calling on the judges to do the right thing, as the fate of Nigerlites now hang on them.”
