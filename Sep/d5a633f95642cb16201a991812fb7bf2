Majority of young people in Nigeria are not empowered with quality information to make informed decisions about their reproductive health. These are contained in a statement issued by Programme Director, Development Communication Network (Devcoms), Mr Akin Jimoh to mark the 2019 World Contraceptive Day, which is commemorated on September 26.As the country commemorates this year’s World Contraception Day with the theme: ‘It’s Your Life, It’s Your Responsibility,’ there is an urgent need to improve awareness of the importance of abstinence as well as contraception to enable young people make informed choices on their sexual and reproductive health, he said.To boost Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) and to also serve as a method to curb population explosion, Development Communications Network (Devcoms) Programme Director Akin Jimoh, says “abstinence is a priority recommended means for young people but in reality for a number of this group the increase in the use of contraception will help curb teenage pregnancies and eliminate a scenario whereby a baby who is supposed to still be under the tutelage of her mother is expecting another baby in her womb”.According to him, lack of education about responsible sexuality poses a threat to the lives of the girl child in Nigeria.Should Nigeria refuse to take action on unwanted and underage pregnancies the country will continue to have high rate of unsafe abortion as reported in several studies, Jimoh stated. The 2018 Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 (PMA2020) Abortion Survey Results states that about four to six per cent of women of reproductive age had a likely abortion in the 12 months prior to the study indicating that 1.8 to 2.7 million abortions occur annually in Nigeria.However, he reasoned that family planning allows the woman to rest between pregnancies in order to regain her health and strength and enable her to have a healthy child and thereby reducing the incidence of maternal mortality in Nigeria.Bless-me Ajani, the Youth Programme Officer, Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative (NURHI) 2, Lagos asserted that: “One thing that still echoes very loudly are the numerous barriers and challenges young people face in accessing contraception information and services.”
