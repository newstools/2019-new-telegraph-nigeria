O sun State Government has described comments by Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State on the running of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) that tended to suggest that Osun had abandoned payment of workers of the institution as a product of misinformation.   It said the state had always been alive to its responsibility with regard to its obligations to LAUTECH despite the obvious lopsidedness in the distribution of infrastructure between the two owner states.   A statement from the Office of the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Prince Wole Oyebamiji, yesterday, noted that Osun had never defaulted in the payment of salaries of workers in both the university and the Teaching Hospital in Osogbo.   According to it, while Oyo in 2017 contributed N717, 888, 795.00, Osun contributed N1, 292, 000, 000.00 and in 2018, Oyo contributed N443, 865,554.00; Osun contributed N500, 000,000.   The government was, however, quick to add that in addition to contributing regularly to LAUTECH in Ogbomoso as indicated above, Osun State alone had been responsible for paying the salaries of workers at LAUTECH Teaching Hospital, Osogbo from 2013 to date, amounting to N16, 369, 953, 830.48.   For instance, from January to June this year, while Oyo had paid about N1.1billion to the university, Osun, on the other hand, had paid about N1.7 billion from January to July this year to LAUTECH Teaching Hospital. This, it said was in addition to the N300 million it released to the university in July.   It said: “Effectively, what this implies is that while Osun had cumulatively spent about N2 billion on the institution from January to date, Oyo had only spent a little over N1billion.  “From the foregoing, who has defaulted? Rather than attempt to vilify our government, we should be commended. The university is a joint responsibility.  Whatever decision that needs to be taken on its future must be mutually agreed upon.   “Again, for emphasis, we are committed to the joint ownership of LAUTECH and we will never shy away from our responsibilities, just as we will never sacrifice the future of the students of the university on the altar of partisan politics.”
