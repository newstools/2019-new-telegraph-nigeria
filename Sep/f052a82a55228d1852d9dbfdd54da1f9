From Musa Pam, Jos The National and State House of Assembly Petition Tribunal sitting in Jos, Plateau State, on Tuesday struck out the petition filed by the Candidate of the United Progressive Party (UPP) Sanusi Moh’d Inuwa challenging the election of Senator Istifanus Dung Gyang of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the winner of the Plateau North Senatorial seat. Delivering judgement, Chairman of the Tribunal Hon. Justice Theophilus Nzeogwu held that the petition cannot be sustained and struck out the petition on that ground that the petitioner had woefully failed to prove his case. “The petitioner failed to prove his petition because he did not tender any document to show that he was indeed validly nominated to contest for the Plateau North Senatorial District,” the Tribunal Chairman said. UPP had earlier informed the tribunal that Inuwa was nominated for the Plateau South Senatorial District and not Plateau North Senatorial District as claimed by Inuwa. In his response, defence counsel, Barrister Niri Doron said it was a welcome development noting that they had proved that the petitioner had no case against his client.
