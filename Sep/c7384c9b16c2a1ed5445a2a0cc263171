The Governor of Bayelsa State Henry Seriake Dickson on Tuesday advised PDP members and supporters in the state to be calm and focused adding  that a final decision on the issue of running mate for Douye Diri the party flag bearer for November 16 governorship election would be taken after exhaustive consultations and deliberations with the critical stakeholders. The governor, in a statement in Yenagoa, the state capital, issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Fidelis Soriwei, said that the critical stakeholders of the Bayelsa PDP, including  former President Goodluck Jonathan, and other leaders would take a  final decision on the issue of the running mate. Dickson urged PDP members in Bayelsa  to avoid playing into the hands of the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC). He said that the APC, which is not on the ground in Bayelsa, was only banking on federal might to win the election. He said that the controversy over running mate was simply normal in politics which is not peculiar to the PDP and its candidate in Bayelsa.
