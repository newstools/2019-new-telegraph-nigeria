The National Assembly and State House Assembly Elections Petition Tribunal sitting in Ikeja Tuesday affirmed and declared Senator Solomon Adeola (Yayi) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) winner of the February 23 Lagos West Senatorial constituency elections. Mr Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had filed a petition challenging emerging victory of Adeola at the elections before the tribunal. While delivering the judgment, the three-man tribunal, led by Justice Kunaza Hamidu, held that the petition filed by Rhodes-Vivour challenging the election failed as a result of the petitioner’s inability to establish a prima facie case against Adeola. The tribunal held that the petitioner failed to substantiate and give particulars of all allegations raised against the election. According the three-man panel: “The petitioner failed to show the exact scores as claimed thereby rubbishing their petition before the tribunal. “The witnesses are those who were present on the day of the election. Therefore, the failure of the petitioner to present the exact scores has thereby rubbished their claims. “The petitioner did not also present any of their polling agents.”
