Music superstar, Tiwa Savage, took to her social media pages to reveal that she would no longer be performing at the South African Food & Music Festival due to the recent spate of xenophobic attacks in the country. She wrote; “I refuse to watch the barbaric butchering of my people in SA. This is sick. For this reason I will not be performing at the upcoming DStv Delicious Festival in Johannesburg on the September 21. My prayers are with all the victims and families affected by this.” The broadcaster has had to break its silence on her strong-worded stance. It assured fans of safety and that no hate-crimes would be accepted. The statement reads; “As a Festival, we have always been an inclusive event with our gates open to everybody, irrespective of where they come from. We do not tolerate any form of discrimination and will continue to ensure that the festival is a safe and inclusive place for all.” Tiwa is not the only star to cancel an upcoming show. Nigerian comedian, Basketmouth, has also cancelled an upcoming event due to the attacks. And South Africa’s Mlindo, the vocalist, has cancelled his planned concert in Zimbabwe. He tweeted, “I’m supposed to travel to Zimbabwe this weekend, but I fear for my life since I’m South African. My country is doing so much harm to our brothers and sisters I have no choice but to wonder what lies in another African country as an African?”
