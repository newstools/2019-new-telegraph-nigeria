Four Nigeria police officials attached to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) have been arrested for shooting an unidentified youth to death in Lagos.  Nigeria police are yet to release the names of the officers that killed the man at Akodo, Ajah area of Lagos State. An eyewitness said one of the policemen shot the man to death and tried putting the victim in their vehicle but were resisted by sympathisers at the scene. Spokesman for the Lagos State Police Command, Bala Elkana, confirmed the report to our correspondent, saying: “It is true. We have commenced investigation.”  The police spokesman said the names of the erring officers will be made public after investigation. He assured the public of a speedy conclusion of the investigation “as we have done in the past.”  A civil rights activist and #EndSARS convener, Segun Awosanya, popularly known as Segalink on social media, said he confirmed from a police source that an investigation was ongoing into the incident. Awosanya disclosed that the four SARS operatives had been handed directives for another operation by a police DPO but went elsewhere and perpetrated the killing.
