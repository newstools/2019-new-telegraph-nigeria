 “I had sex with her because I have been waiting for the day like this and I am ready for the consequence; let the law take its course.”   This was the confession of a 32-year-old man, Nura Abudullahi, who was arrested by the police for allegedly defiling a 14-year-old girl in Suleja Local Government Area of Niger State.   The suspect was trailed and arrested by a team of policemen attached to A Division, Suleja, following a tip-off.   It was learnt that a man, Yahaya Danlami, of Mallam Shehu area of Suleja had reported to the police on August 24, 2019, that his niece left home but did not return until next day.   New Telegraph learnt that the suspect lured and locked her in his room and forcibly raped her till the next day, not minding whether her guardians would look for her.   Checks also revealed that the suspect had been abusing little girls of that area until he met his waterloo.   The suspect told our correspondent that his victim was bigger than her age; that was the reason “why I had sex with her not being afraid of anything”.   Confirming the incident, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Muhammad Abubakar, on Sunday said the suspect confessed to the crime. Abubakar said the matter would be charged to court after investigation.
