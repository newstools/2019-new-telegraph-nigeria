Following an alleged denial of visa to 10,000 lawyers for this year’s African Bar Association (AfBA) by the Egyptian’s government, the association at the weekend, shifted the 2019 annual conference earlier scheduled to hold at the Triumph Luxury Hotel, Cairo, Egypt from 2nd to 5th September 2019 to Monrovia, the capital of Liberia.   This followed an alleged refusal by the Egyptian government to grant entry visas to over 80 per cent of the participants across the continent, including prominent Bar leaders and lawyers.   However, Cairo’s loss is now Monrovia’s gain as the Government of Liberia under President George Weah has offered to host the 2019 AfBA annual conference.   The rescheduled conference would hold between 20th and 25th October, 2019.   In a release by AfBA’s Special Adviser (Media and Publicity), Osa Director, President Weah would declare the conference open on 21st October, 2019 with over 10,000 lawyers expected from the various Bar associations and law societies on the continent.   Meanwhile, top government functionaries and business leaders are also expected to graze the event with the theme: Tackling contemporary issues facing the continent; How lawyers can drive a renaissance.
