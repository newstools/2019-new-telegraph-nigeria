Counsel to the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Bayelsa State, F. N Nwosu has said the party will explore every legal means to get justice against the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate in the November 16 governorship election in the state, Hon. David Lyon, and his running mate, Degi Biobarakuma. PDP gubernatorial candidate, Senator Diri Duoye and his running mate Senator, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo had gone to court, seeking the disqualification of APC candidate for wrongful nomination.   An APC member, Peter Ozobo had earlier gone to court claiming a default in the conduct of the party primary that produced Lyon as the party’s governorship candidate. Ozobo, in the suit no: FHC/ABJ/CS/1095, said the primary that produced Lyon did not follow the approved party guidelines, alleging that APC did not hold direct primary elections at all the wards in the state.  He also claimed that majority of the party members were excluded from voting in the election while results were written at the wards where primaries did not hold. Attempts to serve Lyon and his running mate the court processes have not been successful, as they had reportedly dodged the court’s bailiff.  The APC candidates allegedly evaded the bailiff, one Victor, both in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital and at NICON Luxury Hotel Abuja where he was directed, and even at the Abuja home of Minister of Petroleum (State), Chief Timipre Sylva. Nwosu, who spoke on the frustrations in serving the defendants the court summon, recalled that similar abuse and disregard of court processes cost APC Rivers and Zamfara states in the last general elections. Asked whether he would seek for substituted service, Nwosu said: “This cannot be ruled out.  “There is no way such illegality should be allowed to stand. It is not good for the nation’s democracy.”
