Nollywood actor and producer, Kunle Afolayan, has cancelled his planned visit to Durban, South Africa. He was scheduled to visit the country along with some other partners on a fun tour. The Nollywood actor said that he cancelled his visit because of the current Xenophobic attacks on foreigners. Afolayan, while speaking in a video he made to apologise for the inconveniences the cancellation might have caused, said, “South Africa is not a safe place for people to go right now. And I don’t think anybody should go to South Africa until our brothers and sisters over there come to their senses”. He further stated that the new destination for his tour would be announced in due course. That way, Afolayan has joined other celebrities like Tiwa Savage, Wizkid, Burna Boy, Davido, Teni and Genevieve to condemn the attack and also cancel their visits to the country.
