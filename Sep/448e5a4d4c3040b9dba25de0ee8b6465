Renaissance Group, a socio-cultural-political organisation based in Lagos State yesterday maintained that the campaigns of calumny against former Governor Akinwunmi Ambode would continue to fail in the face of logic as the man lives in the minds of the people. In a statement issued by its Chairman, Daniel Awesu and Secretary General, Abdul- Quadri Enikanolaiye, noted that: “In a democracy, genuine protests and criti- cism are permitted. However, sponsored and moneyinduced protests and attacks by faceless and disgruntled elements are harmful to any democracy and social wellbeing of a society. “Lies, propaganda, deliberate pull-him-down syndrome, ill-informed vituperations can only expose the state and a political party, in this case, the All Progressives Congress (APC), to needless cracks and invasion by political enemies.  “The sponsored protest orchestrated by some hired street urchins in Lagos State on Tuesday, September 24, calling for the probe of the former governor of Lagos State; Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, can only be regarded as highly despicable, unjustified, embarrassingly shameful and uncalled-for. “No doubt, this is one of the series of intentionally planned persecution and political assaults on the former governor Ambode in order to wickedly rubbish his rich and enviable credentials and pedigree.  “From the instigation of the Economic And Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) by people of known questionable character and history to investigate the former Governor; to the reprehensible display of imprudence by the Lagos State House Of Assembly (made up of 100% of the All Progressive Congress, APC) members to embark on a wild goose chase of probing the pro-people Public Bus Transportation Scheme implemented by the immediate former Governor of Lagos State who is a committed member of the APC.”
