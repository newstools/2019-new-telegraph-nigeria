Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said his administration has adopted a reformist agenda to transform the state’s healthcare sector with the Edo Primary Healthcare Improvement Programme (Edo-HIP). Obaseki said this at an interactive session with healthcare stakeholders at Government House, Benin City, the state capital, on Friday. The governor, who presented the state’s Health Improvement Programme (EDOHIP) to the stakeholders during the session, said the purpose of the interactive session was to have an honest and open discussion on how to make the state’s healthcare sector more effective and efficient. “Our healthcare system in Edo State must be restored. We want to make this state a destination for medical tourism. I don’t want to see any patient passing through Edo to other states. Rather, I want them to stop in Edo State for treatment. “Our goal as a government is to ensure that by the time we finish with all the reforms in the health sector, Edo will become the healthcare hub of the nation.” He said he was championing a reformist administration that prioritises programmes and policies that make life better for the people of the state.
