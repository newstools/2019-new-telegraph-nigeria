The South African High Commission in Nigeria has shut down its office and consulate following fears of possible attack The Acting High Commissioner, Ambassador Bobby Moroe, who confirmed the development, said he had directed the mission to suspend all consular activities until further notice. He also said none of the High Commission officials have left the country except for those on leave. The move is ostensibly in reaction to the attacks on a number of South African business concerns in Nigeria, including Shoprite, MTN and Pep. The businesses were attacked in retaliation for the latest round of xenophobic attacks on foreigners in South Africa over the weekend which saw many businesses owned by Nigerians being looted in the process in which five people lost their lives. Following the reciprocal attacks in Nigeria, the major South African companies in the country have all temporarily suspended activities until further notice. In a statement issued on Wednesday, Shoprite announced that it was also suspending trading activities in Zambia following reprisal attacks.
