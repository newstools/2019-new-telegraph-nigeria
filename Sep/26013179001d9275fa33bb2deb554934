F rom a total 233,364 connected customers, Internet services Providers (ISPs) in the country currently have 160,090 active customers. This showed that 73, 274 subscribers for the service have become inactive. A subscriber is considered inactive if he/she fails to access data services for a period of 90 days, at the minimum. Such users are separated from active customers, as they generate no revenue for the operators within the stated period. The ISPs subscription figure is in sharp contrast with that of the four mobile network operators (MNOs) whose active Internet subscribers stood at 122 million as at end of July. While there are currently 114 licensed ISPs in the country, only 41 of them have active subscribers, according to Internet Service Operators data released by Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). Industry analysts attributed the increase in MNO’s Internet subscriptions and decline in ISPs to factors of price and target customers. According to them, while a mobile subscriber can access Internet with just N100, such is not available on the ISPs services, which are targeted mainly at corporate organisations, who pay heavy charges for monthly or yearly subscriptions. Hitherto, the ISPs have been complaining about serious pressures from the MNOs who are regarded as the big players, but are also playing in the ISP space as their Universal Access Service Licence (UASL) also permits them to do so. The intense competition coupled with other operational challenges such as increasing capital and operational expenditure have been cited as the bane of the ISPs in the country. From the NCC’s data, which showed position of the ISP business as at first quarter 2019, Spectranet emerged as the leader in the ISP business, as it had the largest share of subscribers among the 41 active ISPs. Out of the 160,090 active subscriptions across the networks, Spectranet had 128,982, thus accounting for 80 per cent of the total active customers. Tizeti came second with 8,192 customers, followed by ipNX, which had 5,978 active subscribers. Other active ISPS in the country include Arrowfast Limited with 4,500 active customers, Cobranet with 3,189 active customers, Vodacom 2,021, MainOne with 1,099 customers, VDT with 913, and IS Internet Solutions 792, among others. Record of revenue by the ISPs in 2018 earlier released by NCC showed that 35 out of the 41 active operators generated N43.8 billion in the year. Analysis of the report showed that Spectranet, Main One, Infobip and Tizeti were the biggest players in the industry for the year, as they accounted for large chunk of the revenue. The report revealed that Spectranet generated N10.5 billion, thus accounting for 24 per cent of the total revenue, while MainOne garnered N9.6 billion as revenue, representing 22 per cent of the total figure. Infobip and Tizeti generated N9.1 billion (21 per cent) and N3.9 billion (9 per cent) respectively.
