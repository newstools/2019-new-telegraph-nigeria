Lagos State Deputy Governor, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, has marked his 55th birthday with a charge on parents to pay adequate attention to raising their children, saying one of Nigeria’s greatest problem is bad parenting. Speaking at a special prayer session organised to commemorate his birthday at his official residence in Ikoyi, Hamzat said his birthday message was centred on parenting, saying parents need to pay more attention to parenting since the family structure determines the success of a society. According to him, once the family structure breaks down, the society breaks down and everything goes wrong with the country. He said the biggest challenge of this country is bad behaviour of some Nigerians. He called on Nigerians irrespective of tribe, religion, profession or gender to always do the right thing in order to move the country forward and build a better society for all to live, lamenting the high level of indiscipline and social vices in the country. The deputy governor stated that Nigeria was a country that has no business with poverty, if her citizens have followed the instructions of God by being godly and doing what is right and ideal always. Hamzat said: “We are blessed but for some reasons, we have not done what God has asked us to do, that is why we are the way we are. If only we have done what God expects from us all, the country will be a better place”
