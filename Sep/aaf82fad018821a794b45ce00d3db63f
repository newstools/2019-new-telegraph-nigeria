Two notorious kidnappers who had been terrorising Kaduna, Zamfara, Sokoto and Kebbi states have been arrested in Kamba, Dandi Local Government Area of Kebbi State.  The arrest was made by the DSS from Abuja, after trailing the suspects to Kamba while some valuable items were found in their possession. Confirming the arrest to journalists in Kamba, the Sole Administrator of Dandi Local Government Council of Kebbi State, Alhaji Sale Zaria Kalakala, said the two suspects who had been terrorising the State and some parts of the country were about to escape to the neighbouring country, (Niger Republic).  He explained further that Kamba in Kebbi State shares border with Niger Republic which had been a place of concern to the people of the area as the bandits always used the advantage and move to the neighbouring country through riverine area after killing or kidnapping innocent people. “You see, we need to pray hard as they have found a base on Dolekaina area as a hideout.  The Federal Government needs to do something very urgent to curtails the menace of bandits in the area,” he added. He commended the efforts of the Kebbi State Government in supporting the security agencies and vigilantes attached to the LG by assisting them with motorcycles, Hilux cars and other important materials that will make them fight the criminals.  He appealed to the Federal Government to establish Army, Navy bases because the bandits always enter the town through the river’s while after killing or robbing people they returned through the water. In a related development, the acting Chairman of Suru Local Government Area of Kebbi State, Katune Usman, has also applauded Governor Atiku Bagudu for resolving the crisis between Fulani herdsmen and farmers in the area, adding that people of the area are now living in peace with each other.
