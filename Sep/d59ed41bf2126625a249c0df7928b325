The 123 ‘suspicious looking men’ from Jigawa State, who were arrested last week by the Lagos State Taskforce on Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences (Enforcement Unit), have slammed a N1 billion suit on the Lagos State Government over their alleged unlawful detention.
The truck conveying the men alongside 48 motorcycles were last week Friday intercepted by the task force along Moshalashi Road, Agege.
They were later moved to the State Police Command on the directives of the State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Zubairu Muazu, where they were profiled and subsequently released after nothing incriminating was found on them.
However, dissatisfied with their experience, one of the men, Abdullahi Yakubu, filed a fundamental rights enforcement suit yesterday at the Federal High Court in Lagos, on behalf of himself and others.
The Lagos State Government, Attorney-General of Lagos State, Commissioner of Police, Lagos State and Mr. Yinka Egbeyemi, the Chairman of the Taskforce, were joined as co-respondents in the suit.
The suit was brought pursuant to Sections 34, 35, 41, 42, 44 and 46 (1) of the Constitution as well as Order 4 Rules 3 and 4 of the Fundamental Right (Enforcement Procedure) Rules 2009.
