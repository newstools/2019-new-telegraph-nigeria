Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo of an Ikeja High Court, Lagos, yesterday sentenced a 39-year-old man, Femi Anthony, to 15-years in prison for defiling an 8-year-old primary school pupil (name withheld). Anthony was convicted and sentenced after being found guilty of defiling the minor in 2012 while she was doing her homework in her family’s apartment. While delivering judgement, Justice Taiwo said; “having considered all the oral and documentary evidence of the prosecution and defence, I am satisfied that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. “I, therefore, find him guilty of the defilement of PW1 (prosecution witness 1). The incidences of the offence of defilement and rape have increased astronomically in society, this sentence should serve as a deterrented. I, therefore, sentence the defendant to 15-years imprisonment with no option of fine,” Justice Taiwo said. However, according to the prosecution counsel, Mrs. K. O Sarunmi, the convict was first arraigned in court on June 23, 2014 after he had raped the 8-year-old pupil in May 20, 2012. The prosecutor said Anthony had snuck into the survivor’s (victim) flat while her mother was doing laundry downstairs. “The survivor was alone in the apartment when he came in. She was studying and doing her homework when he overpowered her and defiled her,” Sarunmi said.
