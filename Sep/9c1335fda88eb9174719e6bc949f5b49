The National/State Assembly Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Makurdi, the Benue State on Monday nullified the return of Chris Adaji of the Peoples DemocraticParty (PDP) as the winner of the 2019 Ohimini State Constituency election.
Chairman of the Tribunal, Honourable Justice R. O. Odudu, who delivered the lead judgment, held that the margin with which Adaji led Musa Alechenu Ohimini of All Progressives Congress (APC) is less than the number of votes cancelled.
According to the declaration by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Adaji led with 397 votes and the Tribunal finds the margin is less than the 1, 056 votes cancelled in the two polling units of Igbanomaje and Odega.
But according to the decision of the court, INEC ought not to have made final declaration without ordering for a rerun in the affected polling units other than declare an inconclusive poll.
Justice Odudu held that the declaration and return of Adaji without a rerun in Otega and Ogadagba ward is invalid by reason of non substantial compliance with Electoral Act 2010 (as amended).
The court therefore, issued an order for the withdrawal of the certificate of return issued to Adaji and ordeed INEC to conduct rerun elections in the two polling units where elections were cancelled within 90 days.
Vincent Tortsugh, who appeared for the petitioners, described the decision of the Tribunal as “reasonable,” adding that “we didn’t expect anything other than this.”
The APC candidate, Musa Ohimini Alechenu described the decision as a testimony of the wishes of the people.
He said by the decision, the judiciary has reaffirmed that it remains the hope of the people.
