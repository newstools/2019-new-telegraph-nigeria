  The Imo state Police Commissioner, Mr. Rabiu Ladodo has offered explanations on why he withdrew policemen attached to the state Assets Recovery Committee headed by Senior Special Assistant to Governor Emeka Ihedioha on Security, Chief Jasper Ndubuaku.   The decision, according to him was disturbing fact that the policemen deployed attached to the committee were engaging in illegal activities without the committee members.   The Police Commissioner was reacting to allegations by Ndubuaku that he denied the committee police protection which led to the brutal assault on Ndubuaku by suspected thugs loyal to former Governor Rochas Okorocha.   Speaking through a statement issued by the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Orlando Ikeokwu, the Commissioner ex plained that Ndubuaku and his committee were denied Police protection due to “complaints on hostile and aggressive approach of the committee, using armed policemen attached to the committee; complaints on constant intimidation of victims and other members of the public in the course of their operations.   It reads: “Policemen operating without the presence of the committee members and sometimes the policemen going for recovery operations on their own of which the Commissioner of Police personally intervened; operating at unholy hours in some cases only the armed Police personnel thus causing serious embarrassment to the force and the state government.  Consequent upon the said complaints, the Commissioner of Police withdrew the personnel and summoned the committee chairman, Jasper Ndubuaku.   “Ndubuaku apologized and promised to follow due process in subsequent operations. However, the reverse was the case, occasioning the recent withdrawal of the policemen.”
