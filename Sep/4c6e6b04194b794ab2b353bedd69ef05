A 23-year-old student of Lagos State Polytechnic (LASPOTECH) identified simply as Pascal, has been stabbed to death by some suspected assailants at Ikorodu area. Pascal, who was studying Business Administration, went out to receive a phone call, when he was stabbed by the assailants in the neck. Witnesses said the deceased was eating in his apartment on Monday about 9p.m., when he received the phone call and the caller asked him to come outside. “Immediately he got outside an argument ensued between him and the person who called him. Before we knew what was happening, he had been stabbed on the neck,” one of the witnesses said. One of the victim’s friends, who gave his name as Lanre, said when Pascal got outside to receive the phone call, he was attacked by the assailants and the assailants immediately ran away from the scene. He said: “Before we knew what was happening, we saw him on the ground bleeding and calling for help from the residents and his co-students. Initially we were all afraid, believing they were cultists but later moved close to him and tried to rescue him. “Even when he was still bleeding, we took him to the nearby police station to report the matter. Unfortunately, he died at the entrance of the police station. “I still don’t understand why the assailants killed him, because he was an easy going person. I did not see him as a cultist, because of his calmness. He was loved by his colleagues.” When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Bala Elkana, said he was not aware of the incident.
