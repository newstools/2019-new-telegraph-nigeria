Amaraizu said Chinwendu, on that fateful day, allegedly drank substance believed to be Sniper with a view to taking her life before she was promptly rushed to Royal Cross Hospital, Nsukka, where she was being revived.   He said: “A full-scale investigation is on now by the operatives of the Nsukka Division of the Nigeria Police, Enugu State Command to unravel the mystery surrounding the attempted suicide just as information from some sympathisers is pointing towards depression over an age old unresolved issue(s).” The PPRO said the victim was responding to treatment.
