A 35-year man, Ezekiel Odeh, yesterday allegedly committed suicide in Otukpo Local Government Area of Benue State. It was learnt that Odeh, who was from Igbeji Akpa, took a substance known as “goodbye” believed to be a poisonous herb. A source in the community said Odey had earlier threatened to take his life but was prevented by family members.  “He had been threatening to kill himself before now. He took the substance yesterday morning and locked himself in the room where he died,” the source said. The source described Odeh as “a gentle and easy-going man who was connected to most politicians in the state”.   Odeh did not leave any suicide note to give any reason for his action. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Catherine Anene, said she was not aware of the incident.
