A number of protesters under the aegis of Lagos Youth Vanguard (LYV) on Tuesday stormed the Lagos State House of Assembly to demand the probe of former governor Akinwunmi Ambode over alleged corrupt activities. The protesters, who chanted solidarity songs, were led by the Patron of LYV, Mr. Rasak Olokooba and the President of the Group, Mr. Ibrahim Ekundina. Some of the placards the protesters were carrying read: “Ambode, submit yourself for probe,” “Ambode must be probed,” “EFCC do your job,” and “Ambode, return Lagos money.” The Lagos Youth Vanguard stated in their leaflets that were distributed to journalists that Ambode “deliberately laid landmine through the obvious improper, inappropriate and insufficient content in his handover note that should serve as a guide to the incoming administration in the tradition of every civilised public officer.” They accused Ambode of flouting many government procedures, saying that he refused to abide by the procurement laws. He was accused of wrong priority in policies and programmes and abandoning the track that can bring about development in the state. “We call for his probe and investigation with a view to apportioning penalty and dishing out appropriate penalties,” they said.
