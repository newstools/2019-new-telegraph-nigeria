Ten persons were on Sunday killed in Ukwuagba, Ngbo, Ohaukwu Local  Government Area of Ebonyi State.  This is coming after four persons went missing on Saturday while on their way to a burial in Effium community in the local government.  Ukwuagba, Umuoguduakpu and Umuogudu Oshia in the local government have  been under heavy attacks by suspected warlords from neighbouring Agila  in Ardo Local Government Area of neighbouring Benue State following a protracted boundary tussle.  It is, however, not clear whether the recent killings and disappearance of the four persons were carried out by the warlords.
