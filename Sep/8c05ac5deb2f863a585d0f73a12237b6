The Social Democratic Party (SDP) has told the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) that it cannot disqualify its candidate from participating in the November 16 governorship in Kogi State. The party’s governorship flag bearer, Mrs Natasha Hadiza Akpoti, who led party supporters on a demonstration at INEC headquarters on Tuesday, accused the commission of frustrating SDP’s attempt to substitute her running mate. This was coming less than 24 hours after the governorship candidate of the Allies Peoples’ Movement (APM), Yusuf Mamman, made a similar allegation against INEC. SDP had sought to substitute Muhammad Bashiru Yakubu with Engr. Khalid Adam as Akpoti’s running mate because of age. Yakubu is 34 years, which is below the constitutional requirement age of 35. A source said INEC refused to allow the substitution, which was within the period allowed by the Electoral Act.
