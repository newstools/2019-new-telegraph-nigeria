•Police: We can’t verify   As controversies continued to trail the emergence of transport unions’ leadership in Lagos, a chieftain of National Union of Road and Transport Workers (NURTW) Lagos State branch, Mr Mustapha Adekunle, yesterday debunked claims he was on wanted list in connection with the crisis among the union. Saturday Telegraph gathered that there had been cold war among the various transportation unions, especially NURTW and the Road Transport Employer Association (RTEAN) in the state over leadership tussle.   Over 200 members of the RTEAN on Thursday stormed the Lagos State Secretariat, Alausa, to protest the allegation of imposition of the state chairman on them by the state government and the national body of the union. But speaking on the recent All Progressives Congress rally crisis, Adekunle described rumour of his alleged involvement as fallacious news orchestrated by his enemies within the union to blackmail him.   He said the rumour was an attempt to drag his name in the mud with a view to working against his recent appointment by the national body of the union as a member of the caretaker committee of the union in Lagos. He said he was also targeted by the attackers in the crisis that left an NURTW chieftain stabbed. “The news that I am wanted by the police is fallacious and misleading. First, let me clear here that, I am not on the wanted list of the police.  “The issue they were referring to was the violence which occurred in one of the APC rallies in which myself and Alhaji MC Oluomo were the targets of the aggressors.” Meanwhile, speaking with Saturday Telegraph on his claim, the Lagos Police Public Reations Officer, Bala Elkana, said he was not aware whether the chieftain was declared wanted or not. “When was that? I don’t know if he was declared wanted. I’m not sure. I can’t say,” the PPRO said.
