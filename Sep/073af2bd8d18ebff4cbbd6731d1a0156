The youth wing of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that it is expecting 40 per cent of appointments into board of agencies and parastatals of Federal Government. The members, who met at the national headquarters of APC in Abuja yesterday, decried the marginalisation of youths in the composition of the Federal Executive Council (FEC). Addressing the media after their meeting, APC National Youth Leader, Hon. Sadiq Abubakar, said they have communicated with the Presidency and the national leadership of the party on the marginalization of the youth. According to him, they expect the Presidency and the party to right the wrong of ministerial appointments. He said: “We are just coming out of the familiarisation and appreciation meeting with our support groups that really helped us during the 2019 elections. “Basically what was discussed is to show appreciation and to see how we can steer the affairs of the youth in the country and how policies should be made to protect the youth and getting us involved in governance. “Some have discussed about their plights and what should be offered to the youth as their contribution as a party and their support groups.” Asked to speak about the appointments of youths in the present government, he said: “Basically, the appointment of the youth in governance is poor. There has been a communication between us, the party and the presidency. We are expecting appointments for heads of parastatals and agencies. “The executive – the ministers – as constituted, we haven’t found much of our own representation there, as a party, from the youth wing but we have communicated. I think something is going to come handy for us.” Asked what percentage of appointments the youth wing is expecting, he said, “40 per cent.”
