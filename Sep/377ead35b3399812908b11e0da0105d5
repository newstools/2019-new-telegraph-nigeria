       Indigenes of Ebonyi State under the umbrella of Ebonyi State Indigenes in the Diaspora (OESID) have kicked against plans by the state governor, Engr. Dave Umahi to embark on construction of an international airport in the state, stating that it as a white elephant project that would be difficult to achieve at the moment. However, the group has charged him to prioritise projects that will have direct impacts on the people and not the one with ulterior motives. In a statement signed by the spokesman of the group, Ambassador Paschal Ogbonna in Abuja, the group said while the estimated value of the project has not been made public, “it is trite knowledge that building an international airport usually involves colossal amounts of money which may not be available to the state government at the moment. Chances are, the resources would invariably be borrowed either locally or most likely from Chinese and other international financers. “But even if these funds were available to the Ebonyi State government, the organisation of Ebonyi State Indigenes in the Diaspora insist that spending it to build an international airport is a gross misapplication of resources,” the group said. The statement described the project as “a clout chasing endeavour by the state governor David Umahi, who clearly has other ulterior motives in initiating this project.” According to the group, the governor should concentrate the attention of his administration in pursuing “people oriented projects that will directly impact lives of the citizens of the state rather than embarking on this expensive and needless adventure. The group added that with Enugu International Airport less than an hour away from Abakaliki and similar facilities in Owerri, Calabar and Uyo within reasonable driving distances, the construction of an international airport in Ebonyi is clearly not a viable economic model.
