As part of its mandate to uplift and empower the less privileged in the society, The Gobir Organisation Foundation has inaugurated the Gobir Fund in line with its laid down vision and mission. The Foundation, among other things, is to alleviate poverty, which has become endemic and a major issue of concern, not only in Kwara State, but also nationally. In particular, it is to empower the women folk, recognised as the most vulnerable in the society today. The Foundation, which was launched amid pomp and pageantry at the Gobir Organisation office, GRA Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, would provide easy access to interest free micro loans to indigenes of Asa, Ilorin East, Ilorin West and Ilorin South local government areas to enable them set up their own Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with capital for growth. Speaking at the occasion, the Founder of the Organisation, who is also the Waziri Kasar Hausa, and a Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara State, Yakubu Gobir, noted that the empowerment programme, which would be a continuous exercise, would bring relief and succour to every beneficiary, while urging them not to abuse the privilege given to them, stressing that the money must be invested in businesses, and not on personal wants. According to the former governorship aspirant in Kwara State, the amount disbursed ranged from N10,000 to N50,000 depending on the Organisationâ€™s assessment of the needs of each beneficiary, adding that the Foundation would also give training on basic financial intelligence and entrepreneurship to the beneficiaries to put them on sound economic footing.
