Daredevil armed robbers killed a policeman when they raided a branch of a first generation bank at Ise-Ekiti in Ise Orun Local Government Area of Ekiti State. The bandits, who operated for over 25 minutes, reportedly carted away millions of Naira. The incident occurred about 2pm when the robbers, who were in two vehicles, invaded the town through Ikere Road. They shot sporadically into the air to scare away those within the vicinity of the bank. The robbers shot dead a mobile policeman attached to the bank. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Caleb Ikechukwu, said the robbers attacked the bank with dynamite and gained entry into the banking hall. He said: “I can confirm to you that a bank was robbed at Ise-Ekiti this afternoon (yesterday). “The robbers broke the security door with explosive material, precisely dynamite. “Our men are on their trail and we shall ensure that none of them escapes. “Members of the public should go about their normal duties and be assured that we are ready to protect their lives and property at all times.”
