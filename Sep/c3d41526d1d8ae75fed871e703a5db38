Police in Edo State have arrested four persons in connection with the murder of a woman, her daughter and grandson. The victims were identified as Mrs. Alice Omorogbe (52), Mrs. Blessing Efe (25) and a six-month-old baby boy. The victims were murdered on Thursday last week at their residence at Iguadolor community in Ovia North East Local Government Area. Efe’s two-year-old daughter, Gift Efe, was spared. Gift was found in the apartment where the mutilated bodies three of victims were discovered. Those arrested included Pa Iguma Amasowomwan, the Deputy Odionwere (assistant village head) of the community. Sources said Amasowomwan was picked by operatives of Ogida Divisional Headquarters following allegations of complicity levelled against him by the victims’ family. He was interrogated at the Anti-Cult Unit of the state Police Command Headquarters in Benin. The eldest son of the Odionwere of Iguadolor community, Mr. Enaruna Omorogbe, said the victims were wife and children of his late brother. Omorogbe said the Okaighele (youth leader) of Iguadolor Community, Perrick Egbon, recently threatened to kill his late brother’s wife for reporting him to some elders in the community because he used bulldozer to demolish her uncompleted building. However, Egbon denied the allegations. He appealed to the police and relevant authorities to unravel and prosecute the killers. Egbon said he travelled out of town and did not even know the victims. He said: “All what they are saying are allegations. It is not true that I killed those people. The world will soon know the truth about the incident and I call on the police to investigate the matter.” The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Chidi Nwabuzor, could not be reached for comments.
