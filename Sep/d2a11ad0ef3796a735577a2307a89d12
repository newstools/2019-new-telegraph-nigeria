Chairman, Board of Trustees (BoT) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Wali Jubrin said he would intervene in the controversy sorrounding the alleged demolition of mosque in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.
Rivers State Governor Nyeson Wike and his counterpart, Abdullahi Ganduje have been on a collision course over the matter.
But Jubrin called for dialogue and amicable resolution of the misunderstanding, warning that it could degenerate into crisis between Muslims and Christians and between North and South.
“Whatever the Rivers State governor, Wike has done or did not do over the  alleged demolition of the  mosque and the reactions of Governor Ganduje and former governor Shekarau is too harsh to contemplate going to court.
“We need to follow the path of peace and dialogue to resolve this misunderstanding, knowing that we in Nigeria that road could lead to what we did not bargain for.
“All efforts should be channelled towards a peaceful resolution of this issue through dialogue,” he said.
Jubrin promised to visit Governor Wike and get first hand information on what actually happened.
He argued that even there was such a demolition, the Rivers State government might allocate another land to the Muslim community in Port Harcourt to build a better mosque.
