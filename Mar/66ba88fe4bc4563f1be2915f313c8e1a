Doyen of Nigeria’s aviation, Capt. Dele Ore, yesterday took a cursory look at the aviation sector and returned with a verdict that the sack of 47 Nigeria Airways pilots in one fell swoop by the Federal Government led to the downward spiral of the sector. The sack he said, occurred in December 1988.  Ore, who spoke at the unveiling of his book, “The Learned Commander” said the decision taken by the Federal Government in the defunct national airline was one of his saddest moments in the service. He explained that government policy and bad health of some of the pilots cumulated in the sack of 47 in one day.  Ore also said recalled that he was appointed and sacked as the Chief Pilot in the former national carrier thrice by different governments, saying that inconsistency in policy formulation and execution led to the eventual death of the airline. According to him, the government as a policy then had wanted to reduce the workforce of the airline by 50 per cent, stressing that before the retrenchment, the airline had about 3,700 staff. He maintained that the sack of the pilots was a step in the wrong direction, which had a negative effect on the entire performance of the airline.  Ore, who became a pilot at the age of 21, recalled  that he found it painful that 47 pilots were sacked under his watch in one day, stressing that most of those sacked were already captains who the Federal Government trained for at least nine years. He said the 30-chapter book to be presented at the Nigeria Institute of International Affairs (NIIA) in Lagos encapsulates everything about his life from the cockpit to the court room as a legal practitioner.  Ore, who participated actively in the Nigerian civil war when he was flying the wounded Biafran soldiers, added that his last flight before retiring was “a mutiny,” but he survived it by the grace of God.
