The Senior Pastor of Latter Rain Assembly, Pastor Tunde Bakare, yesterday, expressed his willingness to contest for the presidency after the expiration of President Muhammadu Buhari’s second term. Bakare announced his ambition during an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Saturday in Lagos shortly after casting his vote at the Opebi Grammar School polling unit. “I am going to throw my hand into the fray. I am just waiting for President Buhari to finish his tenure.  We cannot continue this way because we have something to offer this country, and we will by the grace of God,” he said. Bakare, who said that he was desirous of making Nigeria one of the greatest countries of the world, added that he looked forward to a future where every Nigerian vote would count.  He said he would continue to pray for the day when  every Nigerian would come out and make their votes count, urging Nigerians to desist from allowing themselves to be deceived by ‘stomach infrastructure’ when the needed infrastructure in their communities had decayed.  Recall that Bakare was Buhari’s presidential running mate in 2011. He had also at Calgary, Canada, in an interview published on January 3, predicted that he would succeed Buhari as Nigeria’s 16th president or head of state.
