A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Benue State, Mr. Terkula Ati, yesterday dragged the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Emmanuel Jime, to the Federal High Court, Makurdi, over allegation of money laundering and electoral fraud. Also joined in the suit were, Jime’s personal aide, Joseph Manasseh, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) as 2nd, 3rd and 4th respondents respectively.  The applicant, Ati, in an affidavit in support of the motion ex-parte brought pursuant to Order 34 Rule (3) of the Federal High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2009 and under the inherent jurisdiction of the honourable court, was seeking a court order on INEC and EFCC (3rd and 4th respondents) to immediately arrest and prosecute the 1st and 2nd respondents, Jime and Manasseh.
