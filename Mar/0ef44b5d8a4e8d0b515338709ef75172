 Justice Oluremi Oguntoyibo of a Federal High Court in Lagos yesterday remanded four men in prison for allegedly producing and selling adulterated engine oil.
The order was sequel to their arraignment by the Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) on a four-count charge of producing, possessing, dealing and distributing substandard engine oil. They were said to have adulterated 128 drums and 9.45 litres of engine oil.
However, the quartet – Uche Johnson, Olaide Shittu, Kingsley Meteke and Abdulquadri Olayinka – denied the alleged offence. After their arraignment, the prosecutor, Mr. J. A. Olofindare, from the Federal Ministry of Justice, sought a trial date to allow the prosecution produce its witnesses to establish its case against the defendants.
Responding, defence lawyer, Mr. S. U. Nweze, informed the court of a bail application filed on behalf of the defendants.
Moving the application, he urged the court to grant them bail on liberal terms. After listening to both parties, Justice Oguntoyibo adjourned further hearing in the matter till March 19, 2019, for ruling on the defendants’ bail application.
She, however, ordered their remand in prison till then. In the charge, SON alleged that the defendants indulged in production of engine oil which did not meet mandatory industrial standards.
The agency said the products, which failed to comply with SON’s Conformity Assessment Programme, were not good for public consumption.
The prosecution said the offence contravened the provisions of Sections 1(8) and 1(8)(II) of the Miscellaneous Offences Act, 2004.
