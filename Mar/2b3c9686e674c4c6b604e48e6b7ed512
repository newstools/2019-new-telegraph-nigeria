For allegedly defiling a 14-year-old girl, a 30-year-old trader, Onyekachi Peter, was on Monday arraigned in an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court. The defendant, a resident of Oworosoki, Lagos, was docked on a count charge bordering on defilement. The prosecutor, ASP Ezekiel Ayorinde, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on Feb. 3 at his residence. He alleged that the defendant unlawfully had carnal knowledge of a 14-year-old girl. The prosecutor said: “The father of the girl saw a love letter inside his daughter’s school bag, he read it and questioned her. “She confessed to her father that the defendant had slept with her on many occasions. “When the father wanted to beat her, the girl ran to the defendant’s apartment and passed the night there, and had sex again with her. “The case was reported and the defendant was arrested,” the prosecutor said. Ayorinde said the offence contravened Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015, which prescribes life imprisonment for any convicted offender. The defendant denied committing the offence. The Magistrate, Mrs B.O. Osunsanmi, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N300, 000, with two sureties in like sum and  adjourned the case until March 25. (NAN)
