Police have arrested a mother, identified simply as Blessing, over the death of her 10-year-old son, Abdulahi, in Ikorodu area of Lagos State. Also arrested was the woman’s father. It was learnt that Blessing and her husband, whose name was given simply as Adisa, are divorced, following allegations of infidelity. Blessin and Abdulahi moved in with the grandfather in Ikorodu after she had separated from her husband. A police source said that a few weeks after Blessing moved out of her husband’s house, the young boy fell sick and died in the process. “Shortly after his death, his grandfather, without informing the father of the boy, ordered that the boy be buried. “Trouble started for the father and daughter when the father of the deceased demanded to see his son. After ignoring him for a while, the mother of the deceased opened up that their son, who was their only child they had while being married, had died. “When the father of the child demanded to see his son, he was told that the child had died. But when he requested for the corpse, they told him it had been buried in a cemetery. “The boy’s father immediately reported the matter to the police. When the police asked the grandfather to take the operatives to the spot where the boy was buried at the cemetery, he could not do so. This prompted their arrest,” the source said. When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Bala Elkana, promised to get back to our correspondent. He was yet to do that at press time.
