 Before this pregnancy, Nessa had four miscarriages, which came in quick successions. After the last miscarriage five years ago, she went from one pastor to another for prayers. She spent a fortune on many merchants of prayers. One day, she went to see a man of the gods who told her to hand her car keys to him if she wanted her prayers to be answered. Desperate Nessa would have done just that, but the car belonged to a colleague in the office. The car she drove to work that day stalled as she was about to drive out during lunch time. Her colleague, who gave her the contact of the Pastor, told her she could use her car since the place she was going was close by. When she told the Pastor the car wasn’t his, he got angry and used some inappropriate words. Nessa was shocked. She stood up and left quietly. That was the last time she visited prayer vendors. Each time she remembered that incident, she would smile. The funny thing <img class="size-medium wp-image-200122 alignleft" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sweet-smelling-evil-5.png?resize=300%2C162&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="162" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sweet-smelling-evil-5.png?resize=300%2C162&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sweet-smelling-evil-5.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1">was that when she returned to the office less than half twenty minutes later and went to check her car, it had no issue again. She realised it was a sign from above. That was the day she stopped prostituting from one church to the other, paying for miracle which didn’t happen. She went back to her church and resumed her prayer and fasting with her Pastor and fellow members. She sighed, yawned and smiled again as she recalled her journey with prayer merchants.  Nessa was lucky she had an understanding mother in-law. In fact, the Adeobas were very accommodating people. Nessa’s pain was their pain. Tume’s two sisters were like blood sisters to her. When she lost her parents within a space of seven years, they were there for her. She was eternally grateful to God for giving her such a loving family. Her only need was a child she and her husband would call their own. Now her prayers had been answered. “I only need to take things easy. Keeping away from adult game is so easy. If that’s all that is needed to have this baby, my darling husband will do it. “Oh I’m so lucky to have such an understanding man as a husband. What would I have done if Tume didn’t love me so much? I’m definitely one of the luckiest women alive,” she reassured herself. Tume glanced at Nessa and observed her lips moving silently. “Any problem?” he asked. “No, I’m just wondering why God blessed me with such a faithful husband like you. Am so lucky,” she replied. Tume winced inwardly but allowed what looked like a smile to flicker across his face. “Dammit! Dammit! Why is this woman causing me this pain? How does she expect me to keep this 11th commandment? I want to, the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.” “A penny for your thoughts, Tume love,” Nessa said. “Yeah darling. My thoughts are six months from now. We have to do everything right,” he said. “We ought to abide by every rule the doctor gives us as long as it will make us have our long awaited bundle of joy. It’s not been easy staying for nine years without a child, you know,” he added. “You’re right, honey,” she agreed. Tume groaned despite the smile plastered on his face. “How am I going to cope? Six months without action? Oh my! What did I do wrong?” As he pondered on the whole thing, blood rushed down his groin. He smiled and muttered, “I am a man, that’s what it means”. Nessa had been a very loving wife. For the nine years they’d been living as husband and wife, she had made sure that she met his every need. Chief among his needs was sex. The fact that her husband didn’t seem to mind the embargo placed on sex was somehow unsettling. Tume had a voracious appetite for adult fun. He had a reputation for it. She had wondered why his childhood friends called him Big Tee. His 5”8 chiselled physical stature and fine face wouldn’t have earned him that alias. But when she got intimate with him, she didn’t need to ask why his friends gave him that moniker. That name fit like a second skin. She recalled the numerous battles she fought to keep other girls away. Tume was a ladies’ man…yes, until their childlessness became a source of concern to them. Give it to him however, he wasn’t going after them, something about him attracted the women to him like a newborn to the mother’s breasts. She had to ward off the girls by making sure she was available whenever he needed her, which was almost every time. Keeping up with Tume’s sexual demand was an issue at a point during their courtship. She thought he would relent after their wedding. Alas, he didn’t! The day she asked him why his libido was so high, his response shocked her. “Have you noticed that old men are at more risk of suffering prostate cancer? It is because of decline in sexual activities,” he had said. She didn’t confirm from a doctor and never talked about it again. She recalled the day her boss caught her sleeping in the office, she was embarrassed. “Mrs. Adeoba, didn’t you sleep at home? You should go back home if you are not ready to work today,” Madam Vicky Ifeadi told her. She had apologised quickly and went back to work. At lunch time that day, she sat in the office and took a nap. That rest was definitely more important to her that day than the lunch. After that incident, she made her lunch break her ‘nap’ time.  One day, she was flipping through the pages of a magazine at home when she saw a story that caught her fancy. In the story, a woman told her husband, “Dear, I’m so tired, I’m going to bed. I’ll leave the door open. Please, ensure you close the ‘door’ with the quilt once you are through. You know the kids may just wake up and come into our bedroom. I don’t want them to chance upon what will give them convulsion…” Nessa could not help laughing. In fact, she laughed until tears streamed down her cheeks when the import of the woman’s words hit her. That was another woman’s way of handling a man with high libido. Of course, she couldn’t solve her problem that way. For Tume, mating was a two-way thing and the participants must be actively involved. But it made her realise that her problem was not rare. She shook her head and smiled. That story elicited laughter whenever she remembered it. But today, she smiled and glanced at her husband and wondered why he was so unperturbed about the embargo on sex. Tume once told her, “Sex is like a meal to me. I can take it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Unlike food, it’s the best way to my heart.” Now that he would have to keep off it for a long time, how would he cope? Nessa suddenly realised that she had an emergency on her hands. She needed to talk to someone. She picked up her IPhone and pinged her best friend, Tami. “Babe, how’re you doing? We need to see. It’s urgent. Can you pass by after work tomorrow? Plenty gist.” She sent the message and waited. Few minutes later, the reply came, “Babes, what happened? Hope I’m safe? Will see you tomorrow, keep my usual. How’s hubby? My love to him and that angel in your womb.” Nessa smiled. So like Tami. Always looking out for her. She glanced at her husband’s direction and almost froze. His eyes were trained on the television but between his lap was a turgid, huge man pushing against the slack he was wearing. That very moment, Tume turned to look at her and she quickly closed her eyes and pretended to have fallen asleep. She was lying on the ottoman so it was easy to assume she had drifted off to sleep.  Tume stared at her reclining figure for a while. When he was convinced that she had fallen asleep, he pulled down his slack and freed his imprisoned man and started stroking it. He relaxed on the couch, closed his eyes, and played with his monster which size seemed to be increasing as he worked on it. Of course, Nessa had opened her eyes a bit and was watching him. This was another Tume she was seeing. Of course, this was the first time she would see his monster at turgid mode at a close distance and not be directly responsible for its anxious state. She watched, entranced, as her husband played with his monster expertly. Tume was obviously adept at handling a male tool. Where did he learn that? He was better than her in that department! It meant he had been doing that for a long time. It occurred to her that only a gay could be that good on that tool. She cursed herself for letting such thought cross her mind. Tume that love supple flesh and was so addicted to it! She suddenly felt mushy. Her honeypot was getting creamy and twitchy. She felt warm all over. As she watched her husband’s every move, soft moans built up in her throat. Her tits became taunt and she started squeezing her butt…  •Send your observations to:
