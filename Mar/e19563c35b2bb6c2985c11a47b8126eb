A group, Re-elect Buhari Movement (RBM), which is one of the support groups that rallied support for President Muhammadu Buhari’s re-election has thanked Nigerians for voting massively for the President’s re-election, even as it has formally ended its operations. The group in a statement by its convener, Mr. Emmanuel Umohinyang, noted that Buhari was on a mission to re-invent the country and therefore solicited Nigerians support for his second term. The statement reads: “Sequel to the re-sounding victory of President Muhammadu Buhari in the February 23, 2019 Presidential election, the existence of Re-Elect Buhari Movement (RBM); one of the support groups that volunteered to work for the re-election of the President has officially come to a close. “It has become expedient to dissolve membership of the Re-Elect Buhari Movement as currently constituted since the main objective of founding the Movement has come to a successful end. “It is no longer feasible to keep volunteers of the Movement as a functioning group in the face of the present reality, hence the need to formally dissolve same. “On behalf of President Buhari, I therefore extend a warm appreciation to every member of the Movement and wish them well in their various future endeavors. “I enjoin them to always count themselves as members of the progressive team that worked for the victory of President Buhari who is on mission to rebuild the country ravaged over the years by corrupt leadership that thrived much on primitive accumulation of wealth. It would be recalled that about a year ago, the Re- Elect Buhari Movement was founded as a volunteer support group.
