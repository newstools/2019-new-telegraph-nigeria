Leicester City of England attacker, Kelechi Iheanacho is facing the axe at the former English Premier League champions, as their new coach, Brendan Rodgers is talking seriously about launching a ‘summer revolution’ on new players. Footballlive.ng reports that the arrival of new players at King Power Stadium would mean Iheanacho dropping further down The Foxes’ perking order, which could ultimately lead to his exit from the squad. That being the case, the lad, who joined Leicester from Manchester City, could become part of the clear-out in the sweeping changes Rodgers wants to bring in, as the former Liverpool and Celtic of Scotland boss says he just has to be very busy in the summer transfer window. Iheanacho’s new coach added that he was confident of getting a bumper summer transfer budget from the club’s top brass, as he needs more cash to strengthen the squad ahead of next season. Claude Puel’s successor added that he got the promise of more cash after staying talks with the new chairman, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha and director of football Jon Rudkin.  ‘Top’ has assumed control after the tragic death of his father, Vichai in a helicopter crash, and Rodgers says he does not intend to disappoint the man that hired him in place of sacked Puel. Rodgers disclosed: “All Top gave me was support. For the first time in his life he is without his father, he made this decision without his father. “He’s been courageous and brave throughout the process, that was clear to see. We will work to give supporters a team they van be proud of.”  “There is no doubt we will look to improve, but there is no figure, no number. Each year you have to improve, I’m sure we will spend.”
