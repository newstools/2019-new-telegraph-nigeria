The United States (U.S.) has called on election stakeholders, including the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies in the country to allow the will of Nigerians to prevail in Saturday’s supplementary elections. In a statement yesterday by the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria, the American government promised to follow closely the on-going elections in the country. “The United States supports a democratic process where the will of the Nigerian people is reflected in the results. We do not have a preferred party or candidate,” the statement said. It expressed disappointment at low voter turnout as well as reports of voter intimidation, vote buying, interference by security forces, and violence in some locations in the previous elections, as noted by many observer groups in their preliminary reports. “We are saddened by those acts of violence and extend our deepest sympathy to the families of those who lost their lives, including those who worked for INEC and the security services. “As the 2019 electoral cycle comes to an end, we urge all stakeholders to work towards a free, fair, credible, transparent, and peaceful process, especially for the many Nigerians across the country who again will go to polls on Saturday. “We encourage all stakeholders, including INEC, political parties, and the security services, to continue to improve the electoral process for future elections. “We look to Nigeria as an important leader on the African continent. “As a democratic partner of Nigeria, the United States remains committed to working together to achieve our mutual goals of peace and prosperity for the citizens of both our countries,” the statement added.
