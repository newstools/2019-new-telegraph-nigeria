The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), says it has recovered 20 out of the 69 card readers stolen in Bayelsa during the February 23, President and National Assembly elections. INEC’s Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the state, Mr. Monday Udoh, who disclosed this at a news conference in Yenagoa, however, failed to disclose specifically how the recovered card readers were found. He said: “Actually, the missing card readers are 69, we have recovered 20; only 49 are still missing. “As it is now, the state House of Assembly election of March 9, will not hold in wards and units where we cannot recover the card readers as directed by the commission. “I urge those in possession of the remaining 49 card readers to return them to avoid facing the full wrath of law,” he said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the card readers were stolen in wards and polling units in five Local Governments Areas (LGAs) of the state -Brass, Sagbama, Southern-Ijaw, Nembe and Yenagoa. On today’s elections, Udoh assured that it would be orderly in the interest of the people of Bayelsa and Nigerians at large.
