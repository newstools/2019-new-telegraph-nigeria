The seventh edition of the IAAF Silver Label Okpekpe international 10km road race will be live on television across the globe on Saturday May 25, 2019. Zack Amodu, the race’s director of organisation, told the media on Thursday in Lagos that organisers of the historic event,Pamodzi Sports Marketing, has concluded arrangements with the number one cable TV in Africa for another live broadcast of this year’s race. ”We have sealed an agreement with our broadcast partner Supersport for a live telecast of the event.Supersport has been our broadcast partner since the start of the race in 2013 and what we have just done is to ensure the race goes on live television again,” said Amodu who explained that the decision to go live again was not only to fulfil one of the key requirements of staging an IAAF silver label road race but also to ensure more people across the globe who have hitherto been limited by geographical constraint to watch the race live instead of waiting for a delayed broadcast. ‘Supersport will start running the promo as one of its exciting packages sports lovers and non-sports lovers can look forward to in the month of May. From today, repeat of last year’s historic race will start running on Supersports Blitz up till Wednesday April 17 in the first instance,” Amodu said. Meanwhile,Supersport says they are delighted to be associated with the first race in West Africa to get an IAAF recognition via the bronze label rating in 2015 and the first to also be upgraded to a silver label status just last year.
