The total volume of hydrocarbon production in Nigeria – oil and condensate – has hit 2.2 million barrels daily. The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which yesterday declared this at the 2019 International Petroleum Week Conference in London, also ruled out oil output cut by the country despite 1.68 million barrels quota slammed on the country by Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Group Managing Director of the corporation, Dr. Maikanti Baru, who declared this, maintained that the total production volume is made up of 1.8 million barrels of oil per day, plus around 400,000 bpd of oil categorized as condensates. Part of oil classified as condensate, according to Baru, is the crude produced from the new ultra deep water Egina field. He declared that the country would, notwithstanding the huge output, conform to an OPEC-led production quota. The NNPC boss also called on investors to utilize the over $48 billion investment opportunities available in the upcoming capital projects within Nigeria’s oil and gas industry. Speaking at a Panel Session on a sub-theme “The New Frontier for Africa’s Oil & Gas,” the NNPC GMD said that the continent’s energy outlook was looking positive amid difficult operating and economic headwinds.
