…as Imama’s boys lost 2-0 It was a bad day in the office for the country’s Olympics Eagles as they suffered a 2-0 defeat in the hands of Libya in their first leg of the U-23 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers played in Tunisia on Wednesday. The Libyans started on a high, scoring the opening goal as early as the 6th minute of the game with the second goal coming in the second half. Things got worse for the Olympics Eagles after goalkeeper Abubakar Adamu got sent off towards the end of the first half with the Nigerian side still 1-0 down after he handled the ball outside his area. Despite starting with attacking threat of Taiwo Awoniyi, Samuel Chukwueze and Kelechi Nwakali, the Nigerian side failed to make their superiority count on the field of play. The Olympic Eagles dominated the game from the midfield and had some opportunities to get a goal but fluffed most of the chances. With Nigeria searching for the equaliser, Libya doubled their lead via a sleek counter-attack move, making the second leg a herculean task for the country. The coach Imama Amakapabo-led side must get a three goals victory, while not allowing their opponents a sniff of goal in the second leg to qualify for the next round. The second leg is scheduled for the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba on Monday March 25.
