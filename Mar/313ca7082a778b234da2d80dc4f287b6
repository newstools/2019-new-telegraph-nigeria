The Executive Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta has said that the country’s broadband penetration had increased to 33 per cent as at February 2019. According to a statement from the commission, Danbatta disclosed this while receiving a high powered delegation from Bharti Airtel Group, led by Mandara Raghunath, Chief Executive Officer Airtel Africa, who paid him a courtesy visit in his office in Abuja. He expressed optimism that Nigeria can achieve 70 per cent broadband penetration milestone in the next five years, even though a new national target of the penetration has not been made public yet. “We exceeded expectation of Nigeria as the broadband penetration was 31 per cent as at December last year. The good news is that we are steadily seeing increase in the penetration. As at February, it was almost 33 per cent. “There is a new target, though no official pronouncement has been made, but we are hearing stakeholders saying it is possible to hit 70 per cent in the next five years. When you divide 70 per cent by 5, that will give you an idea of what we are expected to hit on annual basis. “So far, no official pronouncement has been made by the supervising minister who is the custodian of the National Broadband Plan, including the one that has just lapsed.”
