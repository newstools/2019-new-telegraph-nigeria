Enugu Rangers’ coach, Gbenga Ogunbote, has said the club first target will be to finish top three before thinking of winning the Super 6.
The team was recently eliminated from the CAF Confederation Cup and the coach said they have to set another target for themselves.
“The fortunate thing is that we are looking for the first three. After that, we have the Super Six where we will have the true champions,” Ogunbote told npfl.ng.
“When you just come out of a continental tournament, unfortunately losing out having done below your benchmark or whatever your target is, you have to set another target.
“You don’t accept that as a failure. You take it as an experience where you can do better if given another opportunity. The opportunity will not come unless you work for it.
“I know and I understand the Nigerian league very well. If you win all your home matches and you have four points on the road, you get a continental slot. But where this season is going, I think it’s good for our football with the new development.
Rangers’ next game will be away to Niger Tornadoes after securing four points against Remo Stars in their last two matches.
