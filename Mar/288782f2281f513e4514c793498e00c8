…as protest rocks Abia over result  Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia state yesterday thanked Abians for a renewed confidence and mandate given him for another term of four years, assuring that his administration would witness greater development in all fronts. Briefing the press on his victory at the Government House shortly after being declared winner of the governorship polls by the INEC, Ikpeazu said that his government would mainstream women and youths with a view to run an inclusive government. According to him, various developmental projects lined up by his administration including the Enyimba economic city which would create about 700,000 jobs, Osisioma flyover among others would become a reality. He, however, congratulated INEC for a job well done and thanked Abia youths for maintaining peace and ensuring that the election was done in an atmosphere devoid of rancour and blood- letting. He said: “To them, I say it is not a loss in absolute sense of the word but it is a call for duty on a higher pedestal for those who indeed love Abia beyond their personal ambition to rise to the occasion and join hands with this government to deliver the best in terms of democracy dividends.” Meanwhile, protests yesterday trailed the declaration of the governorship election results in the state. The result declared in Umunneochi local government in which APC was credited with 5 votes sparked the first protest by party agents following which there was a break after the the figure was corrected. IPAC chairman, who is also chairman of APGA, Rev Augustine Ehiemere, called for the cancellation of the entire result at the collation center in INEC state office. He alleged that the result of the election was manipulated by the ruling PDP.
