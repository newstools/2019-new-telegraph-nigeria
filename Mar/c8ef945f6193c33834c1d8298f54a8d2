Management of the Federal University of Technology, Minna, has expelled about 41 students of the institution for various offences. Out of the affected students, 12 are y in 500 level, two in 400 level, 11 in 300 level, seven in 200 level and nine in 100 level. In a statement published in its bulletin, the institution said the action was the outcome of the 440th Senate meeting which met on Wednesday February 27, this year. The statement reads in part: “Senate, at its meeting, considered and approved the withdrawal of the students from the university. “The reason for their withdrawal is due to overstaying and voluntary withdrawal.” When contacted, the Head of Information Department, Mrs. Lydia Legbo, confirmed the story. She said: “The students concerned have outlived their usefulness in the university. That was what resulted in the school asking them to leave. “The step was taken to sanitise the institution and make the students more alive to their responsibilities. “In the last academic session, over 65 students were directed to withdraw for various reasons including poor academic performance.” The Vice Chancellor, Prof Abdullahi Bala, at the last convocation, had challenged the students to focus more on their studies as the management would not tolerate indolence and nonchalant attitude.
