Worried by the challenges facing the standard of education in the country, the deputy governorship candidate on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, has called for decentralisation of the education system.  This, he said had become imperative as the centralization of the system often delayed provision of teaching materials and carrying out renovation works in schools, with its attendant problem of holding back the students from learning effectively.  Speaking during an interactive session with Lagos State chapter of the University of Ibadan (UI) alumni in Lagos, Hamzat assured them that their administration when elected, would introduce policies that would improve education and all other sectors of the economy in the state.  Hamzat, the running mate of Babajide Sanwo-Olu in the March 9, governorship and House of Assembly election, hinted that Sanwo-Olu/ Hamzatâ€™s administration would introduce policies to fast-track activities in the school system.
