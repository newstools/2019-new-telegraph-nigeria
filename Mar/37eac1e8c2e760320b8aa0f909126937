Head Coach of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Football Club, Fidelis Illechukwu, has expressed surprise at his team’s performance so far in the 2018/19 NPFL abridged season, AOIFootball. com reports. The Olukoya Boys are currently top of Group A despite allowing the bulk of last season’s players to leave for greener pastures. Ilechukwu said: “So many things have happened but hard work pays because I am quite surprised at the way the boys picked up despite the fact that they are new players”. Onuwa Chukwuka, Sikiru Olatubosun, Stephen Odey are some of the players that left the club since they gained promotion to the Premier League. The Agege Landlords have however risen to the occasion this term and have 18 points from their opening 8 games, winning six and drawing two of those matches.
