There is a notion that there is no permanent friend or permanent enemy in politics, but permanent interest. This notion seem to be playing out across the country as foes are now becoming friends and friends becoming foes after the 2019 general elections. Politricks gathered that in many states, opponents and political gladiators, who worked against the interest of some candidates during the March 9 election, are now singing the praises of the winners. Some have started positioning themselves ahead of the May 29 inauguration. In fact, in the last few days, some Governors-elect have extended hands of fellowship to their co-contestants in the “interest” of their respective state. In Ogun and Oyo states for example, Dapo Abiodun and Seyi Makinde, have visited and received leaders and stakeholders within and outside their states, including those for and against their governorship ambition.
