Twenty-two passengers – three policemen and 19 members of Koko community in Warri North local Government Area of Delta State –escaped death by a whisker when the boat conveying them capsized. The passengers were returning from Ward 3, Ebrohimi, to Koko Jetty after the elections about 1a.m. when their boat capsized on the waterway at Ureju community. Swimmers in coastal community had to dive into the deep sea in search of the passengers. Initially, the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members who were on election assignment were said to be involved in the accident. But it was later disclosed they were not involved. The state acting Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Chuks Orisewezie, said in Asaba yesterday that the report available to the command revealed that four persons were still missing. He said: “Eighteen passengers, three policemen and 15 natives, have been successfully rescued, while four passengers are still missing. Two of the rescued passengers have been rushed to the Oghara General Hospital. No Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) official or NYSC member was involved in the boat mishap as earlier rumoured. The search for the missing passengers is still in progress.” The state Commissioner of Police, Adeyinka Adeleke, reiterated his commitment to ensure the safety and security of lives and property across the state at all times.
