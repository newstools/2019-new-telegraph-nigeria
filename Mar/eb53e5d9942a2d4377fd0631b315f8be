President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, met with seven governors on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Three of the governors are among those who have secured re-election for another four-year term, while two have been elected as senators for the next National Assembly. The governors at the meeting that held at the residence of President Buhari were Yahaya Bello of Kogi, Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna, Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi, Abdulaziz Yari of Zamfara, Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa, Kashim Shetima of Borno and Fayemi Kayode of Ekiti.
The President arrived the Presidential Villa at about 1p.m. yesterday after spending five days in his hometown, Daura, where he travelled to participate in the governorship and state assembly elections held on Saturday. Although the agenda of the meeting, which ended at about 5p.m., was not officially disclosed, it is coming barely 24 hours after the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared six governorship elections in some states of the federation inconclusive.
The affected states are Benue, Plateau, Adamawa, Benue, Sokoto, and Kano while that of Rivers State was declared suspended by INEC. None of the governors spoke to reporters after the meeting with the President. While they arrived the State House through the normal entrance to the Presidentâ€™s office, they all left from his official residence.
INEC, as prescribed by the Electoral Act 2010, is expected to reschedule elections in the affected areas within 21 days from the date of the announcement.
