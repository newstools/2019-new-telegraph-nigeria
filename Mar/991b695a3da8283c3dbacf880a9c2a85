Actress, model and media personality, Amanda Ebeye, ventured into Nollywood over ten years ago. In 2009, she rose to fame after acting in the popular television series, ‘Clinic Matters’ and has featured in over a hundred movies since then. She recently went into movie production where she’s featuring big names in the industry including Bob Manuel Udokwu and Grace Amah. The mother of one, who gave birth out of wedlock, in this interview with ABIOLA ALABA PETERS, shares challenges that comes with making a film in Nigeria and her desire to adopt children  Let’s talk about your new flick, why did you decide to go into production? I told myself, I don’t just want to be an actress because no matter how you act, you can’t be richer than your producer. So, I went back to rethink. So, I am now I’m an actress, producer and filmmaker.  Why the funny title, ‘It’s a Crazy World’? I decided to go with the name because of the content of what I’m shooting. It’s a comedy series. It has lots of competition for women. It has lots of struggles. It’s funny and at same time so much to learn from; touching every aspects of life. At first, I wanted to call it ‘The Wives’, when I created the story but there are lots of movies with similar names out there. I wrote the script but I have writers who write for me. However, there are still some episodes I wrote.  So what exactly is the message in the story? We are tackling issue that has to do with the social media. We are trying to make people see the vices of social media. It’s unarguable that it has made people rich; it has changed the lives of some people. It has connected the world together. But then, there are other bad <img class="size-medium wp-image-196849 alignleft" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Amanda-Ebeye-300x154.png?resize=300%2C154&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="154" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Amanda-Ebeye.png?resize=300%2C154&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Amanda-Ebeye.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1">sides of social media. It has destroyed a lot of people that don’t know how to use it. People get intimidated and depressed over the fine photos they see on social media. So ‘It’s a Crazy World’ has been put on the screen for you to see what happens on social media, behind those lovely, smiling photos.  Seeing all these big faces on your set, must have cost you a whole lot to bring them together; how did you do it? It was Okay. We thank God for Instagram. Most of them, I sent them Direct Messages (DM) and they responded. I got their contacts, chatted them up. Bob-Manuel was the only person I couldn’t get on Instagram because he is not on Social media. So, I got his contact, called him up, spoke with him and he came on board. He didn’t give me any stress.  How did you pick your cast and why Bob-Manuel Udokwu? I developed the treatment in 2017 when I was in film school in Canada. I just want people that command respect in the industry to be in my movie. Over there I thought to myself, who could pull off the role of Don in the movie and I know it would be Bob-Manuel Udokwu. Because he is very good at what he does. He is one of my best actors. When it was time to look for the wives, I know Grace Ama would always play the Kemi role well. Then other ones I picked also fit into their roles perfectly.  How has the chemistry been on set, it’s obviously going to be a long shoot? It has been amazing. Talking about working with these professionals; it has been brilliant. Because they just know what to do. For them, acting is just inborn. They take their lines so smoothly because they have been in the game for so long. They put themselves into the character and deliver perfectly.  Being your first production, what do you think are the challenges? The challenge is budgeting. The light situation, we are shooting for 30 days. When I went to make inquiries to rent cameras and lights, the amount I was told was so shocking. I had to start buying my own equipment to add to the ones I already had. Then feeding all the cast and crew for that number of days, it is not an easy one. They are my responsibility till the shoot is done.  What would you say is the proudest thing you have done for yourself? That will be my son. That’s the greatest thing that has ever happened to me in my life. That’s the only thing I can’t regret. The only person I can’t trade for anything in the world. I can trade this production if the worse comes to worst but my son, never!  How do you create time for him? My son is not here. My mom went to Canada to stay with him. So, my family is always there to support me.  What is that one thing you can’t wait to tell him when he grows up? I tell him I love him every day. But on a deeper level, I can’t wait to tell him that no matter what he does, he would get married someday but he should always have a place in his heart for me. I pray every day that my daughter’s in-law would be good to me. I just don’t want anyone to turn my son away from me.  Any plans to have more kids? I’m not a regular everyday girl. My dreams and aspirations are different. What other women might be dreaming about is not same thing I would want to become. When it comes to giving birth, I really don’t think I want all my children to come from me. I would wait to see what happens in the nearest future. I want to adopt. Right from when I was much younger, I dreamed of the day I’d be able to say this; that I want to adopt kids. I look at those kids that don’t have parents and I keep wondering why we have to keep giving birth when there are already lots of kids out there to take care of. Adoption is my priority than giving birth to my biological children.  Do you have regrets, looking back at some roles you had played in the beginning of your career? There are lots of them I can count. Then when everyone wants to be popular and pay bills, you just pick up any role given to you. That’s why I tell people don’t let this industry pressurise you to do what you don’t want to do. There have been movies that I had done in the past but if you bring the scripts to me now, I’ll turn them down out rightly.
