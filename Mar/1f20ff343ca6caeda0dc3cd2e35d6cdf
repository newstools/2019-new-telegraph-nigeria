There was a mild drama at the Yola High Court yesterday as the governorship candidate of the Movement for the Restoration and Defense of Democracy (MRDD), Mr. Eric Theman, took refuge in the courtroom for over three hours after the court session to avoid a mob action. The gubernatorial candidate, who narrowly escaped being lynched by irate youths at the premises of Yola High Court, accused him of causing the delay in the rescheduled supplementary elections in the state. He was in court to witness the hearing of the case. Theman was also accused of colluding with other key political holders especially the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), which had earlier secured a court injunction restraining INEC from going ahead with the supplementary governorship election slated for this Saturday. Our Correspondent, who was in the court, report that unknown to the MRDD candidate, PDP sympathizers and other stakeholders who were in the court upon hearing of his presence regrouped to lynch him at the end of the court session. The guber candidate, however got wind of the plot and took refuge inside the courtroom, refusing to come out of the court at the end of the court sitting even after the case was adjourned and people have dispersed. According to the PDP sympathizers, the MRDD candidateâ€™s decision to run to court to stop the process was influenced by Governor Mohammed Jibrilla who they believe is using him and his party on the ground that MRDD logo was omitted in the ballot papers in the March 9 election. Meanwhile, the supplementary election scheduled for this Saturday has been put on hold subject to the ruling of the case on the 26th March 2019.
