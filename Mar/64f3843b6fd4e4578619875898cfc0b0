The Police on Tuesday arraigned a 37-year-old businessman, Henry Orlando, in a Karu Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, for allegedly duping his business partner of N3.3 million. The defendant, who resides at Karu, Abuja, is facing charges bordering on criminal breach of trust, cheating, criminal misappropriation, disobedience to an order from public servant and threat to life. He, however, denied committing the offences. The prosecutor, Vincent Osuji, told the court that the complainant, Mrs Scholarstica Ousman of Lagos State, reported the incident at the Karu Police Station on Dec. 8. Donald said that the complainant had alleged that the defendant breached the agreement between them and cheated her. “The complainant alleged that she entrusted some clothes valued at N3.3million to the defendant with an agreement that he will pay her the whole amount after receiving the goods. “But with intent of cheating the complainant, after receiving the goods, the defendant failed to pay as agreed. “Instead, the defendant deliberately refused to answer the complainant’s phone calls which prompted her to travel down to Abuja in order to collect her goods. “ On arriving Abuja, the complainant discovered that the defendant had sold goods worthN355,300 and criminally converted the money into his own personal use,” Osuji said. Osuji added that during police investigation, the defendant was released on administrative bail with an instruction to report back to police station which he failed, instead threatened the police officer. The offences contravened Sections 312, 322, 309, 136 and 153 of the Penal Code. The judge, Sani Mohammed, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N300,000, with one surety in like sum and adjourned the case until March 29 for continuation of hearing (NAN)
