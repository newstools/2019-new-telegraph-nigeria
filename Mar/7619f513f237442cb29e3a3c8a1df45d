Head Coach of Nigeria’s senior basketball team, D’Tigers, Alex Nwora, has disclosed that home-based players are not in his plan for the World Cup finals later in the year in China.
Nigeria qualified for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup with a record of 9-0, and as the first country to punch a ticket for the 18th edition of the competition. Nwora told the official page of the Nigeria Basketball Federation he had returned to the drawing board and hinted the coaches would scout the US and also recall the best players from the qualifying windows for a trial camp. Although two domestic league players, Ibe Abuchi Agu (Civil Defenders) and Buchi Nwaiwu (Rivers Hoopers) were drafted as late replacements, the final window was pretty much disappointing. D’Tigers only managed a win in Ivory Coast and finished the campaign 10-2, and the coach insists only the best will make the final cut. He said: “I have to go back to the drawing board; you’ve got to go with your best players because the World Cup is not the type of competition you execute with just any player.
“We’ll stage trials, we’ll go through our list, look at each position, see who’ll be best in each position. “There are so many young players in the US and the NBA that we want to integrate into the system. So being in the camp with all those experienced players that played during the qualifying window will give us a good chance to see what we have going to the World Cup and also moving forward in the future.”
