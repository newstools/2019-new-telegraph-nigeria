Police have apprehended 15 people in Delta State for different electoral offences during the Presidential and National Assembly elections last Saturday. Some were nabbed during the crisis which broke out at Otu-Okpu in Ika North East Local Government Area while others were arrested in Delta Central Senatorial District for tormenting trouble. The acting state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Chuks Orisewezie, said in Asaba yesterday that three suspects, Uvwiejitobor Akpevwe, Alfred Joseph and David Ukiri, all from Udu in Udu Local Government Area, would be arraigned before a Chief Magistrate’s Court, Asaba for electoral offences. The suspects were detailed by their local government chairman to escort electoral materials after sorting and sharing at the Delta State Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) during the postponed polls. “Presently, over 25 suspects are in custody for various electoral offences. They will be charged to court in accordance with the law. It is our conviction that their prosecution will serve as deterrent to others,” Orisewezie said. The PPRO also said police arrested a man, Friday Eluro, of Boji Boji Owa, who had more than 20 boys in his compound, who he used for his nefarious activities. He said Eluro and two others were part of those to be charged to court. Orisewezie said their prosecution would serve as deterrent to others who might want to disturb the prevailing national peace.
