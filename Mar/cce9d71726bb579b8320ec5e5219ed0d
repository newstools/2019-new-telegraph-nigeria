Armed men on Sunday night attacked the home of a former Commissioner in Cross River State, Dr. George Abang-Ekpungu, at his, Kakwagom community. Abang-Ekpungu said yesterday in Calabar that the attackers came with guns and other weapons to his house in the community in Boki Local Government Area. He said: “My house was attacked last night. The thugs came in with guns, machetes and other dangerous weapons to my house to kill me. “There were so much gunshots inside my house. My car and other valuables were destroyed and we found over 15 pellets in the morning. “I don’t know where this is coming from. I thank God for the safety of my wife and children. “I want to call on the state Commissioner of Police and other security agencies to move in immediately and investigate this matter because it has been reported.” Abang-Ekpungu, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), said he had not had any political rivalry with anyone or quarrel which could warrant such attack on his home. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Irene Ugbo, confirmed the incident. She said: “The matter has been reported to the police in Boki. It was a malicious damage. There was no injury or loss of life.”
