Wife of the President, Dr. Mrs. Aisha Muhammadu Buhari, has reaffirmed her commitment towards promoting the socio-economic and political advancement of women in Nigeria through her Future Assured Programme.  She spoke at the NEXT LEVEL Thank you Celebration and Luncheon in Lagos on Saturday. Buhari said the President has already promised to engage more women and youths in his second term. She therefore urged them not to relent in the collective duty to make the NEXT LEVEL a reality.  “I wish to express my appreciation to Nigerians especially women and youths for their unprecedented contribution towards our success at the election. In particular, I must mention the role played by the women and youth presidential campaign team I initiated to support the APC Presidential Campaign Council.”  Buhari attributed the success of the President to the firm belief Nigerians have in the ability of “this  administration’s developmental agenda to take us to the NEXT LEVEL.”  She therefore called on the President and Vice President to continue to build on the foundation of the good works they started in order to justify this confidence. Earlier, wife of the vice President, Mrs. Dolapo Osinbajo, in her remarks, said the event was convened to celebrate all those that contributed in one way or the other to the successful re-election of the APC to lead the country for the next four years.
