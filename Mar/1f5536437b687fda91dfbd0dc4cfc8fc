 Nigeria’s hopes of having a High Performance Centre received a big boost during the week when ITF Development Officer for West and Central Africa, Illou Lonfo, agreed that the country ‘deserves and needs’ the facility, promising to include the recommendation in his report to the International Tennis Federation.
Lonfo, who is scheduled to end a one-week visit to Nigeria this weekend, made the comments when the Nigerian Tennis Federation paid a visit to the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC), in Abuja. The NTF team, led by President Dayo Akindoju met with the NOC Chief, Habu Gumel, who expressed delight at having Lonfo in the country, and promised to do everything within his powers to ensure that Nigeria gets the High Performance Centre.
Meanwhile, the International Tennis Federation has approved two weeks of junior tournaments in Nigeria. The Nigeria Tennis Federation had applied for nine weeks so as to deepen the development of the sport in Nigeria, but the global body has granted just two, with the tournaments set to be staged in Abuja in July.
President of the NTF, Dayo Akindoju, earlier disclosed that a key part of the Federation’s plans for 2019 is to concentrate on the development of junior players, which prompted the national body to request for nine weeks of tournaments from the ITF. The world body initially approved only one week, but the NTF wrote back to the ITF restating its request for nine weeks.
