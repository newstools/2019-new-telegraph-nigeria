Non-availability of the required working capital and other operational challenges have impacted the growth of FTN Cocoa Processors Plc., Chris Ugwu writes  Before the massive oil revenues of the 1970s, Nigeria used to be the second biggest country in the production of cocoa in the 1960s. But unfortunately, the over-reliance on oil has inadvertently led to the dwindling fortunes of most Nigerian cocoa farmers, who have had to relinquish their position as Africa’s leaders in the production of the cash-crop to Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana.
Hence, the overconcentration has driven the unwavering devotion given to cocoa to the oblivion and eroded Nigeria’s position as Africa’s leader in production of the crop. According to market watchers, in a comparative analysis with other cocoa exporters, it is clear that Nigeria lacks a policy with the vitality for developing cocoa as a main foreign exchange earner. Ivory Coast, for instance, has a stabilisation fund for cocoa since 1978. The country has well equipped warehouses, a liberalised cocoa market, an aid policy and a centralised body called Consel di CafeCacao, which is responsible for management, regulation, development and price stabilisation. However, with the recent export stimulation facility initiative introduced by the government to drive exports in Nigeria, operators who are currently experiencing intense hardship, argued that no exporter has been able to access the funds for almost one year of its pronouncement. The cocoa industry in Nigeria has remained one of the most neglected sectors of economy despite its position as one of the most viable agro-allied industries in the world due to some militating factors. Among the factors identified by market watchers as setbacks to the sector are high cost of borrowing, deregulated environment, inconsistent government policy and slow implementation of policies. Others include delays in the disbursement of the export expansion grant; imposed duty on processed cocoa in the international market; high interest rates; underutilisation of installed capacities, poor power supply and the lack of competitiveness of processed cocoa when compared with raw cocoa in the export market. FTN Cocoa Processors Plc, a pioneer-status agro allied company has continued to battle with lower sales and negative bottom-line, as harsh operating environment takes toll on the general economy prompting the company to remain at a loss position as regards profits. The firm, which has been facing a threat to its continuity as its bankruptcy issue heightens, has also not held any annual general meeting or declared dividends for the past two years due to the unfavourable condition of the company and non-availability of required working capital. In spite that the share prices on the Nigerian Stock Exchange is currently witnessing positive sentiment, the price of FTN Cocoa has remained stagnated at 20 kobo year-to-date following negative sentiments that have enveloped the demand of the stock.

Status report of the company The board of FTN Cocoa Processors Plc, recently explained reasons for its failure to convene an annual general meeting for two consecutive years, saying this was due unfavourable business condition, which has led the company not to able to declare dividends. In a statement signed by the company secretary, Alpha Genasec Limited, and sent to the NSE, the management said that the non-availability of the required working capital to procure cocoa beans, its major raw materials for production has affected the business negatively. It stated that various efforts being made to secure working capital both locally and international are yet to yield the desired result, adding that one of the company’s foreign partners (Transmar Commodity USA) unfortunately had financial problems and went into liquidation. The company said that this was the major reason why FTN Cocoa virtually ceased operation for over two years. It added that the company has piles of staff salaries, statutory payments, secretary and auditors’ fees with other financial obligations including listing fee that are now outstanding, saying that the situation was further worsened by the recent takeover of the company’s head office by its creditor bank for failure to meet its obligation, forcing FTN Cocoa to relocate to a rented operational office. However, the company assured that all hope is not lost, as management has been scouting for funds to save the firm from total collapse. “In view of the above, management of FTN Cocoa has been scouting for funds to save the company from total collapse,” it said. “The company is glad to notify its stakeholders that some level of progress is being recorded in respect of the expected funding and there is hope that the company will soon come out of the financial problem. The company will keep its investors and other stakeholders posted on future development. The company is hopeful of holding its outstanding AGMs during the current financial year.”  Last line There is a need for the Federal Government to intervene in the sector – just like the textile sector, as FTN Cocoa Processors like any of its peers are faced with various challenges ranging from high interest rates, naira devaluation, underutilisation of installed capacities, poor power supply and the lack of competitiveness of processed cocoa when compared with raw cocoa in the export market.
