State Government House photographer, Reginald Dei, who was allegedly shot by men in army uniform in Oweikorogha, Southern Ijaw Local Government Area of the state during the February 23 Presidential and National Assembly elections, has died. This was as the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) disassociated itself from the electoral violence in Oweikorogha during the election in the state. A statement by the Director, Corporate Communications, Governor’s Office, Chief Nathan Egba-Ologo, said the photographer died in a Yenagoa hospital on Sunday night after days of battling to survive the lethal wounds from the gunshots. Dei was alleged to have been shot with the leader of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Oweikorogha community, Mr. Seidougha Taribi, while the two were waiting for the outcome of the election in their ward at the party chair’s residence. But, the state Publicity Secretary of APC, Mr. Doifie Buokoribo, in a statement, yesterday in Yenagoa, dismissed insinuations by Governor Seriake Dickson and the state PDP that Seidougha Taribi was a victim of violence perpetrated by APC supporters. The APC challenged the picture painted by the Bayelsa State Government, saying nothing could be further from the truth.
