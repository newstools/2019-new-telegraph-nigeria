Governor Kashim Shettima of Borno State has inaugurated a 10-man committee to investigate allegations of child prostitution and forceful abortion in Maiduguri Maximum Prison by an online medium. Inaugurating the committee at the Government House, Maiduguri yesterday, Shettima said “in my position as the chief security officer of the state and as responsible and responsive government, it behoves on us to treat allegations with the seriousness it deserves because this does not only border on the law but the sanctity of those inmates allegedly abused by those who are supposed to protect them”. Shettima said it was alleged that the heinous crime was carried out by those entrusted with their care and welfare which, according to him, is totally unacceptable. He said: “This is potentially a great danger and something needs to be done to put an end to this ugly development. We must punish all those involved, no matter highly placed. “Any person or group of persons who are found wanting will be forced to face the full wrath of the law to serve as deterrent to others.” The committee, which has one week to complete its assignment, has seven terms of reference, which include to identify those involved in the crime, verify the involvement or otherwise of the prison officials and make recommendations to the government. Responding, the state Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Kakashehu Lawan, commended the governor for promptly acting on the allegation. He said: “Thank you for finding us worthy to serve in this committee. We are going to study the terms of reference and we will do justice without fear or favour, affection and ill will. We assured you, we are going to do justice to all.” Lawan said the committee would immediately swing into action and make its recommendations within the stipulated time and terms of reference.
