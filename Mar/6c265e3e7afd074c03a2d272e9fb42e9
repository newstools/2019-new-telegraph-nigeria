The Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) yesterday called on Lagos State Governor-elect, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu to fix deplorable roads scattered in the state with a view to ensuring free flow of traffic and helping to reduce road crashes.
RTEAN Chairman, Lagos Chapter, Alhaji Mohammed Musa, made the appeal while setting agenda for Sanwo-Olu in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. Musa urged Sanwo-Olu to use his office to save lives of the people by fixing bad roads across the state and constructing new ones.
He said: “Many Nigerians die daily due to bad roads that lead to accidents or stress encountered during gridlock. “A journey that should not take up to an hour can take more than six hours, especially on the major roads that are of economic importance to the nation. “Our advice to the newly-elected governor is to look at road infrastructure and improve them, not only for us, but for the good of Lagos residents who suffer a lot on the road.”  “This road is an international road, as it leads to the border between Nigeria and Seme. “RTEAN members worked so hard in campaigns and during elections by making sure that members vote for APC both at the Federal and the State levels. “We want government attention on this corridor and others to alleviate the suffering of motoring public and commuters.”
