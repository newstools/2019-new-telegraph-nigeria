Meanwhile, some youths of Orokere community had earlier on Saturday conducted a peaceful demonstration to the palace of their traditional ruler, to protest against the alleged importation of thugs to their community by suspected opposition party members. The youths alleged that the thugs were imported by some politicians in the area to cause mayhem and disrupt the electoral process. Mr Segun Peter, the youth leader, who spoke on behalf of the youths at the palace, urged the monarch to call the politicians to order so as to forestall a breakdown of law and order during the elections. “The thugs threatened to disrupt the electoral process in the community, and unleash terror on members of opposition parties.“The thugs also threatened that voters, who have decided not to vote for their candidates should not bother to come out to vote. “We are peace-loving people, our youths are ready to stand firm and resist any form of intimidation to protect our votes,” Peter said.
