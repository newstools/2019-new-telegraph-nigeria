Operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), Ikeja, Lagos State Police Command, have arrested two robbery suspects for allegedly dispossessing unsuspecting Nigerians of their valuables.
The state Commissioner of Police, Zubairu Muazu, confirming the arrest of the suspects, said they were apprehended at the Oregun, Ikeja area of the metropolis.
He said: “We received credible information that some suspected armed robbers were sighted operating at Oregun axis. Immediately, a combined team of operatives from Alausa Police Station and SARS were mobilised to the scene of the incident. The suspects, on sighting the operatives, took to their heels. But luck ran out on one of them. He was arrested at the scene. He was immediately searched. One cut-to-size locally-made single-barrelled gun, three unexpended cartridges, a jack knife and some charms were recovered from him.”
According to the commissioner, during interrogation, the suspect introduced himself as Ifeanyi Owo.
“He led policemen to arrest his partner in crime, Idris Pedro. It was also revealed that the suspects were among robbers who had been terrorising Olowora, Alausa, Ogba and environs. The suspects are currently assisting the police with useful information, which will ultimately lead to the arrest of other fleeing members of the gang,” Muazu said.
