Motorists plying Mararaba/ Nyanya expressway have expressed serious frustration following persistent gridlock on the route. Some motorists, who spoke to Inside Abuja, said that the unbearable gridlock, which extended from Nyanaya market to AYA usually began as early as 2: 00pm every day. They decried the situation, lamenting that the gridlock has become a recurrent problem on the road, with several concomitant discomforts on the commuters. They said that the difficulties faced by motorists on a daily basis on the road called for urgent attention by government in view of the large number of people residing in the area. While attributing the present situation to ongoing construction of pedestrian bridge at Kugbo area of the road, they said that it would not have been a problem if the road was expanded beyond what it was. They expressed frustration over the situation, saying despite pleas over the years for the Federal Government to expand the road to accommodate the number of people residing in the area, nothing had been done. They pleaded for expansion of the road and construction of alternative routes not only because of gridlock but also in view of the security situation in the country. According to one of the motorists: “This is the only road connecting Mararaba/Nyanya to Abuja and it was of concern not just because of the inconvenience but the security risks it poses. People will not be able to escape if there is any security threat. “I remember when the Nigerian Army had altercation with the El-Zazaky members. Some people were trapped on the road because there is no alternative route while others could not get home till late in the night.”
