The Court of Appeal, Abuja Division, yesterday affirmed the victory of Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State at the July 14, 2018 governorship election in the state. The three-man panel of the court in a unanimous judgment which was delivered at about 7:14pm last night , dismissed the appeal filed by the Peoples Democratic Party and its candidate in the election, Mr. Olusola Eleka. In the lead judgement delivered by Justice Stephen Adah, the court described the appeal as unmeritorious . The court however affirmed the judgment of the Ekiti State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal which upheld Fayemiâ€™s victory at the poll. The Independent National Electoral Commission had declared that Fayemi and his party, the All Progressives Congress, polled a total of 197,459 votes to defeat Eleka and the PDP who placed second with 178,121 votes in the July 14, 2018 election. Not satisfied with the result, PDP and Eleka had filed a petition before the Ekiti State Election Petition Tribunal which sat and delivered its judgement in Abuja. The petitioners alleged, among others in their petition, that the election was marred by a lot of wrongs, including non-compliance with the Electoral Act. But the tribunal on January 28, 2019 dismissed their petition and affirmed the results declared by INEC. Still not satisfied, Eleka and his party further appealed to the Court of Appeal, raising seven issues against the judgment of the tribunal. The court however resolved all the seven issues raised against the appellants and in favour of the respondents, Fayemi, INEC and APC. The court, which had conducted a hearing on the appeal earlier on Tuesday, dismissed the case in its judgment on Thursday for lacking in merit.
