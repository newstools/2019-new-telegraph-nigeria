D’Tigers’ captain, Ike Diogu, has said that the FIBA Basketball World Cup draw pitching Nigeria against Russia, Argentina and South Korea is a tough one. “We feel very good with our draw. In order to get respect worldwide, the road we must travel through is Europe meaning we have to play the best European teams to get the respect Africa deserves,” he said. Diogu, having competed at the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympic Games and 2017 FIBA Afrobasket tournaments, will be looking forward to making his debut for Nigeria at the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup in China. D’Tigers’ coach, Alex Nwora, had stated after the draws that only the best hands would be selected for the 2019 FIBA World Cup for men. The 2.03m (6ft8in) power forward has been a dominant force for Nigeria, scoring in double-figures in all but 2 games and is one of the most experienced players in Nwora’s team. “All these teams are a threat. We can’t take any of them lightly because they all have the ability to beat us. Argentina is one of the best in the world as is Russia so we have a very tough task in front of us,” Diogu said. “It’s the biggest stage for me. I’ve never played in the World Cup so I’m extremely excited to be a part of this and the guys want to make sure we do something special that the continent has not seen.” According to the tournament schedule released by FIBA on Monday, D’Tigers will start their campaign against Russia on Saturday, August 31 before taking on Argentina on September 2 in Wuhan. Their final group game will be against South Korea on Wednesday, September 4, 2019.
