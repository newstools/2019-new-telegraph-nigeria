 The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has accused Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of denying its presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar access to inspect the documents and materials used in the February 23 presidential election in accordance with ruling of the Court of Appeal. The party described it as a ploy to frustrate him and PDP to timeously file its petition at the presidential election tribunal. In a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP disclosed that its legal team wrote the INEC Chairman on March 11, and 12 respectively, causing the order to be served on the commission, requesting access to the said documents and materials. “Despite being served with the order and several follow-ups, the leadership of INEC has refused to grant the PDP and Atiku Abubakar access to the materials and documents, notwithstanding the urgency of the matter. “This action by the leadership of INEC has further exposed that it has been heavily compromised by the Buhari’s presidency to rig the February 23, 2019 presidential election and to frustrate the quest by Nigerians to reclaim the mandate from President Muhammadu Buhari and save the nation from the crisis of an illegitimate government,” the statement added. It further accused INEC and the All Progressives Congress (APC) of seeking to frustrate the court option, noting that the documents and materials would expressly show that Atiku clearly won the election by the votes directly delivered at the polling units across the country. “INEC should, therefore, end its unpatriotic partisan shenanigans with the APC and immediately obey the Court of Appeal and grant the PDP and Atiku Abubakar access to the documents and materials and free itself from unholy entanglement with the APC against Nigerians,” PDP added.
