Do you know that God has allotted everyone a guardian Angel through which he saves us in times of troubles?” Consequently, chapter one, raises the question who are Angels? Instantly providing the answer from the scripture, catechism and etymologically, this chapter states with scriptural reference that, angels are the messengers of God, and are spoken of in the epistle to the Hebrews as “ministering spirits” in Heb. 1:14. It further reveals that there are good and bad angels. The good Angels are God’s angels while the bad Angels are of Satan. They were thrown down to earth from heaven with Lucifer. Also the Catechism of the Catholic Church defines Angels as being purposefully created by God to serve as messengers who hearken to his word and who will always do his will. They are celestial beings; they are spirits by nature and are immortal. Chapter Three, ‘Ministry of Angels’, focuses on what God said about Angels concerning humanity; they follow the word of God to make it powerful and produce result, hence, every child of God has Angels at his disposal. Psalm 91: 9-14 reveals how Angels are committed to ensure all round safety to mankind. Angels are charged with order to keep humanity, such that even the toes of our feet are not permitted to be hurt. This is because, “God has given his Angels charge over us, to keep us in all our ways. This means that Angel will move with us. You will not enter calamity, you will not see disappointment, you will not see failure, and you will not see barrenness again. The Angels of God chase the enemies”. This chapter lists the types of angels as: Angels that are messengers, Angel of wars, Angel of judgment, Angel of the throne of Angels and Guardian Angels. Chapter four deals with how to implore the help of angels; it asserts that children of God must cultivate the habit of praise and worship, because Angels lead in praise and worship all the time in heaven, and as you join them in praise and worship to God, they also join you in anything that concerns your life. Paul and Silas in Act 16, praised and worshiped God, while in the prison God’s glory came and open the prison door for their freedom, in your problems praise and worship God, and he will come or sent an Angel like in (Act 12) while Peter was in prison, the church prayed and an Angel was sent for his release. Chapters five, Six, seven God’s mercy towards us by Sending His Angels, Angels and Violent Earthquake, The Battle of Edom respectively, dwell on how God uses angels to protect and guide us from the devices of the devil, cause earthquake in the kingdom of Satan that will shake every kingdom that is against you joy and the Angel will uproot any evil buried against you, your family, your business, your wife, your husband, your brothers and sisters, give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man through God we shall do valiantly: for him, it is that shall tread down our enemies. In Chapters eight, nine, ten, Revoking Evil Dedication, Prayer against Terrifying Problems and Prayer against Destiny Killers, accordingly explain what evil dedication, terrifying problems and destiny killers are and itemized prayer points that will be used to battle them. With the advice that if you do the prayers with faith, your miracle is a must, chapter eight present 63 prayer points, Chapters Nine, 100 prayer points and Chapters ten, 122 prayer points. The chapters also counsel that before you pray these prayers points; go into a period of praise and thanksgiving, to do the prayers for nine days with fasting and every mid-night if you can.
