A man, identified simply as Chidiebere, at weekend reportedly stabbed and killed his cousin who was fast asleep in Aba, Abia State over a N500 disagreement. Chidiebere had a disagreement with his cousin, Chisom, who did not take the matter seriously until the former killed him. The incident, which occurred near Ebiogwu Street, Ogbor-Hill axis of Aba, reportedly sent caused confusion. Chisom, who was 27, lived with his aunt (Chidiebere’s mother) who operates small restaurant. The family also resided in the same Ogbor-Hill axis of the commercial city where the deceased shared the same room with his killer cousin. A source close to the family traced the genesis of the crisis to last week when his aunt had gone to the market to buy things and asked him to take charge of the business while she was away. After his mother had gone to the market, Chidiebere allegedly entered the shop and demanded that the late Chisom give him N500. But Chisom refused to give him the money, insisting that his aunt (Chidiebere’s mother) never approved of such. Chidiebere, it was learnt, insisted that the money must be given to him. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Geoffrey Ogbonna, confirmed the incident. Ogbonna said the suspect was already in police custody. He said: “The incident, which is a very unfortunate one, did happen. The two are related and the other one had to stab his cousing because of N500. “The suspect has been arrested and the deceased taken to the morgue. The case will soon be transferred to the State Criminal Investigations and Intelligence Department (SCIID) for detail investigation.”
