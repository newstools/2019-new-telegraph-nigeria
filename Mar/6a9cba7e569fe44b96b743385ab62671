The statement reads: “Events in the recent past has shown the desperation of the opposition All Progressive Congress (APC) to cow our members to fear through harassment and intimidation using Federal might and security agencies by arresting some of our members. “The party wishes to inform the world the that the attitude of the main opposition APC) especially during the last elections held on Saturday the 23rd of February, 2019 leaves much to be desired. “It is on record that before the election, the APC, known to be the financiers and sponsors of the dreaded Kalare political thugs, went about harassing and destroying properties of our members especially our campaign posters in different parts of the state whenever they came out for their campaign rallies. “This is however done in the eyes of security agencies and without them taking necessary action.” The campaign council said it is regrettable that the APC and their leadership want to bring back the dark days of Kalare activities which the present administration had tried so hard to eradicate, adding that, “These Kalare activities are not only worrisome, but stands as a threat to our nascent democracy.” The statement reads further: “We call on our members and supporters to remain peaceful, calm, law abiding and come out en mass to vote Senator Usman Bayero Nafada and all State House of Assembly candidates during next Saturday’s Governorship and State Assembly elections. “The PDP campaign council  is assuring the people of the State that it will continue from where the present administration of Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo has stopped in developing the state in all spheres of endeavour if given the mandate.”
