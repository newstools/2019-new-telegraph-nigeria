The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has deployed three more Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) to oversee the Saturday’s governorship supplementary election in Kano State. The RECs drafted to Kano for the supplementary election include that of Zamfara, Professor Asamau Sani Maikudi and Professor Ganiyu Raji from Ogun State and that of Kebbi. The electoral commission body said it is prepared for the supplementary gubernatorial election in the 28 local government areas of the state. No fewer than 128,324 registered voters are going to participate in the exercise.According to the state REC, Professor Risqua Arabi Shehu, the March 23 gubernatorial election was declared inconclusive due to issues that arose from the election. The Kano REC said the cancellation was due in part to over-voting in 22 local governments; cancelation of results in 15 local governments due to vio-lence, while Bunkure local government had voting done on manual processes. Risqua hinted that the election will hold in 28 local governments, 75 registrations areas, 207 polling units, and 279 voting units. He said: “In the 15 local governments, there are 116 units with 73,173 registered voters and in 22 local governments there are 91 polling units with 55,150 registered voters”. The REC explained that the security agencies have reviewed their strategy in tackling all uncertainties that may face the reruns. While warning the political gladiators to en-sure that they play by the rules of the game, he said, “Security agencies would not tolerate any breach of peace from any persons or groups” just as he urged the media to do all they could in propagating peace in the state
