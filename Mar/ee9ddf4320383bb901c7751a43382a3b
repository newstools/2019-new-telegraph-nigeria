Former Senate President, Chief Ameh Ebute, has written the United States President, Donald Trump, over the recent report by US Department of State titled, “2018 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.” The elder statesman, in a letter entitled “Time To Break off The Disintegration Of Nigeria:” An Open Letter, urged the US Government to investigate the researchers who packaged the report and apply appropriate sanctions on them for official ineptitude as advertised by the poor job. Ebute said he was acting on his capacity as an elder citizen and leader in Nigeria to write the open letter in order to correct certain erroneous impressions and strengthen the records on the punchy assault on the human rights direction of the incumbent leadership of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) under President Muhammadu Buhari, and the Nigerian Military, especially the Nigerian Army.
