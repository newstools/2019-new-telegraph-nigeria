Former Super Eagles captain, Austin Okocha, has doused worries over the possibility of him going to jail, as the exinternational says he has settled the issue that led to a Lagos court ordering his arrest. In contrast with worries among Nigerian soccer lovers at home and abroad, over the likelihood for the former English Premier League star ending up behind bars due to contempt of court, ‘Jay Jay’ says the matter is settled and there is no cause for concern. The former PSG and Bolton Wanderers star feigned ignorance of the development, saying he was not in the know about factors that led to the arrest warrant in the first place, claiming he had not been contacted over the matter. He insisted further that he was not aware of his alleged failure to pay income tax, which led to Igbosere High Court on Lagos Island issuing a bench warrant for his arrest. Okocha who also played for Eintracht Frankfurt, Fernebahce and Hull City in a glamorous career had been dragged to court by Lagos State Ministry of Justice on a three-count charge of failure to pay tax or make a return of his income, but Okocha says he was not formally contacted. The 45-year-old added: “I only read about it on the pages of newspapers. No one contacted me. “As a citizen of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, I know very well that nobody is above the law. “Honestly speaking, I was never contacted by anybody on issues before the court order (but) it has been settled.”
