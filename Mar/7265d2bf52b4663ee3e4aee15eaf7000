The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, yesterday, fixed March 25, to deliver judgement in a suit seeking to stop the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from resuming collation or announcing result of Tafawa Balewa Local Government Area of Bauchi State. Justice Inyang Ekwo fixed the date after counsel in the matter adopted their written addresses. The All Progressives Congress, (APC) and Bauchi State governor, Mohammed Abubakar, had approached the court, asking it to restrain INEC from further collation and announcing the results of the March 9 governorship election in the state. They were challenging the commissionâ€™s decision to resume collation, conclude and announce results of Tafawa Balewa Local Government Area in respect of the election to the office of governor of Bauchi State The plaintiffs asked the court for a declaration that INEC, having led them to believe that there would be a supplementary election, could not go back and continue with collation of ballots that a Returning Officer had termed rejected. They maintained that the powers of the returning officer, having declared the election inconclusive, could only be upturned by a court and not by INEC. In his submission, counsel to the plaintiffs, Ahmed Raji (SAN) submitted that INEC was wrong to have challenged the jurisdiction of the court to hear the matter and referred them to an Election Petition Tribunal. According to Raji, the only instance where an election petition tribunal was conferred with jurisdiction to hear such a matter was where a winner was announced. Raji urged the court to overrule the objection of INEC, noting that if it was not overruled, his client would be left with no remedy.
