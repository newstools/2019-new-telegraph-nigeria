Rita Chikwelu scored twice to save Nigeria’s blushes with a 4-3 win over Slovakia on Friday at the Cyprus Invitational Cup. Spanked 4-1 by Austria at AEK Arena on Wednesday, pressure was on the Africans champions to end their poor run against European oppositions and they left it late to snatch a win at the Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium. Chikwelu’s brace plus strikes from Oshinachi Ohale and Anam Imo guaranteed Thomas Dennerby’s side their first win at tournament serving as build up for the FIFA Women’s World Cup holding in France between June and July. The Super Falcons got themselves in front after Chikwelu broke the deadlock with an assist from Alice Ogebe after just seven minutes into the game. Ohale doubled the lead for the African queens in the 28th minute before Francisca Ordega set up Chikwelu for her second and Nigeria’s third of the match seven minutes from half time. In the second half, Nigeria were handed a penalty to increase their tally but the Kristianstad midfielder missed the chance to score her third of the game from the spot in the 56th minute. With Dennerby ringing some changes, Slovaks profited from the Africans’ defensive blunders when Jana Vojtekova pulled one back in the 67th minute. Heading to their eighth successive Mundial, the Falsons saw themselves in some trouble as they shockingly conceded twice from the spot, with Lucia Harsanyova’s brace canceling their lead in the 72nd and 76th minute respectively. However, substitute Asisat Oshoala teed up substitute Anam Imo for the winner as Thomas Dennerby’s ladies condemned the unrelenting Slovaks to their second defeat of the tournament. Nigeria now has three points and will need a win against Group C leaders Belgium in their last match to progress to the knock out stage. The match is scheduled for the GSZ Stadium, Larnaca on March 4.
