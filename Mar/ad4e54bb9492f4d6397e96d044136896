The Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday debunked the speculations that the ruling party was desperately lobbying some eminent Nigerians and international bodies to prevail on the Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar not to seek legal redress over the outcome of the February 23 election. Director of Strategic Communications, APC Presidential Campaign Council, Mr. Festus Keyamo (SAN) who responded to the speculations, said the PCC did not at any time prevail on Atiku not to proceed to court to challenge the result of the election as it was within his rights as a Nigerian to challenge the election if he had reasons to doubt the credibility of its outcome Keyamo, however in a statement, admitted that a letter was purportedly written by a certain group known as ‘Buhari Campaign Organisation’ asking some international organisations to stop Atiku and the PDP from challenging Buhari’s victory in court.
He dissociated the PCC from the action, insisting that the group acted on its own. “Our official position is that we believe that Alhaji Atiku Abubakar has a constitutional right to seek redress in court and we do not seek in any way to curtail that right. In fact, it is the resort to court that is the only democratic way to ventilate his perceived grievance and any attempt to restrict or discourage the exercise of such right would be an invitation to anarchy. “In addition, we are very anxious to meet Alhaji Atiku Abubakar in court in order to show the world in a conclusive manner the free and fair nature of the comprehensive defeat of Atiku at the polls,” he said.
