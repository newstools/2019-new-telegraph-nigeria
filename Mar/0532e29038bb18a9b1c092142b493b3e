 President of the newly-formed Authentic Nigeria Football Supporters Club, Abayomi Ogunjimi, has revealed to New Telegraph that his members would storm the ancient city of Ibadan for the burial of former Nigeria Football Federation Secretary General, Taiwo Ogunjobi.
Ogunjimi said the late footballer turned administrator was like a father to him and some of his members and the best way to pay their last respect was to be at his burial. He added that the late Ogunjobi’s contributions to football in the country cannot be wished away and pray to God to give the family the fortitude to bear the loss. “The death of Ogunjobi, who is like a father to many of us was a very sad one and I am already mobilizing some of our members to be in Ibadan from Wednesday,” he said.
“We are aware of the programme put together starting from Tuesday in Oshogbo and Ibadan from Wednesday to Friday. “Like I said, the main motive of this group is not to rub shoulder with those that are there at the moment, but to bridge the gap between the older generation and the upcoming fans.
“At the moment we are on Facebook (AuthenticNFSC-Fanpage), Twitter (@authenticsuppo1) and Instagram (Authenticnfsc) so that all Nigerians can be part of the group from wherever they are, either within the country or outside.
