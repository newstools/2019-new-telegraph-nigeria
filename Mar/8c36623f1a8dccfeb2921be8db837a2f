 Solomon Ogbeide, Coach of Lobi Stars, the country’s representative in the CAF Champions League, has blamed the recent loss of the club against Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa on lack of information. Speaking in Enugu on Friday, Ogbeide said they were not aware of the in eligibility of one of their players, Alex Otakho, for the game until they got to South Africa. While urging all the departments of the club to live up to their responsibilities, the coach, however, said they have learnt a lot from the competition and would help them going forward. “Everybody in a football club is important. So, any mistake made by anybody is visited on the team and information is very vital and we should improve on it,” he said. “It was in South Africa that we learnt that Otakho was ineligible and CAF is an organised authority and they do not make mistakes. ”We expect that players and their booking should be communicated to clubs days before their match for teams to get their house in order. ”This will help to produce the best team at the end of the competition. “Had it been that I knew before hand, my preparation would have taken another dimension without the midfielder and we would have come out of the match unscathed.” Ogbeide also said the financial strength of the two clubs also played a part in the game as the Nigeria side cannot afford the luxury of travelling with their fans for most of their away games. Lobi’s elimination was finalized on Saturday despite their 2-0 defeat of ASEC Mimosas as they finished in third position behind Wydad Casablanca and Mamelodi Sundowns who finished first and second on the table.
