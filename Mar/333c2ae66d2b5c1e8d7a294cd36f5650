 The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has urged bank customers in the country who have complaints about non-reversal of failed Point-Of Sale (PoS) transactions into their accounts not to hesitate to escalate their grievance to the apex bank’s Consumer Protection Department if they perceive that their financial institution is not handing the issue with the seriousness that it deserves. Deputy Director, Payment Systems Management Department, at CBN, Mr. Francis Wasa, stated this at a press briefing held by industry stakeholders to discuss the rising number of customer complaints over failed PoS transactions. Wasa said: “If a customer is dissatisfied with the manner in which a bank is handling a PoS transaction failure complaint, such a customer should immediately escalate the complaint to the Consumer Protection Department of CBN. CBN has provided clear guidelines on how banks should handle customers’ complaints.” Also, speaking at the event, the Acting Chief Executive Officer/ Managing Director, Nigeria Interbank Settlement System (NIBSS), Mr. Niyi Ajao, urged bank customers to immediately report a complaint of failed PoS transaction to their banks. He said the stakeholders’ meeting was triggered by the rising number of complaints of dispense errors and non-reversal of failed transactions at PoS terminals and some other electronic banking channels.
According to him, NIBSS, the CBN, commercial banks and other stakeholders were making efforts to address the challenges. He said the meeting by the stakeholders was to improve on poor network quality for e-payment transactions by extending the time it takes to complete a transaction, especially, PoS and restore confidence in the e-payment system.
He revealed that the meeting focused on issues such as time-out, reversals, capacity enhancement and monitoring. Timeout is the total Turn-Around-Time (TAT) for a PoS transaction cycle, from the time it is received from a PoS to the time a response is sent back to the terminal.
