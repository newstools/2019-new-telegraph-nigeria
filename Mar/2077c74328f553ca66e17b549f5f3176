Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa yesterday said the state government had put machinery in place to cheer the Super Eagles of Nigeria to victory over their Seychelles counterpart during their African Cup of Nation qualifying encounter in Asaba on Friday. The Governor, who said the encounter would afford the Eagles to convince Nigerians on how prepared the team has repositioned for future tournaments, hailed the arrival of high-flying footballers for the competition. He vowed that the job of shouting for praise and encouragement to make the Eagles to be more gallant will not be left in the hands of the Supporters’ Club alone. Speaking through his Commissioner for Information, Chief Patrick Ukah, who doubles as the Vice Chairman of the Local Organising Committee, the Governor expressed hope that Eagles will spring surprises and defeat the Seychelles team. He warned Very Very Important Persons (VVIP) and other dignitaries against ‘Free-For-All-Syndrome’ at the reserved seats for highly-placed persons, maintaining that anyone who considers himself or herself as a VVIP or VIP person , should be ready to pay N10,000 and N3,000 per seat respectively. He said: “With Eagles, Seychelles and Egypt team members and their fans already arriving Delta state for the tournament, it is obvious that the state is going to be inundated with festival of sports. This is what the state is known for and we take pride in it. The security and other basic arrangements have been concluded for a hitch-free football encounter.” He said that would not mark the end, he promised that from time to time, the state will continue to attract events that will engender peaceful co-existence, serve as a unifying factor among Nigerian states and other continents, and boost the progress of Delta.
