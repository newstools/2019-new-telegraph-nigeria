 Nigeria’s provisional Balance of Payments (BOP) estimates for Q4 2018 showed a significant improvement in the BOP outcome, as the overall balance of payments recorded a surplus of $2.80 million compared to a huge deficit of $4,542.08 million and a surplus of $6,180.40 million recorded in the preceding quarter and corresponding period of 2017, respectively, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has said.
The Apex Bank stated this in its, “Brief on Balance of Payments Statistics” for Q4 2018 released yesterday. Financial experts describe the balance of payment of a country as the record of all economic transactions between the residents of the country and of the world in a particular period. The CBN data also shows that the Current Account Balance (CAB) improved from a deficit of $1,544.41 million in Q3 2018 to a surplus of $1,104.57 million in Q4 2018.”
The regulator attributed the development largely to the: “decrease in imports and payments on income (net).” Similarly, the report stated: “the financial account balance indicated a net acquisition of financial assets of $2,327.91 million in the review period as against a net incurrence of financial liabilities of $4,615.17 million recorded in the preceding period.” According to the CBN, the surplus in the Goods Account also increased significantly to $6,793.60 million in Q4 2018 from surpluses of $3,759.88 million in the preceding quarter and $5,472.74 million recorded in the corresponding period of 2017. The report equally stated : “Export earnings rose by 2.8 per cent to US$16,655.49 million in Q4 2018 when compared with Q3 2018. It also indicated an increase of about 27.6 per cent when compared to corresponding Period of 2017. Earnings from crude oil and gas, which accounted for 93.8 per cent of total export earnings during the review period, increased by 2.1 per cent to $15,620.90 million in Q4 2018 when compared with the preceding quarter. Earnings from non-oil and electricity exports rose by 15.0 per cent to $1034.59 million in Q4 2018 when compared with the preceding quarter. “Available data showed that payments for import of goods (fob) to the economy in the review period decreased significantly by 20.7 per cent to US$9,861.89 million below the level recorded in the preceding quarter. This was largely as a result of 19.9 per cent decrease in the imports of non-oil products,” the report added. Another highlight of the study was that net out-payments for services during the review period increased by 16.5 per cent to a deficit of $8,287.57 million when compared with the level recorded in Q3 2018.
