The coach of Ifeanyi Ubah Football Club, Uche Okagbue, expressed confidence in the abilities of the Flying Eagles to do Nigeria proud at the FIFA U-20 World Cup slated for Poland in May. Okagbue said the team needed to be more cohesive and play with the grit and panache often associated with Nigerian teams. “The team shouldn’t be described as bad based on their performances at the African Cup of Nations. What I think went wrong with the side was that the players were individualistic, lacking coordination between the midfield and the attack,” noted. He advised the technical crew to work more on the team’s attack, adding that a potent strike force would help them progress in the championship. He was also quick to admonish the team to be wary of the potential dangers posed by one of their Group D opponents United States of America. “I am not writing Qatar and Ukraine off; but I would advise that we take the Americans seriously. They have the pedigree of producing top young players, as well as doing well at youth tournaments,” Okagbue said.
