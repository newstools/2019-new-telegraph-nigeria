Ahead of the official release of the long-anticipated movie, Kunle Afolayan, Nollywood actor and film producer, has screened ‘Mokalik’ in front of a selected audience. The screening, which held at Twin Waters in Victoria Island, Lagos state, on Tuesday, was graced by Tunde Kelani; Jahman Anikulapo; Simi and some other notable personalities in the movie production industry. The movie explains the career of an 11-year-old boy of a middle-class suburb who spends the day as a lowly apprentice at the mechanic workshop in order to understand life from the other side of the tracks. “MOKALIK is an ambitious film project that tells a story which is unique and relevant to our society. It beautifully highlights diversity while distinctively addressing the issues around choice,” the award-winning movie told guests who attended the screening. “This was why I chose to situate life’s happenstances in a typical Nigerian mechanic workshop.” Written by Tunde Babalola and directed by Kunle Afolayan, “Mokalik” features Afropop Diva, Simi, and BBN ex-housemate, Tobi Bakre.
