A number of shut textile mills in the country may re-open for production in 2019 as Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sustained engagements with members of the National Cotton Association of Nigeria (NACOTAN) and other key stakeholders in cotton and textile value chain, New Telegraph learnt in Abuja. A decision to ensure some textile mills come up this year was reached at a follow up meeting between CBN and key stakeholders in textile and cotton value chain that held last Monday at the CBN headquarters in Abuja. National President, NACOTAN, Mr. Anibe Achimugu, confirmed to New Telegraph that his members had a follow up meeting with the CBN governor. This, he said, was aside of maiden meeting that took place three weeks ago. He said Nigerians `would begin to see more textile industries open for production in 2019 going by CBN’s commitment. “You know the process is a journey that begins with a step. But I want to assure you that, you will feel the impact of cotton production and revival of textile mills in Nigeria this year. For Cotton, I can assure you that we get all the requirements in place – the volumes of cotton that you will see harvested in October, November and December would surpass the current 80,000 to 100,000 tonnes which the country has produced,” he said. Achimugu noted that CBN has mapped out plans to re-tool obsolete equipment of textile industries.
