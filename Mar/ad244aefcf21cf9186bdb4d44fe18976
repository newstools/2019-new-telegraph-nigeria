An Ado-Ekiti High Court yesterday sentenced two persons, Adedayo Oluwayemi (27) and Daramola Seyi (23), to death by hanging.
The convicts robbed a night club in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State. Justice John Adeyeye, who handed down the sentence, held that the men were guilty of the two-count charge of armed robbery and conspiracy preferred against them. The judge found them guilty of violating Section 516 of the Criminal Code Cap C16 Laws of Ekiti State 2012 and Section 1(2) (b) of Robbery and Firearms (Special Provision) Act Laws of the Federation 2014. Adeyeye, however, discharged and acquitted the third accused, Ogunleye Ige, on the grounds that evidence before the court showed that there was no nexus between him and the incident. The convicts invaded Ckib 15 Dynamic Lounge, Irewumi, opposite Bawa Estate, Ado-Ekiti on August 4, 2018 with guns and robbed the victims of their valuables such as laptops, phones and proceeds of sales for the day.
They were arrested at the point of selling the stolen items particularly the laptops and phones when they could not provide the passwords.
The accused were first arraigned on October 16, 2017 when the charges were read to them which they pleaded not guilty to. Prosecution counsel, Felix Awoniyi, called six witnesses and tendered exhibits including the two laptops.
Defence counsel, Toyin Oluwole, did not call any witness in the course of the trial.
