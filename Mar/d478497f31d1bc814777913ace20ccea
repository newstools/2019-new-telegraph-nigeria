As the world marked the International Women’s Day, Senator Oluremi Tinubu, yesterday tasked the men in the country and other well-meaning Nigerians to speak up in support of women, saying that the nation would benefit so much from gender balance. Tinubu, in a statement to commemorate the 2019 International Women’s Day, joined other world leaders in the celebration of womenfolk, saying that to adequately entrench the rights of women, abrogate gender-based violence and ensure equal opportunities for all; men have a role to play. According to Tinubu, who represents Lagos Central senatorial district in the National Assembly, beyond the recognition of the struggles and achievements of womenfolk, the day marked a celebration of womanhood, her strength, resilience, power and doggedness. She said: “I celebrate with Nigerian women all over the world on the occasion of the International Women’s Day, 2019. “This year, there are two themes in commemoration of International Women’s Day – ‘Balance for Better’ and “Think Equal, Build Smart, Innovate for Change.” While both themes may appear to be at variance, they are both pointers to the way forward in the quest for the protection of rights of women and a reminder that we must devise new strategies in the pursuit of gender equity and balance.
