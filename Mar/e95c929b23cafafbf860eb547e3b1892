Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State yesterday denied insinuation that the motive behind the proposed creation of Local Council Development Areas (LCDA) was driven by politics. The governor, who was speaking during inauguration of 11-man committee headed by Prince Lanke Odogiyan for the creation of the LCDAs said the socio- economic wellbeing of the people was paramount in his mind. There were insinuations in the state that the governor wanted to create LCDAs in order to get political advantage over the opposition, saying the state did not have enough fund to maintain additional council areas. But Akeredolu explained that the decision was not conceived or designed to whittle the influence of anyone or elevate any individual above his peers. He said: “It is far from the so-called recognition extended to political leaders. It is for the ultimate benefit of the people. It is our expectation that this exercise will restore their dignity and pride as prime producers, and not as incurable consumers of other people’s ideas and products. “We remember our promise during electioneering campaigns on the issue of the creation of more local governments from the existing ones. We are aware that the agitation for representation is becoming more strident. Our people are speaking loudly but it’s our responsibility to guide them.”
