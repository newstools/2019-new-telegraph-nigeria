The God of creation has directed our noble course to build a nation where peace and justice shall reign in return to the national prayers made by the founding fathers of this nation close to sixty years now, by the entrance of the jinx breaker, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu into the senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. To the hopeless,the helpless, homeless, voiceless, to the intimidated, violated and marginalised, better days are here again. To those who seek unity, peace and progress in Abia North,Abia State, Igbo Nation and the Nigerian Nation-State your God has risen. Hopes of our people have been rekindled, Faith have been strengthened,forgiveness freely given, unity reinvigorated and the spirit of nationalism reawakened from slumber, atmosphere all over Nigeria charged with love for each other across tribes, similar to the feeling that flow whenever our national football team the Super Eagles defeat a giant football nation in a world cup tournament, these were the realities the resonated the moment INEC called on Kalu to receive his certificate of Return, it clearly depicted beyond being reasonably contended that Orji Kalu is indeed a symbol of national unity. Let me also most respectfully appeal to the PDP candidate who was squarely defeated in that election to accept the olive branch which Kalu has always offered his opponents in anything in life, the way the APGA candidate in that keenly contested election has done, even as the PDP candidate for the House of Representative in the constituency of the defeated PDP Senatorial candidate has affirmed the credibility of that national assembly election, litigating on this subject matter shall amount to nothing as there is nothing to be litigated upon, ex nihilo nihil fit, out of nothing comes nothing. It is better we all join our heads together and pursue our common course as a people than to put up any conduct that may cause distractions for Kalu whom God put in our mist for the liberation of the entire Igbo nation. To the distinguished incoming 9th Assembly of the Federal Republic on Nigeria, I most respectfully urge them to see the unity and love amongst the people of Nigeria as sacrosanct and paramount by ensuring that the principal positions are most equitably and evenly distributed to all geo-political zones for the sake of equity and good conscience and in conformity with the relevant laws, worthy of serious consideration is the office of the President of the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria , off course, I am duly aware of Rule 3 Order (2) of the Extant Senate Standing Orders which states as follows; “Nomination of senators to serve as Presiding Officers and appointments of Principal Officers and other Officers of the Senate or on any Parliamentary delegations shall be in accordance with the ranking of Senators. In determining ranking, the following Oder shall apply- (i) Senators retiring based on number of times re-elected; (ii) Senators who had been members of the House of Representatives; and (iii) Senators elected as Senators for the first time.” In as much as the validity of this rule is not being contended, we should also have in mind, the position of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (As Amended)upon which the supremacy of all laws in Nigeria are vested by the operation of Section 1(3) of the same Constitution. Under Section 60 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (As Amended) it is expressly provided “Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the Senate or the House of Representatives shall have power to regulate its own procedure, including the procedure for summoning and recess of the House” and the full understanding of the position which the framers of this law in their wisdom seek to further advance is in the defect which was already cured under Chapter 2 of the 1999 Constitution of the FRN(As Amended) captioned the Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy, precisely under Section 14(3) “The composition of the Government of the Federation or any of its agencies and the conduct of its affairs shall be carried out in such a manner as to reflect the federal character of Nigeria and the need to promote national unity, and also to command national loyalty, thereby ensuring that there shall be no predominance of persons from a few State or from a few ethnic or other sectional groups in that Government or in any of its agencies”. Therefore, flowing from the above, we make a passionate appeal to the consciences of the Senators-elect under the APC to zone the Senate president to the South East for the sake of equity and in line with the spirit of federal character recognised in our Constitution, it is constitutional,lawful, legitimate and in accordance with the dictates of the common conscience of Nigerian people whereas not doing so shall seem to be at variance with our national consciousness and laws at the same time repugnant to equity and fairness. To those of the APC senators elected from the Southeast who may be looking at themselves as qualified going by the pre requisites, please let the overriding interests of Ndi-Igbo be considered over your personal interests by putting forward the person with wider reach and clout who shall be capable of utilising the paraphernalia of that office to the best benefit of Ndi- Igbo and Nigeria, whether such a person is most qualified among you or not but once he is qualified on general grounds, there are precedents where the Senate president emerged not strictly on the premise of the most ranking. It is our expectation that the 9th Assembly shall do justice to the Igbo nation to build a nation where peace and justice shall reign as we have been desirous, which we prayed in our national anthem. Let us remember that justice is an expression of our mutual recognition of each other’s basic dignity, and an acknowledgement that if we are to live together in an interdependent community we must treat each other as equals. According to Plato, Individually “justice is a ‘human virtue’ that makes a man self consistent and good: Socially, justice is a social consciousness that makes a society internally harmonious and good.” And in the words of Thomas Aquinas, Justice is the firm and constant will to give to everyone that which is due.   ●Agbaeze, a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) wrote in from Abuja
