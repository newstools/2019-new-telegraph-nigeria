 A lawyer, Mr. Olanrewaju Ajanaku, representing the alleged kidnap kingpin, Chikwudumeme Onwiamadike alias Evans, yesterday skipped proceedings at an Ikeja Special Offences Court, Lagos, over unpaid legal fees by his client. Ajanaku, who has failed to appear in court to defend his client for the second time, told the court that Evans’ family was yet to perfect its brief in terms of financial commitment. Evans is standing trial alongside a former Army officer, Victor Aduba, on a two-count charge of conspiracy and kidnapping.  During yesterday’s proceedings, the state prosecution counsel, A. O. Alagbe, informed the court of a letter by the defence counsel, stating reasons for his absence in court. He said: “My lord, just this morning, the defendant’s counsel brought a letter informing the court of his absence, stating that his client has not perfected his brief. “No date was, however, suggested in the said letter.”  The prosecutor further said that Evans’ counsel was yet to respond to the submissions filed in respect to the trial-within-trial where Evans and Aduba had claimed that they were tortured and forced to make confessional statements while in police custody. Meanwhile, Ajanaku is the second counsel hired by Evans to defend him in several kidnapping charges preferred against him by the Lagos State government both at the Ikeja High Court and the Igbosere High Court. Evans’ first lawyer, Olukoya Ogungbeje, had stopped representing the alleged kidnap kingpin on claims that his life was under threat. The presiding judge, Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo, thereafter adjourned the matter till March 29 for adoption of submissions in the trial within trial.
