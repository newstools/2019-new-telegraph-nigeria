…blames pitch condition for average performance  Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, has promised to look at the remaining two goalkeepers in the team, Ikechukwu Ezenwa and Daniel Akpeyi, in the international friendly game against Egypt on Tuesday. While defending the team’s first choice against Seychelles, Francis Uzoho, following his error on Friday, Rohr told our correspondent that despite the mistake, the technical crew would help the goalie. “On Friday, Uzoho made a mistake but anybody can make a mistake,” he said. “He came out of the goal while he was meant to stay, when a player have a problem, we have to help him, next game, we are going to see the reimaging two goalkeepers.” Uzohor was blamed for the goal scored by the Pirates of Seychelles in the final Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Seychelles on Friday. Super Eagles however won the game 3-1 with goals from Odion Ighalo, Henry Onyekuru and Moses Simon. The goalkeeper was however on Saturday drafted to the U-23 team ahead of their crucial U-23 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Libya billed for Monday. Meanwhile, the coach has blamed the pitch of the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba, for the below par performance of the Super Eagles against Seychelles. Rohr said: “The conditions were very difficult, because it was very hot and the players are complaining about the condition of the pitch but they did the job; scored two wonderful goals in the second half.”
