The Chief Medical Director of the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (UCTH), Prof. Thomas Agan, has pleaded with the striking resident doctors of the hospital to return to work in the interest of patients and the country. Agan, who made the appeal yesterday while speaking with newsmen in Calabar, Cross River State on efforts so far made to address the doctors’ numerous complaints, said: “The strike is not necessary.  It is a shame. I am not happy about it. Administering a tertiary institution such as this is not easy. No hospital can be self-sufficient. “Efforts are being made to clear the skipping arrears. Even after holding series of meetings with the doctors and assuring them that the arrears will  be paid, they still went ahead on Tuesday with the strike. I have gone to Abuja over the issue. I know that the government will pay.”  According to him, the doctors, who took the oath to save the lives of patients have now placed more value on their welfare than the lives of the people by going on strike.  “Have they thought of the economic implications and the lives involved? The crises at UCTH are instigated by people with pecuniary interest,” he argued. Agan, who, however, hinted that the teaching hospital spends huge amount of money on consumables meant for patients, but which are pilfered by staff of the hospital, added that many members of staff had been dismissed or punished for such acts and described such attitude to work as ‘attitudinal corruption.’  He also pointed out that he was being castigated and harassed over who succeeds him next month as the Chief Medical Director of the hospital, where he said over 80 per cent of the health workforce in the state is domiciled. “I am not the person who appoints CMD. It is the President, who appoints someone for the position, but, I am being castigated and harassed physically and spiritually by the workers,” he lamented.
