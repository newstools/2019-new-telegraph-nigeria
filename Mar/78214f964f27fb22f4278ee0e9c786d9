StarTimes subscribers will continue to enjoy live sporting action of the Europa League round of 16 second leg tie as English giants, Chelsea and Arsenal continue their quests for continental glory on Thursday.
Arsenal will host Rennes at the Emirate Stadium, while Chelsea will travel to Ukraine for the second leg of their tie against Dynamo Kiev. Both matches will be broadcast in Nigeria by StarTimes on its Channels 254 and 245. The Blues already have one foot in the next round courtesy of their 3-0 victory in the first leg, but they face a team that has scored 10 goals without reply in their three home games since returning from a winter break.
Chelsea will be looking to complete the job and seal their place on Thursday in the quarter-finals of the Europa League. Chelsea’s top-four hopes may not have made it through the weekend unscathed, having seen a top-four spot taken out of their hands courtesy of a 1-1 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers. Arsenal have it all to do on Thursday night as they bid to recover from a Europa League shock against Rennes. The Gunners slumped to a surprise 3-1 defeat in the first leg after seeing Sokratis Papadtathopoulos sent off before half time, however, Sunday’s win over Manchester United has revitalised the Gunners. Emery’s side have struggled away in the Europa League this term, but Iwobi’s away goal could prove crucial as a 2-0 win on the night would take them through.
