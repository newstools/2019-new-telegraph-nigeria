A 33-year-old clearing agent, who allegedly obtained N1.5 million from a businessman on the pretext of clearing three vehicles for him, was on Monday brought before an Apapa Chief Magistrates’ Court, Lagos. Daniel Eromosele, who resides at Mafoluku area of Lagos, is facing a two-count charge of stealing and obtaining money under false pretences. The Prosecutor, Insp. Ferdinand Asu, told the court that the defendant committed the offences sometime in January at Apapa Port, Lagos. Asu said that the defendant fraudulently obtained the sum of N1.5 million from the complainant, one Mr Adebowale Ojerinde, on the pretext of assisting him to clear three vehicles. He said that the defendant collected money from the complainant and refused to clear the vehicles as promised. Asu alleged that when Ojerinde demanded for his money, the accused started giving flimsy excuses. According to him, the complainant reported the case to the police and the accused was arrested for questioning. The prosecutor said that the offences contravened Sections 287 and 314 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 287 prescribes three years imprisonment for stealing, while Section 314 stipulates 15-year jail term for obtaining by false pretence, if convicted. The Chief Magistrate, Mr Michael Olubi, granted the accused N200, 000 bail with two sureties in like sum. Olubi said that the sureties must be gainfully employed and should show evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. He adjourned the case until April 8 for mention. (NAN)
