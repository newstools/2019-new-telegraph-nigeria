Love is amazing and sweet but not everyone is lucky enough to find the perfect one for them or have the opportunity of meeting their soul mate in a lifetime. In fact, it is known that most people fall for those who do not love them and break the hearts of those who do. Love can be complicated and it often deals with the heart more than physical appearance. Nigerian actress, Daniella Okeke, seems to be learning the hard way after she recently revealed that love is an ‘illusion’. In a lengthy post, the actress seemed to be speaking from the heart when she stated that she is often unlucky in love and end up being heartbroken when she truly starts to care about someone. Okeke also seemed to be directing her words to a particular person when she stated that the person does not understand what love is. Interestingly, Daniella has over 300,000 followers on Instagram and with all the admirers wanting to love her freely, things are not how she wants it. Probably attests the statement that love on social media is not same as in reality. Blessed with a gorgeous figure, all Daniella wants is for her love to be reciprocated. Meanwhile, just recently, the curvy actress recently took to her Instagram page with a photo post in which she had disclosed that she was in search of a marriage partner and also lamented her Nigerian citizenship. Okeke said that she was tired of her country and posed a question in which she had asked that who was going to marry her.
