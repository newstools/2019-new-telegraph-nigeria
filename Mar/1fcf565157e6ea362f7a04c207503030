Rivers State Governor, Barr. Nyesom Wike, has said that those that want to shed blood in the state because of the governorship election on Saturday will fail. He said that nobody has committed any offence that would warrant death sentence to be passed on them. He said that the state operate a kind of politics that doesn’t give room to godfathers to operate, alleging that transport minister, Chibuikem Rotimi Amaechi wants to cause violence in the state because he wants to install a governor. Speaking yesterday at a town hall meeting attended by leaders of Rivers East Senatorial District in Bori, Wike, however urged the people to be peaceful and vigilant to ensure that their votes counted. He said those who plan to use security forces to kill Rivers people should know that the security personnel would come and go but Rivers State will remain. He said: “Those who want to shed blood in Rivers State will never succeed. I don’t know why they are plotting to destroy the state. We never caused any problems in the APC. “APC fought themselves and pushed themselves out of the race. Now, they want to kill everyone in the state. What is the offence of Rivers people that we must all die because the APC excluded themselves from the ballot? “Where are the children of the APC leaders preaching violence in Rivers State?” Wike called on the security agencies to perform their duties in line with the rules governing elections. He advised them to conserve their energy to fight Boko Haram and violent crime.
