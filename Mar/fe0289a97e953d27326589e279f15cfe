Gunmen have killed two motorcyclists in Badagry, Lagos, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). A source familiar with the development said in Badagry yesterday that the first killing occurred about 11p.m. on Sunday, while the second killing occurred about 6a.m. on Monday. The source said that one of the motorcyclists met his fate at Ibereko community, while the other was killed at Atanda Filling Station on Topo Road in Badagry, which is west of Lagos. “The robbers laid ambush for the okada rider at a junction in Ibereko and killed him instantly. They took away his motorcycle.
“This is the same style they used at Atanda Filling Station to kill the other okada rider. “The bodies of the cyclists have been deposited at the Badagry General Hospital,” the source said. Another source said hoodlums had been having a field day in Badagry, following the recent retirement of the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in the town. “The former DPO was able to curb crime and cultists’ activities in Badagry for more than two years. “But he retired on March 1 and within a few hours, the armed robbers have killed two persons. “We want to appeal to the new DPO to do something about crime and killing of innocent people in Badagry. “We can no longer sleep with our two eyes closed in this town since the incident occurred,” the source said.
The state Police Public Relations Officers (PPRO), CSP Chike Oti, said the command had yet to be briefed by the Badagry Police Station on the incidents.
