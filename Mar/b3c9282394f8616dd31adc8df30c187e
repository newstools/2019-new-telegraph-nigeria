A House of Representatives member-elect in Ekiti State, Hon Olusola Fatoba, has said the landslide victory recorded by President Muhammadu Buhari in the presidential polls has returned power to the grass roots level. According to him, the President’s resounding victory over the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar had confirmed that Nigerians were appreciative of the federal government’s programmes and policies. Fatoba, who won on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) added that the victory had further strengthened the power of the masses and reduced that of the elite who had been dictating the pace on who would become the president since independence. Fatoba, who was elected on February 23 to represent Ado/Irepodun/Ifelodun federal constituency, also added that the superlative performance of Governor Kayode Fayemi and women empowerment of the governor’s wife, Bisi, accounted for the APC’s good showings in Ekiti.  In a chat with journalists in Ado Ekiti yesterday, Fatoba reminded the ruling elite that Buhari had demystified their powers and brought recognition to the masses. “The victory of President Muhammadu Buhari has elevated the powers of the electorates and their relevance about who should become the president of our dear nation. “In the past, few elites dictated the pace in the politics of the nation, but now President Buhari had brought a paradigm shift to our politics and people have now taken ownership of government,” he said.
