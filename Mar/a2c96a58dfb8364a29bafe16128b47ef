Yinka Davies is an eclectic, creative, energetic entertainer with a powerful voice and vibrant personality. She’s also an actress, dancer, songwriter and reality television show judge. She was a stage performer and choreographer for many great Nigerian artistes in the 90s. She speaks with VANESSA OKWARA and ABIOLA ALABA PETERS on her over three decades sojourn in creative arts, motherhood and marriage  You have been in the entertainment industry for over three decades. What is your staying power? I can never take the glory for remaining relevant in this entertainment industry. God must be glorified all the way for keeping me steady in this business.  How would you describe growing up? Well, growing up for me was an adventurous one!  Who are those that influenced you into going into entertainment? You know, I didn’t think I was going to be in entertainment, I always thought that farming, or being a fine artist, would be my main profession until I saw people moving on stage when I went to help them paint their stage in 1987 and the rest is history.  You were one of the few women in music and entertainment during your early years as an entertainer. How did it feel being the only woman standing and how were you able to handle male dominance? I wouldn’t call it dominance. I believe we were all having a great time. As a matter of fact, I never thought it was a job; I just kept getting paid for coming to contribute my quota! It took a long time for me to realise how much time had gone to stop calling it a hobby and face <img class="size-medium wp-image-195014 alignleft" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/%E2%80%93Yinka-Davies-300x162.png?resize=300%2C162&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="162" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/–Yinka-Davies.png?resize=300%2C162&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/–Yinka-Davies.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1">business squarely!  You are a stage performer and choreographer for many great Nigerian artistes. Can you mention some of them and how it was like working for these legends? It was exhilarating honestly; Sir Shina Peters was so playful when we recorded the third album together. We used to harass Mike Okri in the studios, Alex O was my first Oga, Esse Agesse was our girlfriend that just kept hiding, Blackky was too shy, Dan Maraya Jos would call me ‘Yinka Davies of Nigeria! Oh! How I miss my chance to record with him.  You are a great dancer. How did it all start and are we going to see more of that creative side in future? I sure hope so. Come Easter Monday this year, I will be 32 years in entertainment. Like I said earlier, it was all for fun. We actually went for school expedition in 1986 and on seeing the theatre, my heart raced so fast because that was the house that hosted a lot of people we have never seen before in Nigeria in 1977; I knew my life was never going to be the same again!  Your first love was actually painting and sculpting; being a musician was not a priority for you initially. What happened to that gift now? Are you doing anything in that direction? I promise you, God keeping us all alive and well, you will see something from me very soon. I won’t say more than that.  You are quite hyperactive. How do you handle so much energy? I’m so blessed with such energy that I know I’m still under tutelage on why I’m given and who it should benefit. Don’t worry, it’s not wasting, it’s still being expressed in love.  You seem to have been off the radar. What are you currently doing? Rebranding, rebuilding, restrategising, remolding, revealing.  Describe your fashion style? Anything goes for me; but that anything has got to be exquisite, oh yes!  You were selected as a judge for the reality TV show, Nigerian Idol. What did being a judge in that show tell you?  It showed me what we have deprived our people from having-training schools, tools for learning-for our people to be up and doing instead of making area boys or peddling a profession.  You also went into acting, mention some of the flicks you have featured in? For stage, it’s quite a lot; for TV it’s the just concluded ‘Battleground’.  What does motherhood mean to you? Are any of your children taking after you? Oh yes they are! Motherhood is a gift, a treasure one can’t comprehend but can have empathy for those who are. Every woman is a mother; only those who don’t wish to be would turn their backs on a crying child.  What is it like being a single mother? Unless one finds oneself in being a single mom, I don’t pray it for an enemy, to care for a child alone let alone three or four.  What is your take on love at first sight? Have you ever experienced it? Love at first sight does happen; to some it can fizzle out, to others it is till the end of their days. Oh yes, I’ve experienced love but now I know the feeling one gets from the agape; they are poles apart like heaven and earth. We all came to this world to express God differently. I hope I make you smile like I make Him chuckle.  What’s your favourite food and perfume? My favourite food is Akpu with Ogbono soup or Ofe n’sala. Also I love Amala with Ewedu and goat meat.  What’s your favourite perfume? The perfume is Burberry classic and pomegranate oil.  If given a chance, what aspect of your life would you want to do things differently?  To be focused and add business into the creative package the Lord has blessed me with so He will be proud of me the more!  Would you take a shot at marriage if it comes your way? Oh yeah!  What kind of man are you looking to get married to? He better show up and make sure he is the one or else, he’s toast!  What are the final words to your fans? Love the Lord with every single air you breathe in and love everyone deeply and sincerely.
