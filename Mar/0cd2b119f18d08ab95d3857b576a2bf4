Two truck drivers, Abu Mustapha (35) and Kareem Ogunleke (25), who allegedly absconded with their employer’s Mack truck, were yesterday arraigned before an Ikeja Chief Magistrate’s Court. The defendants, who are both residents of Araromi Street, Papa, Ewekoro in Ogun, are facing a three-count charge of conspiracy, stealing and breach of peace. The prosecutor, Sergeant Michael Unah, said the defendants allegedly ran away with the truck of Mr. Frank Okeke, after they were deployed to Apapa for a local operation. Unah, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), told the court that the defendants commit-ted the offences on February 6 at 2p.m. at Casso Bus Stop, Alagbado, Lagos. He said the accused conducted themselves in a manner likely to cause a breach of peace by constituting nuisance and fomenting trouble after they diverted the truck with registration number KJA 543 XF to an unknown destination. The Chief Magistrate, Mr. A. A. Fashola, granted the defendants N200,000 bail with two responsible sureties in like sum. Fashola said the sureties must be gainfully employed with an evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State government and have their addresses verified by the court.
