Researchers from the Duke Eye Center in the United States (US) have found that the density of blood vessels in the eye differs between those with Alzhiemers’ disease and those without it, saying this breakthrough research could lead to early detection of the degenerative disease. Alzheimer’s disease (AD), also referred to simply as Alzheimer’s, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and gradually worsens over time.  Alzheimer’s is the most common cause of dementia, a general term for memory loss and other cognitive abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer’s disease accounts for 60 percent to 80 percent of dementia cases.  In a person with a normal, healthy brain, blood vessels in the retina are plentiful, but the researchers revealed that for those with Alzheimer’s, the same vessels are sparse and lacking in different areas.  The technology for this detection, called an OCTA scan, used to review the eye, even picks up on the blood flow of tiny capillaries smaller than the width of half a human hair.  According to the research team, the technology like this will be key in picking up on the disease before it’s too late and even before any signs of Alzheimer’s were present at all. Although the disease more frequently takes hold as we age, taking preventive measures against it can begin long before our golden years, they noted. For starters, following some pretty triedand- true wellness habits like eating greens and getting a good night’s sleep could help.  One study even found that quality of sleep is greater than quantity for protecting the brain, making it all the more important to make sleeping soundly a priority. This correlation could mean big things for the future of Alzheimer’s diagnoses, they said and based on these findings, what was previously an unpleasant, drawn-out process could now be completed in a quick, routine eye exam.
