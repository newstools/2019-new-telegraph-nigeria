The Chairman of the Christians Association of Nigeria (CAN}, Lagos State chapter, Apostle Alex Bamgbola, has said that Nigeria has a rotten foundation. He added that the nation was in dire need of a new beginning. The CAN Chairman made the observation yesterday, at the inaugural Ministers’ Development and Networking Summits themed “Building The Builder.”  The seminar was jointly organised by Deeper Life Bible Ministries (DBLM), the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN} to fine tune pastor and keep them properly focused to the calling of God. Speaking to journalists at the Deeper life Bible Church Headquarters, venue of the event, Bambgola said: “This nation has a rotten foundation, a foundation of corruption. And so what the church is doing here today is what we have to do in politics, in business and then in all areas of human endeavour in our nation.”  He noted that Nigeria started well in 1960 when the country gained her independence from the British colonial masters but pointed out that the nation was still reaping from the faulty foundation that was sowed in the 1959 elections.  His words: “I am old enough to say this because I was part of it. It was a rotten election. So every subsequent election since that time has been rotten; and that is why we are still complaining.” He took a swipe at the nation’s leadership saying: “Look at the resources of this nation. I read it with my eyes when I was in school in America in 1970s that the United Nations indicated through research that the three developed nation by 1970 would be Brazil, Korea and Western region of Nigeria; and when they talk about western regions of Nigerian, then this was in 1954, they were talking of Nigeria.
