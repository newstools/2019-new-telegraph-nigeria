Popular Nigerian singer, Olumide Edwards Adegbulu popularly known by his stage name “Olu Maintain” has taken to his social media with a reaction to being labelled with an abusive word by a fellow colleague, Lanre Dabiri, better known as ‘Eldee’. Trouble began after Olu Maintain uploaded snippets from his performance on social media for performing his (eLDee’s) hit song ‘Big Boy’ on stage. Olu Maintain, who is currently on a music tour in the U.S. performed the said track at a show in Manhattan, New York. Just as his friends began commenting on the performance eLDee dropped the shocking comment. The rapper inferred that Olu Maintain attempted to rip him off after he featured him on the track. “This shameless nigga out on stages performing my songs like he created it. I still remember how he tried to steal the record after I put him on it, forcing me to put it out prematurely. “Nigga ran off with the unmastered draft and went to print CDs with himself as the lead artist, even his verse was written by me #Appropriation #getyourownshit Lesson to young artist Don’t ever do pity features,” he wrote. Reacting to the post, the Yahooze crooner had went on to post a throwback video on his page in which he was spotted performing the said song alongside Eldee and Banky W. He made sure to tag the handles of everyone that was in the hit single. The rancor between the them comes as a surprise as there have been no previous issues reported between the two talented musical acts.
