The food, agriculture technology and products market are expected to encounter a considerable growth from $494.9 billion in 2018 to $729.5 billion by 2023, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.1 per cent during the period. This was contained in a report by Market Research Reports Search Engine (MRRSE); an interface tailored to provide information market research. According to the study, the growth is attributed to an increase in the demand and consumption of livestock-based products and seafood, increase in consumer awareness about food safety, governments support on adoption of modern techniques and increase in demand, spiraled by an increase in population. The report added that the cold chain accounted for the significant market size in the food and agriculture technology and products market in 2018. The growth of cold chain is due to the “increased business networking relations between countries, higher demand for perishable foods through online shopping and greater flexibility for transporting perishable foods at the right time in developed countries”. It could be recalled that the United Nations had continued to fight a relentless battle to eradicate extreme hunger – particularly in the world’s poorest nations–by 2030. But it was battling against severe odds, as an estimated 800 million people still live in hunger – amidst a warning that the world needs to produce at least 50 per cent more food to feed the growing 9 billion people by 2050 – 20 years beyond the UN’s goal. Still, the World Bank predicts that climate change could cut crop yields by more than 25 per cent undermining the current attempts to fight hunger. The hunger crisis has been aggravated by widespread military conflicts – even as the Security Council, the most powerful body at the United Nations, was called upon last month to play a greater role in “breaking the link between hunger and conflict.”
