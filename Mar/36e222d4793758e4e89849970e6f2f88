Forty-one years after it was awarded and abandoned, Ekit State Government yesterday formally handed over Ado- Iyin road project to a new contractor, CCECC Nigeria Ltd for immediate work. The road which was originally awarded in 1978 was abandoned by successive governments. Handing the project over to the contractor, Governor Kayode Fayemi said he was irrevocably committed to fulfilling all his electioneering promises in all sectors, especially in the area of infrastructure, a catalyst for development. The brief ceremony signified the commencement of work on the road project billed for completion within 24 months. Fayemi, who was represented by Deputy Governor, Otunba Bisi Egbeyemi, said the 7.25km road project was the first phase of the construction work which would stop at the state’s boundary with Osun State, noting that the dualization project would be completed within 24 months. Fayemi said: “As a government, we understand and appreciate the importance of good road network to our economic development. Good road network will not only ease the stress of commuters but will also enhance the marketability of our farm produce which is the mainstay of most of our people.”
