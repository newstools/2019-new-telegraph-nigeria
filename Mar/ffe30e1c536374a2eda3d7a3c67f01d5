World heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder (40-0-1) will defend his title against mandatory challenger Dominic Breazeale (20-1) at the Barclays Center in Brookyn on May 18, but has insisted he “can’t wait” to take on Anthony Joshua (22-0) in a unification fight, who defends his world titles to Jarrell Miller on June 1 at MSG. The Wilder vs Breazeale world title fight was ordered by the WBC, after Briton Tyson Fury opted for an alternative bout instead of a rematch with Wilder, 33. Breazeale, also 33, has lost just one of his 21 fights – to IBF, WBO and WBA champion Anthony Joshua in 2016, who is still the main target for ‘The Bronze Bomber’. “I hold the keys in the division,” said Wilder. “I will knock this fool out.” Wilder became increasingly intense at a news conference to announce the bout, making reference to an altercation with Breazeale at an Alabama hotel in February 2017 and once more threatening to kill his opponent in the ring with references to funerals, causing dislike amongst fight fans.
