The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the suspension of the collation of last Saturday’s gubernatorial election results in Rivers state by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was not acceptable to it. The party in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan alleged that it was a premeditated plan by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government to use INEC and security agencies to truncate the wishes of the Rivers people as already delivered at the polling units. “Our party contends that elections have been concluded in Rivers State; results of the governorship and House of Assembly polls have been declared at the various polling units, wards and local government collation centers and all returning officers and political parties in the ballot conclusively have the figures. “It is therefore directly incumbent on INEC to declare the final results instead of deliberately creating openings for the subversion of the final process; a development, which exposes the commission’s complicity with the Buhari presidency and the APC to enmesh the election into unnecessary crisis,” the PDP said. It noted that many innocent Nigerians have been killed in an attempt to forcefully take over Rivers State, and advised INEC to save the state from further bloodletting by immediately declaring the results. “Furthermore, the PDP calls on President Muhammadu Buhari to reflect on the bloodlettings that have characterized this election, which many Nigerians believe, would have been averted if he had signed the Amendment to the Electoral Act. “Mr. President should immediately call the security agencies (who have been annexed as departments of the APC) to end their siege to our electoral process. Any further delay is a recipe for escalation of crisis in our nation,” the party further warned.
