Bayern Munich head coach Niko Kovac admits the Champions League visit of Liverpool is a personal highlight for him but knows nothing other than a victory will suffice. The former Croatia international adopted a deferential tone, not what you usually expect from the manager of five-time European champions and a team which has a record 28 Bundesliga titles, when talking about their last-16, second-leg opponents. ‘I’ve qualified for the World Cup and led Eintracht Frankfurt in the relegation play-off – that was the worst – but tomorrow is a highlight,’ Kovac told a press conference. ‘The world will be watching us. Everyone’s excited: the players, the coaches, the fans and the media. ‘It’s a tough game and the pressure is always on in knockout games but that’s a positive, not a negative.’
A goalless draw at Anfield leaves this match finely-balanced as an away goal for Liverpool would significantly tilt the game in their favour.  However, the onus will be on Bayern, in their own stadium, to come up with a more attacking game plan than the containment approach they adopted three weeks ago. The German club did not manage a shot on target for the first time since their semi-final, first-leg tie at Barcelona in 2015 and Kovac accepts that is the one area which has to improve.
