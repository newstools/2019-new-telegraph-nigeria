Governor Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos State, who visited the scene of the collapsed three-storey building, blamed landlords for the incident, promising to offset the bill of the victims. He said: “Many of the houses had been tested and recommended to be demolished, but landlords are not cooperating with us. “I’m appealing to the residents and landlords to cooperate with the government officials and allow them do their jobs.” Ambode commiserated with families of victims who lost their lives, most of whom were children. The governor, who got to the scene about 2.42p.m., described the incident as unfortunate. He appealed to residents to allow rescue operators the space to carry out their operations without hindrance, so as to rescue more children. He said: “I want to commiserate with families of those that lost their lives in this collapsed building. I want to quickly let Lagosians know that this is quite an unfortunate incident. All we are trying to do is to scale up this rescue operation. Our response units are already here; we are getting additional cranes to be able to go deeper than where we are now to rescue more lives. “I just want to appeal to people that when we are doing this kind of rescue operation, yes, sympathisers will naturally come but I want to appeal that they should give the rescue workers the chance to save more lives.” The governor said his Deputy, Dr. Oluranti Adebule, also visited hospitals where some of the rescued victims had been taken to, promising that government would take over their treatment and foot the entire bill. Ambode said he had received information that the building was a residential one, with the school operating illegally on the premises, adding that about two floors of the building sunk to the ground.
