Two-time commonwealth champion, Odunayo Adekuoroye, is now ranked 4th in the women’s -57kg wrestling class after her performances at last month’s German Grand Prix and Bulgarian Open. According to the rankings released by United World Wrestling during the weekend, China’s Ningning Rong is topping the women’s -57kg; Bilyana Dudova of Bulgaria is second while Grace Bullen of Norway is third. The German Prix champion told our correspondent that she was excited returning to the top-ranked wrestlers in the world. She attributed the ranking to the support of the President of Nigeria Wrestling Federation, Daniel Igali, her coach, Purity Akuh, training partners and her pastor, Daniel Olukoya. The four times African champion said, “I am happy that finally I have been ranked fourth in the world after my performances at the German Prix and Bulgarian Open. I want to thank everyone including our president, my coach and Pastor Olukoya, for their support whenever I have tournaments to attend.” She revealed in a chat with our correspondent that her target was to be ranked number one by the end of the year. Adekuoroye said, “If you recall than in 2017, I was ranked number one in the world after performing excellently well in my outings and by the grace of God, hopefully before the end of 2019, I will get to the top again.” Sharing her experiences at the German Grand Prix and Bulgarian Open, Adekuoroye said: “I learnt so many lessons from these two tournaments; what I am good at and my weaknesses and most importantly the mistakes of my opponents.”
