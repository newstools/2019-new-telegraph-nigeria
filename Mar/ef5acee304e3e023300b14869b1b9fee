Gunmen suspected to herdsmen of Fulani extraction have killed at least 10 people at Tse-Uorayev community, Ukpaim village in Guma Local Government Area of Benue State.
Witnesses said the attackers invaded the village in the night on Tuesday and killed the people. The killing came a few days to the rescheduled governorship rerun election. “The incident occurred in the night as the people were sleeping outside the house because of the heat when the gunmen came to the community. “The gunmen shot at the people and immediately ran away, so no one can identify those responsible for the killing,” the locals said. The Chairman of Guma Local Government, Anthony Shawon, said a community was attacked in his council area late hours of Tuesday and 10 people were killed.
He said: “A day before Tuesday, someone had been killed by herdsmen before the incident at Tser-Uorayev. “It is the same herdsmen that went to this community on Tuesday night and killed 10 people who were sleeping outside. “The corpses are being buried as I am talking to you now. This is because the villagers said that they should bring the corpses for burial.”
The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPR), DSP Catherine Anene, confirmed that attack. She said: “The Divisional Police Officer in Guma just confirmed the incident. He said that he found five corpses at the time he got to the burial site.
“Members of the community stated that they had buried some persons before the arrival of the police.” The Force Commander, Operation Whirl Stroke, Major General Adeyemi Yekini, said investigation was ongoing on the attack on Guma community.
