A witness said the pupils of Ohen Nursery and Primary School had prayed and sung all the rhymes, rendition and other exercises in the morning when the world suddenly turned dark for them. He said: “The school is close to our building. They had already settled for the class work, when all of a sudden, we heard a loud noise and the entire environment became dusty. “The visibility was zero. Our 92-year-old mum was also affected. Part of the collapsed building fell on Mama. She had also been rushed to the hospital.”
