Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Loans, Aids and Debt Management, Hon. Ahmed Dayyabu Safana, has called on the Federal Government to save his constituents and the state from armed bandits, kidnappers and cattle rustlers. Safana, who represents Safana/Batsari/Danmusa federal constituency of Kastina State, made the call in a press statement yesterday in Abuja. The lawmaker lamented that his constituency has been taken over by armed bandits “who constantly harass our people, kidnap our men, women and children for ransom; and are gradually turning the constituency and the entire state into a theatre of war” He disclosed that just two days ago, five persons were killed at Kasai village in Batsari Local Government Area; in addition to daily killings and kidnappings that have become an unrestrained occurrence. “I am actually very disturbed that people are innocently displaced from their homeland without any meaningful intervention from the appropriate authorities. “It is pertinent to mention that Alhazawa village in Safana Local Government Area has been displaced. In the real sense, my constituents are in a very terrible and precarious situation to the extent that even their representatives find it difficult to visit them when the need arises”
