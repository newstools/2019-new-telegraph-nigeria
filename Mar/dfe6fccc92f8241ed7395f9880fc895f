  I mo State Governor Rochas Okorocha has reacted to the suspension slammed on him by the National Working Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC), describing it as a plot to destroy the APC in the South-East. He blamed the National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole, for his plight, saying the national chairman was determined right from the outset to destroy APC in the South-East unknown to party chieftains from the zone who had genuinely supported his emergence. A statement issued by Okorocha’s spokesman, Mr. Sam Onwuemeodo, reads in part: “Oshiomhole is playing the politics of 2023 in 2019 and in playing it, he has thrown caution to the wind. In all the South-East states there are crises and all arising from the fraudulent manner he conducted the primaries. “In 2015, Okorocha had joined the merger that gave birth to APC at the risk of his second tenure and was called all sorts of unprintable names. Yet, he won the governorship election, delivered 24 out of the 27 members of the House of Assembly for APC, two House of Representatives members and one Senator. “In 2019, Oshiomhole felt that such a man should be treated with disdain. He handed over the governorship ticket of the Party to Hope Uzodinma who never resigned his membership of the PDP on the floor of the Senate like others did, giving all kinds of flimsy excuses. “If Oshiomhole had meant well for APC and Imo people in particular, wouldhe have given the ticket of the party to a man facing five corruption charges and travel ban to be the party’s Candidate. “And when the APC members across the nation are still celebrating the success of the party in the Presidential and National Assembly elections, Oshiomhole in his wisdom or lack of it, felt that the best action in the circumstance was to suspend two governors who did well in the election, even when he played safe in 2015 and 2019 in Edo State without any known pressure.”
