Men of the Lagos State Police Command have arrested three suspected thieves for allegedly burgling a store at Owen Street, Jibowu.
The suspects, Paul Ozurumba, Stanley Sungalome and Michael Agbunwor, were arrested on February 19.
The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Chike Oti, said: “The policemen sighted the hoodlums in front of the store with their operational vehicle. The vehicle is a space wagon, with registration number PG 393 AAA. The suspects, on seeing the approaching police team, sped off, driving against traffic in their desperation to evade arrest. They were given a hot chase by the police. However, the occupants of the bus opened fire at the police team, forcing the policemen to retaliate. The bus abruptly halted and fell into a ditch. Some of the robbers escaped with bullet wounds, leaving behind their member, who sustained gunshot injury. The suspect was found with three big sacks containing different sizes of shoes, bags, clothes and other items.
During interrogation, he gave his name as Paul Ozurumba. A search warrant was executed in his house and the following items, ranging from refrigerator, pharmaceutical drugs, bale of underwear, televisions and other property suspected to have been stolen, were recovered from him. The suspect led the police to arrest two other members of his gang, Stanley Sungalome and Michael Agbunwor.”
