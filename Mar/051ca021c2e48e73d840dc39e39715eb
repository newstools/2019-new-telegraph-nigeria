That will be a thankful process,” Mr Danie said. He added further; “I will continue to support the political process in a non partisan manner. I am clear with my position, without any ambiguity. There is no need to insinuate, speculate, extrapolate, anticipate or draw conclusions on my behalf. :I did not expect such a simple personal decision can generate such national discourse and for that I remain grateful to God. “I am however most grateful to all my friends and well wishers. The phones have not stopped ringing. All the advice are well taken. My very deep appreciation.” Atiku or the leadership of the PDP is yet to comment on Mr Daniel’s resignation from the party and politics.
