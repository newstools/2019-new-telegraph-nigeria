Following the controversy that trailed the 2019 general elections in many states, which has led to inconclusive polls in some states, the Conference of Nigeria Political Parties (CNPP) has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the judiciary to frustrate efforts of desperate politicians and ensure that the will of the people prevails in states where the governorship polls result is yet to be declared.
CNPP in a statement signed by its Secretary General, Chief Willy Ezugwu, urged “the judiciary to live up to its responsibility of ensuring stability at a time of electoral chaos deliberately orchestrated politicians in their greed for power for the purpose of selfish allocation of the people’s commonwealth.”
It also frowned at what it described as “a disappointing decimation of principles of democratic elections” after the 2019 general elections.
The statement reads in part: “Today, the outcome of some state governorship elections is yet to be known weeks after the polls due to the manipulative efforts by some unpatriotic politicians who want to upturn the sovereign will of the Nigerian people at any cost.
“We therefore call on INEC and the Judiciary to frustrate efforts of desperate politicians and ensure that the will of the people prevails in states where the governorship polls result is yet to be declared.
“Nigeria cannot continue on the path of fraudulent elections. It is the duty of the judiciary, where the electoral umpire has failed, to punish beneficiaries of manipulated electoral outcomes to serve as deterrence to dishonest politicians and eliminate electoral violence and end this circles of dishonesty by political elite to enable the country to develop.
“We strongly believe that flawed elections promote corruption and underdevelopment, which Nigeria is a typical example.”
CNPP while seeking for the conclusion of the gubernatorial election in Rivers State, urged “INEC and all stakeholders in Rivers State to ensure that the governorship election in the state is concluded on May 2, 2019 without tampering with the will of the people through the ballot.”
