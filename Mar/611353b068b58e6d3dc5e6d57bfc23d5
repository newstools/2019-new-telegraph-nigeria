The Coalition of Delta APC support Groups has called on the National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to probe the 2019 governorship candidate of the party in the state, Chief Great Ogboru, for mismanaging the chance to unseat Governor Ifeanyi Okowa. The coalition, which is the umbrella body of the South-South zone support groups, including the Buhari Support Group (BSO) and the Niger Delta Consolidated Forum (NDCF) for President Muhammadu Buhari’s re-election, said they are saddened that Ogboru’s in-fighting gave Okowa the upper hand in the contest. They said it was the political misadventure, selfserving and open hostility of Ogboru after he defected with Senator Ovie Omo- Agege from Labour Party (LP) to hijack the party structure and the destructive decision of the National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, that made APC to record failure. The Coordinator of the coalition, Prince Daniel Ekiugbo, supported by the his counterpart in NDCF, Peter Edo, a.k.a Fireman, and the President of Nollywood in the Niger Delta, Dr. Jonathan Ganagana, in Asaba yesterday said Ogboru suffered woeful defeat because he mismanaged the N3 billion he received from the party’s high command to prosecute the election. He said: “We consider it a notorious fraud for Great Ogboru to waste the 2019 APC gubernatorial ticket in such questionable and shameful circumstances where the party won a paltry local government areas, out of 25, with an alarming figure of 215,938 against PDP’s 925,274.”
