The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday declared the results of 21 of the 24 seats in Bayelsa State House of Assembly election. Head, INEC Department of Voter Education and Publicity, Mr. Wilfred Ifogah, announced that the Commission would conduct a supplementary election in the three constituencies where election was declared inconclusive.  Ifogah listed the three constituencies as Ogbia Constituency II, Brass Constituency I and Southern- Ijaw Constituency IV. He disclosed that out of the 21 seats declared so far, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) won 17 seats while the All Progressives Congress (APC) won only four seats, explaining that the election in the three constituencies was declared inconclusive by the commission due to the failure of the party supporters to adhere to the INEC regulations and guidelines for the conduct of the general elections.  He said: “The results of 21 results constituencies have been fully declared and winners have been returned, while election in three constituencies was declared inconclusive.”
