Live theatre, and indeed arts and culture, enthusiasts in Lagos, are in for thrilling theatrical performance as Hertitude, a play written and directed by Kesiena C. Obue, goes on stage. Produced by Kessavier Vanille Productions, and starring Maryann Ivy as Rume, Martha Ehinome Orhiere as Ogor, Uche Chika Elumelu as Kesiena, the play goes on stage March 30 to April 1, at Freedom Park, Broad Street, Lagos. Set in a private night club, Hertitude is about three sisters who reunite after their single mother suffers a debilitating heart attack. In the course of this reunion they find themselves struggling to deal with despair, betrayal, loneliness and failure, as past resentments, their individual demons, the pressures of society’s arbitrary formulations of womanhood and social media fakery emerge. All of these will be laid bare with drama, dance, music and sass. With Hertitude we get to see that we never inherently posses the morals we portray to have. They meet at a club run by Rume (Maryann Ivy), a pimp who laments the emotional and mental abuse she suffered in the hands of her mother. The two other sisters are Kesiena (Uche Elumelu), an intelligent wom-an with a first-class science degree who lives as a kept woman for her high society billionaire husband and Ogor (Martha Ehinome Orhiere), a Nollywood actress with a seemingly perfect work and marital life. Obue, who has a Bachelor’s degree in Microbiology from the University of Port Harcourt, a diploma in creative writing and a Post Graduate degree in Theatre Arts from the University of Ibadan, said: “Hertitude is an entertaining, educative and refreshingly candid work of art is a paradigm shift that seeks to vibrantly entertain, whilst also triggering a new determination for us to collectively and actively participate in the intelligent discourse that we need to move our society forward.”
