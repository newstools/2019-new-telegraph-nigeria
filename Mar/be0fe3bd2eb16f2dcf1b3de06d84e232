 The final week of the 2019 GTBank Lagos Polo International Tournament galloped off on a scintillating note Wednesday at the Lagos Polo Club with Kaduna Homes Group defeating Port Harcourt Wilton Aviation 7-2 in the Low Cup. Kano Ibah.also got off to a winning start in the Low Cup with a 5 – 4 1/2 win over STL Wayland to stay on course for the semifinals slot. In the first game of the day which had five matches on the schedule, Kabiru Saidu got the opening goal for Kaduna Homesgroup.who are completed by Nasiru Yusuf, Rabiu Mohammed and Aliyu Tijani. Wilton Aviation, formed by Peter Webb, Nura Suleiman, Kayode Noah and Segun Sotomi, managed to keep the score level through their English five-goaler Webb via a long low shot but the European soon after fluffed a 60-yard penalty which would have seen them ahead going into the second chukka. Mohammad restored Home Group’s lead with a 30-yarder and Tijani stretched their advantage finishing off a two-mam move with a tap in from six yards. Tijani was denied another goal by Webb’s tailshot clearance but it came to futility as a 10-yard shot for infringement was converted by Tijani for a 4-1 lead which proved unassailable. The second match was a bit more competitive as home side STL Wayland battled Kano IIbah with both teams breathing down each other’s neck for most part of the encounter. STL, who are formed by Lolu Agoro, Tata Ali, Ibrahim Dantala and Abdulrahmam Mohammed, had a 1 1/2 goal advantage for their handicap inferiority and were 3 1/2 – 1 up with Dantala and Abdulrahman getting early goals but the oil and gas team from the Pyramid City turned it around in the third and fourth chukka with Halifa Ibrahim and Murtala Aliyu masterminding a great turnaround with support from Ibrahim Halliru and Lado Ibrahim.  Five matches are also on the list for Thursday with the Makek Cup clash between Lagos Centaurs and STL the eagerly anticipated fixture of the day..
