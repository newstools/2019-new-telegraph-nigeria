The final of this year’s edition of the Delta State Principals’ Cup has been fixed for April 1 and venue is the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba. Incidentally, this venue has hosted international matches in recent time. The Super Eagles defeated Seychelles 3-1on Friday at the arena and today, the U-23 team will tackle Libya in an AFCON qualifier second led tie. Also tomorrow, the Super Eagle will clash with the Pharaohs in an international friendly encounter. No doubt, the people of Delta will continue with this football feast on Monday next week when the final of the youth football competition sponsored by Zenith Bank takes centre stage. Governor Ifeanyi Okowa who entered into a partnership agreement with the sponsors three years ago to revive the competition which was in limbo for 27 years, has confirmed that he will be present for the final. The governor was present at the final of the first and second edition of the tournament and the young ones will also be glad to have him around this term. Commissioner for Basic and Secondary Education, Chiedu Ebie, confirmed at the weekend that Governor Okowa would be at the final. The organisers led by Tony Pemu are excited as all the four finalists that will compete for honours on the final day. Pemu said all arrangements have been concluded to make the April 1 date grand for all participants. “We are all happy that the date is here and the schools are ready to excite us with their talents,” Pemu said. Only last week, Group Managing Director of Zenith Bank, Peter Amangbo, stated that plans were in place to make this year’s final better than the previous ones. He commended the finalists of the competition which involved hundreds of private and public secondary schools in the state.
