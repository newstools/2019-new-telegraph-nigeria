An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court yesterday remanded a 37-year-old driver, Olabode Fakorode, in prison for allegedly robbing a man of an unregistered Camry car, valued at N1.8 million at gunpoint.
The Chief Magistrate, Mr. A. A. Fashola, remanded Fakorode in Kirikiri Prisons, pending advice from the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Fashola, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), ruled that the copy of the file should be sent to the DPP and adjourned the case till April 22. The defendant, who resides at Gbobe in Benin Republic, is facing a two-count charge, bordering on robbery but he pleaded not guilty to the charges. Earlier, the prosecutor, Sergeant Michael Unah, said the defendant robbed Olusola Adeboga of his Toyota Camry, valued at N1.8 million at gunpoint. Unah told the court that the defendant, with two others still at large, committed the offences on January 5 about 9.45p.m. at Morogbo on the Lagos-Badagry Expressway.
The prosecutor said the defendant and the others, disguised as policemen, stopped the complainant at a checkpoint. He said: “The defendant snatched the complainant’s car, valued at N1.8 million at gunpoint. The complainant tracked his car and alerted the policemen at the area.
“The defendant was apprehended by the police while the two accomplices ran away.”
The offences contravene Sections 299 and 297 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015.
Both sections attract 21 years jail term for offenders.
