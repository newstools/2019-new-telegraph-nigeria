Fire has destroyed the Egbeme Gas Processing Plant at Ebediei in Ukwuani Local Government Area of Delta State and rendered over 50 workers redundant.
This came barely 30 days after the Group Managing Director (GMD) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Dr. Maikanti Baru, inaugurated the firm.
Since its commission on February 7, 2019, gas exploration, business activities and job opportunities sprang up in the community.
The fire, which was said to have started about 6p.m. on Monday, gutted the plant and damaged property worth millions of naira.
It took the combined efforts of men of the state Fire Service from Abraka and Eku in Ethiope East Local Government Area before the inferno was put out.
The general manager of the firm could not be reached to ascertain the cause of the fire.
An indigene of the area, Sunday Enebeli, however, attributed the cause of the fire to negligence.
He said: “We suddenly saw the fire. Within seconds, the fire had engulfed the gas plant. There was panic among residents of the area. Before fire service men arrived, the fire had done a huge damage to the facilities.”
Enebeli said no death was recorded but that two of the workers sustained injuries.
