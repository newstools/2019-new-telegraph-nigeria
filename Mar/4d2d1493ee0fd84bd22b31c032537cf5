Twenty-six governorship candidates of various parties in Ebonyi State, yesterday announced that they were stepping down for Governor Dave Umahi. Also, two All Progressive Congress’ (APC) State House of Assembly candidates announced that they were stepping down for the PDP candidates in the Saturday’s governorship and the State Assembly elections.  They announced this at the State Executive Council Chambers of Government House Abakaliki, the state capital. Mr. Okorie Ogbonnaya of the Advanced Allied Party (AAP), who spoke on behalf of the governorship candidates, said that their decision was to allow for continuity on the already achieved development of making the state the envy of other states.  They said: “After critically appraising the developmental stride of Governor Umahi and in perfect agreement that he has done well in his first term and will do more in second term, we the underlisted political parties hereby resolve without any form of force to step down for Governor David Umahi and adopt him as our sole candidate for the governorship election.  “But we shall fight for justice and stand by the people of the State in the case of obvious alleged planned manipulation of the election by the All Progressive Congress, APC.”
