Clearing agents operating at the Western Zone â€“ Apapa and Tin-Can Island -have issued a 72 hour-ultimatum to the Comptroller General of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Col Hameed Ali, over duplication of clearance processes at the seaports. The Association of Nigeria Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA), National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders (NAGAFF) and National Council of Managing Directors of Licensed Customs Agents (NCMDLCA) jointly said that the seaports in Lagos would be shut down on Monday if the multiple check points were not addressed. It was learnt that the latest development which spiked tension in the port was the recent deployment of a special team from Abuja to inspect third party cargoes at the port. At a press briefing held in Apapa yesterday, they noted that the Customs boss had allegedly deployed a team from Abuja to checkmate activities of the various commands at the western zone.
