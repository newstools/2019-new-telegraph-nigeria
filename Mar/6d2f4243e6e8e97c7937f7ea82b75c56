 Three young girls were rescued after operatives of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) and the police stormed a hotel in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. According to the NAPTIP Head, Press and Public Relations Unit, Victoria Selwor Ijampy, the operatives raided a hotel used as hideout for suspected human traffickers. The hotel is also alleged to be used for the sexual exploitation of young women.
“The facility, which is well known, is located at Tudunwada Lugbe, FCT, Abuja. During the operation, three victims were rescued, while three suspects were arrested. “The raid followed an intelligence report about the place being used for underage and exploitive prostitution and other vices. Some of the girls have been living in the brothel for over a year and some less than three months,” Ijampy said. She added that the hotel was sealed off in accordance with Sections 43 and 52 of the trafficking in persons (prohibition) enforcement and administration act, 2015 which authorises NAPTIP to enter, search and seal up properties suspected to be used for human trafficking purposes. The NAPTIP Director-General, Dame Julie Okah-Donli, frowned at brothels using under-age girls for prostitution, and warned that those involved in such acts would be dealt with according to the law.
She also applauded the officers for the smooth operation and collaborative efforts of the police in carrying out the raid.
Okah-Donli said that the suspects would soon be charged to court.
