Former Super Eagles goalkeeper, Dosu Joseph, has charged players invited to camp in preparation for Africa Cup of Nations Cup to ensure they take their chance and prove themselves worthy as the countdown continues towards the tournament in Egypt. Dosu has supported the team’s Manager Gernot Rohr in recent times, saying he has what it takes to do the country proud at the AFCON finals. “The team is good enough to go up against the very big sides on the continent if the best legs are paraded at the championship,” the ex Julius Berger goalie said. Super Eagles will retur n to the Africa Cup of Nations next year after missing out on the last two editions and Dosu believes the team will be one of the favourites. The 1996 Olympic gold medallist called on the players invited to ensure they prove themselves as many players are doing their best in their respective club sides but have not been given the chance for a call up despite doing well on a weekly basis. “We are all looking for opportunities to represent our country, and when you have it, all you need to do is to grab it and move forward with it,” he said. “A lot of them out there yet to be invited to the national team are also looking forward to that opportunity”. “I will surely advise that any player who has been called up to make good use of the opportunity to make themselves proud,” he said. The likes of Egypt, Senegal, Morocco, and Cameroon are among teams considered to be ahead in the race for the continental crown next year
