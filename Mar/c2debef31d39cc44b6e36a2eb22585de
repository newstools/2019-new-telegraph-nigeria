They were each convicted of one-court charge bordering on impersonation and sending of pornographic and indecent pictures. The trio of Adegbola, Babarinde and Sokoya were tried by Hon. Justice Watilat Ibrahim of the Federal High Court 2, Abeokuta, Ogun State, who found them guilty of their individual offences, convicted and sentenced them to prison. But Mufutauâ€™s conviction was pronounced by Hon. Justice S. M. Abubakar of the Federal High Court 1, Abeokuta, Ogun State. The judge held that the prosecution proved the case against him beyond every reasonable doubt. The first, second and third convicts were initially arraigned on December 10, 2018, while the fourth convict was arraigned on December 11, 2018.
