There was palpable tension in the southern part of Kaduna metropolis yesterday following reports of killings and attacks in neighbouring Kajuru Local Government Area of the state.  Our correspondent gathered that no fewer than 100 people were killed and more than 100 houses razed by gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen in mainly Christian villages of Kajuru. The killings took place on Sunday and Monday, with unconfirmed reports that another attack took place on Tuesday night.  Worried by reports filtering from Kajuru villages by those who survived the attacks, the state government had declared a duskto- dawn curfew on Kajuru and some parts of Chikun Local Government Area, a suburb of Kaduna metropolis.  A statement entitled; “Kaduna State Government imposes dusk-todawn curfew in Kajuru LGA, parts of Chikun LGA” and signed by Governor Nasir el-Rufai’s spokesman, Samuel Aruwan said: “Security assessments have necessitated the imposition of a dusk-to-dawn curfew in all parts of Kajuru Local Government Area, effective from today, Wednesday, 13th March 2019.  The dusk-to-dawn curfew is also extended to Kujama and Maraban Rido, which are in Chikun Local Government.” The statement added that; “The curfew in the affected areas will be in effect from 6p.m. to 6a.m. daily, until further notice.  “Security agencies have been directed to ensure strict enforcement of the curfew. The Kaduna State Government appeals to all residents and communities in the affected areas to bear the inconvenience of the curfew and cooperate with the security agencies.” Aruwan said.
