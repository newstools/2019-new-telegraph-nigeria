The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has vowed to sustain its ongoing fight to stop illegal developers who have continued to embark on the construction of unapproved structures in contravention of development rules and master plan of Abuja. Director, Department of Development Control, (FCT ) Muktar Galadima, who gave the warning while on an inspection tour of some building sites, frowned at the desperation with which some estate developers were raising new structures and modifying existing ones. He said the law on development will be applied appropriately to sanction those that were found culpable. Galadima, who inspected an ongoing building modifications project at Wuse 2 Area of the territory, warned developers to desist from flagrant abuses of development rules, as such actions would attract loses to them. He said that the Department of Development would not hesitate to demolish any building, whether new ones or modification projects that lack approval from the relevant authorities. He emphasised the need for all developers to comply with the current integrity test exercise which the FCT administration has directed all developers to carry out, especially on buildings that have been abandoned for a long time. “Any developer that must do any modification on any building must apply for approval. Otherwise, we shall remove any structure that lacks relevant approval. “As for this building we came to remove because of the modification which the developer is doing, we have just been informed that the developer has submitted application for modification. “We have therefore decided to subject the building to integrity test, to determine if the structure can accommodate the planned changes”, he noted.
