Super Eagles defender, William Troost-Ekong, has lamented the inability of the national team to match up their first half performance in the second half of games. It is becoming a regular situation for the Eagles to play very well in the first half of games while sitting back in the second half allowing their opponents to come at them. Speaking after the team’s 1-0 defeat of Egypt in an international friendly game on Tuesday, the Udinese of Italy defender said they had to find a solution to their second half performance to compete favourably well with other big countries. “For me, we have to start improving on our second half performance because teams will start coming at us,” he said. “We have to see how we can play our game with more calmness. It is expected for opponents to want to score goal especially while losing, but we have to match them toe-to-toe if truly we want to compete.”
