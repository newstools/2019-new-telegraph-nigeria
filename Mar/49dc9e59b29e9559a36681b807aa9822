The presidency on yesterday said that at least 30,000 Nigerians have benefited from the implementation of the TraderMoni since the conclusion of the February 23 presidential election. Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo stated this yesterday through a statement by his media office in reaction to speculations that the TraderMoni scheme and other GEEP micro-credit products (MarketMoni and FarmerMoni) – a component of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration’s Social Investment Programme may have been abandoned. Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to the Vice President, Laolu Akande, while giving an update report on the GEEP micro-credit products (TraderMoni, MarketMoni, and FarmerMoni) said: “So far, a target of 30,000 minimum beneficiaries per state has been achieved in majority of the 36 states and FCT since after the national and state polls.” He explained that, “what the implementing agency has been doing since the last phase of disbursements is generating the balance of program funding while ramping up on the states with shortages. “Consequently, disbursements have continued to happen in the states; for instance, we have had over 28,000 disbursements across 10 states since after the elections. Our priority is ramping up these numbers in the balance of states before we move to phase two of the program after detailed reviews and structural enhancements for larger scale.
