 A 29-year-old dismissed soldier, Corporal Shedrack Christopher, has been arrested for allegedly stealing two phones in the hotel where he lodged. Christopher allegedly stole two Infinix Hot 4 handsets valued at N86,000 from Express View Hotel, located at the Ketu, Ijanikin area of Lagos. The suspect, who bears Shedrack Christopher in his Army identify card, bears Kenneth Chikwe in his driver’s licence. The suspect, however, denied, stealing the phones, which were found in his possession. He told the police that he picked the phones. He explained that after he found the phones, he left instruction with some of the hotel staff that anyone whose phone was missing should get in touch with him. The dismissed soldier, who joined the Nigerian Army in November 2013, and left in 2018, said that his intention was never to steal the phones. Asked why he had a cutlass, an axe and a knife in his possession, he replied: “I do carry bags of rice for traders on Badagry Expressway with my car. And bad boys used to disturb me. I need to defend myself. In fact, I got the weapons to protect myself.” The state Commissioner of Police, Zubairu Muazu, said that on March 3, Ijanikin Police Station received a complaint from Express View Hotel, Ketu, Ijanikin, that a lodger, identified as Christopher, who claimed to be a soldier, stole two Infinix Hot 4 handsets valued at N86,000 from the bar and hotel room. When his room was searched, the items were recovered, including axe, cutlass, knife and a Nigerian Army warrant card.
Muazu said: “A Honda Accord car with registration number Lagos SMK 846 and an Army uniform were recovered from him. The suspect confessed to have deserted from the Nigerian Army in 2017. He participated in the killing at Igando, Lagos and Edo states in 2017 after deserting the Army.”
