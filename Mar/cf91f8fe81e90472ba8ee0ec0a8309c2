 Super Eagles Manager, Gernot Rohr, has again charged Kelechi Iheanacho to show more attitude if he is to make the Super Eagles squad to the fastapproaching Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. The Leicester City forward was omitted from Nigeria’s matches against Seychelles and Egypt, and amid rumours of him losing out his place in the team; the German gaffer pointed out that Iheanacho must make use of the opportunity of being a left footed striker which is rare in his team. “We don’t have a striker with a left foot, it will be interesting with Kelechi fighting and showing a professional attitude,” he said Rohr while basking in the euphoria of Nigeria’s unbeaten run since the 3-2 defeat by Argentina at the 2018 World Cup expressed delight with the striking force of the Super Eagles. He declared: “We now have three good strikers; also we have Kelechi with a left foot.” According to the 65-year-old coach, Iheanacho, who once played for Man City alongside the trio of Odion Ighalo, Paul Onuachu and Victor Osimhen will be Nigeria’s strik-ers at the 24-team championship holdijg from June 21 to July 19 in the North African country. Osimhen showed his class by grabbing a hattrick in Nigeria’s U-23 team’s 4-0 whitewash of Libya in a second leg of the Olympics qualifier in Asaba and Rohr is excited with his great form. “On (the) strikers, we are very happy with what Osimhen did against Libya. He was supposed to play with us against Egypt on Tuesday, to come in at least but he played on Monday against Libya so he was not in the game. No injury. “For Ighalo, his ankle is getting better and he was ready to help at the end of the match against Egypt.”
