Kristianstads DFF of Sweden midfielder, Rita Chikwelu, has disclosed that she deeply cherished being able to captain Nigeria’s female soccer team, Super Falcons, to victory on the same day she clocked 31 years on earth. The Falcons’ captain was again in top form on Wednesday, as she led the squad to a stunning 3-0 spanking of Thailand at the Cyprus International Women’s Cup. Although she could not get on the scorers’ card as she had done with a brace in their 4-3 win against Slovakia, Chikwelu was excited that the African champions claimed a crucial win that helped them finish seventh overall at the Cyprus Cup. Chikwelu, who was Falcons’ alternate captain with Onome Ebi en route to winning the 2018 Africa Women Cup of Nations in Ghana, was thrilled with lavish celebrations that followed Wednesday’s win, as her colleagues and officials added gaiety to mark her birthday in style. Chikwelu was given a baptism of water by her teammates, who chased the former Umeå IK of Sweden round on a beach and she was soaked to the skin in an exciting display of camaraderie among all the players.
