A mob in the early hours of yesterday burnt to death a suspected cultist caught dismembering the body of a lady he had murdered. The incident occurred at the Akempai area of Yenagoa, Bayelsa State. It was learnt that he was caught while trying to cut open the body of the young lady identified as Best, an indigene of Epie, when luck ran out on him. He was apprehended by the mob. Witnesses said the people were angry that the man challenged them with the axe which he used to kill the lady. A community source said the man, who was well known in the community, behaved like a mad man in the day time but had been killing people at night, especially women. The source said Best was his latest victim as three other ladies had lost their lives in the same circumstances in the last one month. “That is the guy that has been killing women at Akenfa. They caught him once when he was trying to kill another woman; I think that was last month. They beat him up but did not hand him over to the police. “He was still saying he will kill. This morning he killed one Epie girl. The people caught him when he was trying to butcher her with an axe. This was the third woman he had killed so far,” the source said. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Asinim Butswat, said both the suspected ritual killer and murdered woman were known to be mentally ill.
