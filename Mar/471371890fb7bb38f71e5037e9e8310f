Riyad Mahrez scored the only goal as Manchester City overcame injuries to Kevin de Bruyne and John Stones to edge past Bournemouth and go two points clear at the top of the Premier League. The champions lost De Bryune and Stones either side of the break before Mahrez – on for Belgian De Bruyne – fired City in front at the start of the second half. Sergio Aguero hit the bar from long range before Mahrez saw his header well saved by Artur Boruc as City continued to dominate. But Pep Guardiola’s side held on for a narrow victory that puts the pressure back on title rivals Liverpool, who can return to the summit with victory over Everton in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park on Sunday. And Romelu Lukaku hit a late winner as Manchester United moved to within three points of third-placed Tottenham after a pulsating game with Southampton. With United two minutes from missing out on fourth spot, Romelu Lukaku struck with a calm finish to seal the points at Old Trafford. Yan Valery had given struggling Saints a surprise lead with an outstanding finish from around 25 yards before United turned it around with two goals in six second-half minutes. Andreas Pereira equalised with a spectacular long-range strike before setting up Lukaku to make it 2-1. Saints fought back to make it 2-2 through James Ward-Prowse’s exquisite free-kick before Lukaku dramatic winner. Earlier, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal played out a dramatic 1-1 draw in Saturday’s North London derby in the Premier League. Aaron Ramsey put Arsenal into an early advantage at Wembley Stadium, but Harry Kane equalised for the home side from the penalty spot despite being fouled having come from an offside position. Spurs pushed for a winner, but it was Arsenal who missed out on glory in the closing stages with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang having a spot kick saved by Hugo Lloris, report the BBC
