Enugu Rangers Technical Director, Christian Chukwu, has predicted that Etoile du Sahel of Tunisia will lose to his team in this weekend’s second leg of their CAF Confederation Cup. Both sides are billed to tango in their fourth group match on Sunday at Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium, Enugu, and The Flying Antelopes’ former captain and coach is talking tough. Although the Coal City side lost the first leg 2-1 last Sunday in Tunisia, Chukwu is of the view that Coach Gbenga Ogunbote’s wards have learnt their lesson from that game, and will take Etoile to the cleaners. Chukwu, who went on to captain Nigeria to the country’s first conquest of the Africa Cup of Nations on home soil in 1980, said he was not overconfident when he insisted Rangers would carry the day at home. “Rangers I know will take their own pound of flesh in Enugu. We are not unbeatable but we will defeat the Tunisians in Enugu on Sunday,” he said.
