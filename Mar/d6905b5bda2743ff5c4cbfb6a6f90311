 Rangers International Technical Adviser, Christian Chukwu, has blamed the struggles by Nigerian clubs in continental competitions on inadequate funding and advocated for improved sponsorship, with a view towards better performances on the African scene. Speaking against the backdrop of his club’s 1-1 draw away to Salitas of Burkina Faso in the CAF Confederation Cup on Sunday, Chukwu argued that lack of funds always crops up whenever a Nigerian club is travelling.
Rangers lost back-to-back against Etoile du Sahel of Tunisia in their past two matches, first away and then at home, but Sunday’s draw means it is a mathematical calculation keeping them in the race. The Flying Antelopes, who have five points, will play host to their group leaders, Etoile who have nine points in their last game, while second placed, SC Sfaxien also of Tunisia with seven points are at home against Salitas, such that Chukwu reckons that North African clubs always have an edge.
He opined that the edge teams from north of the continent had is first about the availability of money and then due to the fact that they are able to keep their best players in their squads for longer period of time. Chukwu posited: “When the Tunisian club were coming to Nigeria, they arrived in a chartered flight with all machineries in place. “Any time Nigerian teams want to travel they struggle to even carry the complete players registered for the competition in commercial flights.
“Again, Nigerian talented players are always moving to North African, Asian, North American and European leagues.
“If Nigerian players were well paid, they will remain here. Even foreign footballers will be attracted to come and play in the country.
“In the 1980s when I was playing, we didn’t have issues of several of the players moving around which can affect the build-up of a team.” “You cannot find that happening now because making money is the main thing on the minds of these players.”
