Super Eagles Manager, Gernot Rohr, is in talks with the Nigeria Football Federation over hiring of another physical trainer for the team ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations which takes place in Egypt. In a bid to achieve success in AFCON, Rohr, our correspondent scooped, had asked for an additional physical trainer to work with the team before the final camping later in May. “The fitness level of the players is key to achieving great performances in any tournament; so, I am taking the fitness of my players very seriously ahead of 2019 AFCON. I urgently need a second physical trainer in order to prepare this team well physically. “Before the final camping, I will send my physical coaches to the clubs of my players abroad to check their fitness level, most especially the injured ones that are recuperating,” he said. The German coach added that he did not want to prosecute the tournament with players who are not fully fit. “I don’t want to go to Egypt with any player below 100 per cent fitness level. Some of the cubs in Europe have one physical trainer, a reason why they can’t concentrate on one injured player only. “If I am able to secure the services of another physical trainer/coach the two of them will be able to go to my players’ clubs to help out,” he said. The Super Eagles are set to take on the Pirates of Seychelles in a deadrubber AFCON qualifier and Egypt in an international friendly later this month.
