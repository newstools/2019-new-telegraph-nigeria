Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, has said that the FCT Administration would continue to provide the enabling environment for the promotion of the entertainment industry in the territory. Bello, who gave the assurance, when he received the Managing Director, Nigerian Film Corporation, Dr. Chidia Maduekwe and his team, who were on a courtesy visit to his office, said his interest in the Corporation grew after witnessing the last Zuma Film Festival held in Abuja. According to the Minister, the Corporation is doing well and the FCTA would endeavour to provide the needed environment for the success of its mandate. Earlier, the Managing Director of the Corporation had solicited partnership with FCT Administration for the annual hosting of the Zuma Film Festival. He said the FCTA needed to hold the host status for the festival rather than play the guest role it had played in previous events. He particularly requested that the FCTA secure for use, the International Conference Centre Abuja for the week-long event scheduled to hold in December. Maduekwe who described the Nigeria entertainment industry as robust, said “the creative industry is currently contributing 2.3 per cent of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and there is no reason why we cannot get to 10 per cent. It is possible and in line with President Muhammadu Buhari’s drive to diversify the nation’s economy”. He stressed the need to showcase Abuja as an entertainment destination in the film industry, adding that the Corporation is working to ensure that Nigeria is listed in the World Calendar of film festivals.
