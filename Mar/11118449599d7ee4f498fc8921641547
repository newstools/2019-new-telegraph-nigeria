Osun State Governor, Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola has hailed the people for voting candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in last Saturday’s House of Assembly election. According to him, having absolute majority in the legislature would enable the government to move at a pace that would fast track the development agenda of his administration. Oyetola said with a steady support from the House of Assembly, there would be no inhibition for the government to deliver the democracy dividends it promised its people during the campaigns. He said: “The outcome of the House of Assembly election is further proof of the popularity of our party in this state. It shows that nobody can describe our victory in previous elections as a fluke. “Already, we have launched out on a massive scale in road rehabilitation across major towns. “The grading of critical rural roads is ongoing. “We have also flagged off revitalization of Nine major/secondary hospitals and 332 Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCs) (one per ward) to take healthcare to our people at the grassroots. “Our big plans for agriculture and mining will come on steam soon. We are set to hold our First Economic Summit to launch the state into a boom.” The APC won 22 of 25 Assembly seats which results were declared on yesterday by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The party was leading comfortably in Oriade State Constituency of which result was declared inconclusive by the electoral agency. Meanwhile, INEC yesterday declared APC winner of the just concluded Osun state House of Assembly election. The commission through its Resident Commissioner, Kayode Agbaje in a result sheet of the election made available to newsmen in Osogbo, the state capital, said APC led the exercise in twenty-two local governments of the state out of the twenty-six state constituency in the state.
