All is set in Delta state for the Super Eagles’ clashes with Seychelles and Egypt at the Stephen Keshi Stadium Asaba. The Commissioner for Information, Patrick Ukah, said finishing touches were being put on the stadium so as to get it ready He said the collapsed scoreboard had been replaced and better positioned to forestall such occurrence in the future. He recalled the outcome of the state’s Executive Council meeting of February 5, which compelled the contractor handling the project to fix the damaged part of the stadium as the project had not been officially handed over to the state government. He listed the immediate attention being received by the stadium to include the interlocking work on the outer part, the repair of the damaged sitting arena, the reconstruction of the obsolete parameter fencing and the installation of the emergency outlets.
He was confident that the contractor would finish strongly and nothing will disrupt the lined up sports’ activities billed to take place in the stadium. “His Excellency, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, is ever ready; as a sports-loving Governor, he has put machinery in place to retain and uplift the sporting glory of the state, hence, Nigeria – Seychelles encounter will not be an exception,” he said.
The former chairman of the state’s chapter of the Sports Writers’ Association of Nigeria, Mike Ikeogwu, hailed the preparatory prowess of Governor Okowa.
“The Governor has turned the state into sports destination. He has attracted more improvement on the experiences of football fans and other spectators during last matches between Enugu Rangers and Kano Pillars, Nigeria and Uganda, and the hosting of the All African Athletics Championship,” he said.
