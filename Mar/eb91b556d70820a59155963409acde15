 Despite the high import duty and levy, Nigeria increased the number of vehicles imported from the United States by 10.37 per cent or $54.9 million from $474.6 million in 2017 to N193.2 billion ($529.5 million) last year, New Telegraph has learnt.
It was gathered that within a year, a total of N408 billion ($1.12 billion) vehicles were ferried into the country from United States, India and China. However, findings by this newspaper revealed that more automobiles were imported from United States than China and India as the Automotive Industry Development Plan (NAIDP) failed to deliver at least 400,000 new vehicles from the 35 assembly plants it envisaged in 2017 as planned. Last year, China and India exported $365 million and $228 million vehicles respectively. Data from United Nations’ comtrade portal on Nigerian imports revealed that the same trend happened in 2017 when United States exported $474.6 million vehicles to the country, followed by China’s $366.3 million and India $274 million.
It was also gathered that Japanese vehicle imports to the country dropped from $85 million to $43 million in 2018.
Germany exports also declined from $139.9 million to $54 million in the period. Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA)’s shipping data revealed that between 2017 and 2018, no fewer than 229,690 vehicles were imported through the seaports.
It was revealed that some 180,753 vehicles were imported in 2017 alone. The shipping statistics show that Tincan port took delivery of 12,400 vehicles from Mediterranean region in the period. The vehicles were transported to the country by the Italian shipping line, Grimaldi Group, to the Port and Terminal and Multi-services Limited (PTML). Between January and February 2018, no fewer than 8,000 vehicles were discharged by the shipping company. Meanwhile, NPA’s statistics revealed that 3,550 units of vehicles were shipped to PTML by 10 vessels in December, 2018 alone. The shipping position noted Grande Coastal Davoria came with 350 units; Grande Lagos, 450 units; Grande Guinea, 350 units and Rep Argentian, 300 units. Paran had 300 units; Grande Abdjan, 400 units; Grande Togo, 300 units; Grande Tema, 400 units; Grande Luanda, 400 units and Grande Congo, 300 units. Also last October and November, Rep Argentina discharged 300 units; Grand Dakar, 400 units, Pagna, 400 units; Rep Delibrasile, 350 units; Grand Cotonou, 400 units and Grande Costa Devorte, 300 units. Speaking on the influx of vehicles from the United States, Managing Director of Sceptre Consult, Mr Olatunde Jayeola, explained that it was cheaper to import vehicle from United States because most of the cars coming to the country from there are damaged vehicles. He said a new car of 1.8 litre engine capacity cost as high as N18 million, while a two-litre engine capacity costs N20 million, three-litre new Japanese car costs N30 million, a 30-seater bus costs N45 million and 18-seater bus costs N29 million. Jayeola said that because of these, importers preferred to bring their vehicles where it would be less cheap, saying American specs, when damaged, are cheaper. In 2018, the Managing Director of Port and Terminal and Multi-services Limited (PTML), Mr. Ascanio Russo, said that 50 per cent of the country’s roll-on roll-off imports had been diverted to the neighbouring port.
He noted that the company’s sister, Grimaldi Lines, had the records of vehicles shipped to the neighbouring port. Russo said: “We have Grimaldi lines in different countries and we operate in Cotonou. We have the records of what is going there; I can tell you that over 50 per cent of vehicles, which belongs to Nigerians, are discharged in Cotonou Port because it is expensive to clear in Nigeria.”
