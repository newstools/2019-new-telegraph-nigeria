Social media has been abuzz with the news of two popular faces in the Nigerian entertainment scene who fell apart in their business relationship. Sensational singer, Iyanya Mbuk, in an interview accused his former business partner and CEO of Made Man Music Group (MMMG), Ubi Franklin, of forging his signature in a settlement document when he left the record label. He made it known that he co-owned the label with Franklin, but had taken his exit when he found out that his name was not in any of the forms he had signed. “I really don’t like to talk about all this stuff but I also feel like sometimes you have to clear the air and it’s a good thing that you’re asking this. When I say there was darkness, I was not myself anymore because I felt like there was no trust anymore. “At the time I thought I co-owned Made Men with Ubi but I later realised that my name was not on any of the forms… That was the beginning of me just saying to hell with everything,” he said in an interview with Nnadi TV. Upon getting wind of the interview, Ubi Franklin came out to give his own side of the story. He went as far as sharing official documents that revealed that contrary to Iyanya’s claims, his name was included in the documents. The issue between the two had given rise to an onslaught of name calling and insults on the MMMG boss, as many had insisted that he betrayed the talented singer. But, Franklin took to popular micro-blogging platform Twitter; with a post in which he made it known that he has forgiven everyone who had said dirty things about him. He, however, assured them, that they would eat their words soon.
