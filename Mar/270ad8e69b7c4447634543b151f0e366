All the social media aside, it became clear that we are set for the next level of the disagreement between 2face and Blackface, former members of all boys group, Plantashun Boiz, with the matter going to court. The N50M defamation of character case filed by 2face Idibia against Blackface was on Wednesday listed before Justice Oyefeso of the Lagos State High Court it was adjourned. According to the ruling, a new date will be conveyed to the parties within one week on the next phase of the suit. The case filed against me by @ official2baba & his manager @efeomorogbe comes up next Wednesday 20/3/2019 when the court will rule on our preliminary objection to the baseless N50 million lawsuit filed against me. We need to clean up the business of entertainment in Nigeria. One way or another, we win….#entertainment #BFNfans #iplaw @lawyer9ja @blackface9ja_ news,” Blackface’s lawyer, Mani Enajeroh of M.O Enajeroh, wrote to Pulse in a statement. ‘’The Copyright system in Nigeria will eventually kill every iota of creativity in Nigerian music, unless someone takes up this issue of royalties. Even though we don’t have functioning collective societies that doesn’t mean we can’t be fair to one another. Because of speaking out about this Blackface was sued for N50m. “That’s why it’s important that this case must be struck out. The case is a threat to freedom of expression, and intellectual property in general. We are confident that the Court will strike out the case. “This is a copyright issue, no matter how you look at it and it ought to be at the Federal High Court. Look at their court documents, they did not admit anywhere that Blackface wrote, ‘Let somebody love you’. The stories are never consistent,’’ he added.
