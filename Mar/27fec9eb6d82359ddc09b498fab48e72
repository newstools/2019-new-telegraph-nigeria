Augustine ‘Tekno’ Miles, Nigerian entertainer, says no artiste can attain success in the music industry without imitating others. The ‘Pana’ singer shared his opinion in a recent video while hanging out with Paul “Rudeboy” Okoye, Kcee and J-Martins. “Any artiste wey say he no dey copy, cannot be successful,” he said. In the 26-second footage, Kcee can be seen showing his support for Tekno while Rude Boy seemed unwilling to take part in the conversation. “Nothing concern me oh, I dey make my money,” Rudeboy said. Tekno came under intense criticism and backlashes last year after he released a single titled, ‘Jogodo’. The criticism stemmed from claims that the songwriter was not the brainchild of the hit song. Danfo Driver, Nigerian ghetto singers, had threatened to deal with Tekno after they accused him of sampling their intellectual property without their consent. “Tekno dey owe us money o… Tekno dey make us vex and if I catch am e no go like me… you just come dey carry pessin song dey go dey sing… God save am because we no dey Lagos, now set we don enter Lagos, na because of Tekno we don come here… if I catch am,” Mountain Black of Danfo Driver had said.
