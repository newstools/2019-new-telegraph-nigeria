Wife of the Governor of Lagos State, Mrs. Bolanle Ambode, has described the collapsed building which claimed the lives of some school pupils and others at Itafaaji area of the state during the week, as a very sad and painful incident even as she prayed for the repose of their souls. Mrs. Ambode who is currently out of the country, noted that a sad occurrence like this could have been prevented if property developers adhered strictly to building code and integrity test, stressing that lives were too precious to be sacrificed for economic gains. She lamented that it was most unfortunate that young pupils in the course of education should meet such a tragic fate. She said: “As a mother I feel pained and sad that little pupils in the course of education should meet such a tragic fate.” She prayed that God would comfort the families of the deceased children, bring quick recovery for the injured and prevent a recurrence of such fatal tragedy.
