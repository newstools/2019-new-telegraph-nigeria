The Wives’ Revolt, a play about the marginalisation of women and the injustices they face in life, is set to go on stage in Lagos.  The play which will be staged this Friday, 29th and Sunday 31st of March 2019, at the Agip Hall, MUSON Centre, Onikan, Lagos, seeks to highlight the ignorance and unconsciousness of men on certain issues that remain important to women.  Directed by Toritseju Ejoh, the play features a stellar cast comprising some of Nigeria’s finest Theatre exports: Toyin Oshinaike, Zara Udofia-Ejoh and Albert Akaeze.   When a small community in the Niger-Delta receives a payout from the oil company drilling their land, it turns out to be the kindling that stokes the flames of revolution in the women of the town. The money is to be shared three ways- elders, men and women- with the community elders getting the lion’s share. The women of the town, who have long suffered injustice and marginalisation complain about the unfairness of this arrangement; the elders are also men, meaning they enjoy a second helping from the payout.  The Wives’ Revolt, a play about the marginalisation of women and the injustices they face in life, and what happens when women in one community decide to stand up against their oppressors and oppression with the support of a few good men.
