Scores of persons have been reportedly killed in a fresh attack by gunmen in Kaduna State. The incident took place in Angwan Barde village, Kajuru Local Government Area in the southern part of Kaduna state. Several houses were also said to have been destroyed and others burnt in the attack which a source said started Saturday evening and spilt over to Sunday morning. The fresh attack is coming less than two weeks after gunmen invaded Karamai village, also in Kajuru Local Government Area, killing not less 40 people while several houses were also burnt. A resident of the village who did not want his name mentioned said the attacks started on Saturday when people who went to their farms after voting in the governorship and House of Assembly elections were attacked and some of them killed. He said: “The gunmen in their numbers invaded Angwan Barde village, killing and setting houses ablaze. “What we are hearing is that they are done attacking Ungwan Barde, they are now advancing towards the next village which is Sabon Gida. ”They started an isolated attack on Saturday. Someone voted and went to his farm and he was killed. Five people went to search for him and they were also attacked one of them was killed and four came back alive. I am not in a position to give you casualty figures until the situation is calm, I don’t want to give wrong figures”. This is not the first time that the community is coming under attack in the recent past. On February 11  suspected Fulani herdsmen invaded the village at about midnight and killed 11 people. The attack led to reprisals on Fulani settlements in the area where many people were said to have been killed. Efforts to speak with the spokesman of the Kaduna state police command, Yakubu Sabo, was yet to yield result as he did not respond to telephone calls and a text message sent to his mobile phone.
