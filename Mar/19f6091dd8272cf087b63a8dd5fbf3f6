Champions League winner Mikel Obi says promotion to the English Premier League with Middlesbrough would rank as one of his finest moments in football. The 31-year-old midfielder collected two Premier League titles, a Champions League, Europa League and three FA Cup winners medals with Chelsea, and joined Boro on a short-term deal in January. “If we manage to pull it [promotion] off, it would be amazing,” he said. “It would be up there as one of my greatest achievements.” Mikel Obi moved to the Riverside Stadium as a free agent after a lucrative stint in China with Tianjin Teda. Boro have lost just once in the league since his arrival and are fifth in the Championship with 12 games remaining. A drop into England’s second tier was something new for the Nigeria international, who captained his country at the 2018 World Cup and won the Africa Cup of Nations with the Super Eagles in 2013. “I’m still hungry and want to win trophies. I’m never satisfied with what I have achieved. If I was, I would just sit at home,” he told BBC Sport. “I want to achieve something with this club and that is to get this club promoted. “I love challenges and I knew coming in here would be a challenge for me, and being in the second division would be a challenge for me.  “I knew this club would be pushing for promotion and managing to do that wouldn’t be easy.” With a game in hand on all four sides above them, Boro are nine points adrift of the top two and an automatic promotion spot.  As for his own future beyond his short-term deal until the end of the season, Mikel was coy despite saying he felt “at home” and was “enjoying” his time on Teesside.  “I want to enjoy my football and enjoy winning games with this club, these players are an amazing group of guys,” he said.  “Every time we win a game you see that feeling of wanting to be in the Premier League and that is something I want to keep enjoying with them until the end of the season. And then we see where we are.”
