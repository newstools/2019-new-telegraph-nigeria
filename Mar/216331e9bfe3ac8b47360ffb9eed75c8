However, in view of their plea, the prosecution counsel, G.C. Akaogu, asked for a trial date and urged the defendants be remanded in prison custody. However, defendants’ lawyer, I. T. Oyedepo and Abdulrahman Dirisu respectively informed the court of bail applications on behalf of their clients. Oyedepo, counsel to Salvador, (first defendant) prayed the court to grant his client bail in liberal terms in an application dated 8th March, 2019. Dirisu, counsel to Olatunji, (second defendant), also pleaded same for his client, pending the determination of the case. Justice Solebo granted each of the defendants bail in the sum of N10, 000,000.00 (Ten Million Naira) and two sureties in like sum. The sureties must be resident in Lagos with proof of residence, proof of employment and tax payment in the past three years.
One of the two sureties for each of the defendants must also be a property owner in Lagos, which will be verified by the registrar of the court. Justice Solebo, however, ordered the defendants to be remanded in prison custody pending the fulfilment of their bail conditions and adjourned the matter till 29th April and 30, 2019 for trial.
