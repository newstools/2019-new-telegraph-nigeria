The break up between Oba Adeyeye, the Ooni of Ile-Ife and his former wife, Queen Otiti, was not a pleasant incident many will recall for a long time.  When the incident happened, it became subject of discussion so much that even the media feasted on it.  Oba Adeyeye has since moved on as heâ€™s married to a new wife. As it concerns Queen Otiti however, the tale of her getting married to someone else was rife some time ago, but till this moment, nothing suggests the light skinned lady is thinking about marriage.  The Edo-born beautiful lady has been busy shuttling between Nigeria and Middle East in a bid to entrench peace around the world as well as make life bearable for all and sundry
