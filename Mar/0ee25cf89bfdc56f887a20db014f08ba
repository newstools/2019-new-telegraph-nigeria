There have been concerns by voters in Kwara State, regarding the heavy military presence in the State. With a military and DSS check presence reportedly positioned every poll in Ilorin metropolis and Kwara State at large, the people of Kwara are beginning to ask if all is well in the state. Recall that an Airforce fighter jet was deployed to Kwara State yesterday to add to the Federal mightâ€™s show of force. It has been reported that the Nigerian Army in Kwara State has allegedly allowed and in some cases partook in targeted harassment PDP agents, forcing them to leave the polling units where they have been assigned. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1.jpg?resize=740%2C987&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="740" height="987" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-194980" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" data-recalc-dims="1"> This took place in a large number of polling units around Ilorin and Kwara South, as the army reportedly chased agents suspected to be of the PDP, from the polling units, threatening mayhem, if they come back.
