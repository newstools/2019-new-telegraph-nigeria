Justice Lekan Ogunmoye of an Ado Ekiti High Court yesterday sentenced a member of the Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN), Abednego Ajibola, to death by hanging. Ajibola killed his colleague, Ojo Ogunsakin, over loading disagreement at Akure ‘Garage’ on Ikere Road in Ado-Ekiti on March 10, 2017. Ogunmoye held that evidence before the court found Ajibola (40) guilty of killing Ogunsakin (42) contrary to Section 316 of Criminal Code Cap C16 Laws of Ekiti State 2012. In his confessional statement volunteered to the police, Ajibola said a brawl broke out between him and the deceased on loading arrangement on the said date. The convict said Ogunsakin slapped him which provoked him to retaliate by attacking with a stone which led to his death. The prosecution counsel, Mr. Gbemiga Adaramola, called six witnesses, including the Investigating Police Officer (IPO), Sergeant Kamaru Momoh, the wife of the deceased, Mrs. Ogunsakin, and Dr. J. A. Omotayo of Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital (EKSUTH), who conducted the post-mortem on the body. The defence counsel, Mr. Kayode Oyeyemi, called two witnesses and the Ajibola to convince the court of his innocence. Ogunmoye said: “The ingredients of the offence of murder had been established against the accused person and he is convicted accordingly. “The accused person is hereby sentenced to death by hanging on the neck till he be dead. May the Almighty God have mercy on your soul.”
