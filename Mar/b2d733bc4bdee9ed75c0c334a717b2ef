Residents in nearby buildings disclosed that the three-storey building had been showing signs of distress before it caved in yesterday. They said it had been peeling off with some parts already partially giving way before it eventually caved in. According to residents of the area, the building was over 50 years old and that the owner had not carried out any major rehabilitation except painting of the outer part. For the rescue and emergency responders such as the officials of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Rapid Response Squad (RSS), Lagos Neighbourhood and Safety Corps (LNSC) and other agencies, it was a busy and difficult day as they had hectic time controlling and managing the crowd at the same time. The developer of the ill-fated building is yet to be discovered. It was learnt that the building had shops on the ground floor; its first and second floors housed the primary and nursery schools. The third floor was used as residential. For hours, heavy duty rescue equipment deployed to the scene couldnâ€™t move in due to the over-chocked nature of buildings on the Island, but many residents volunteered to rescue the trapped victims. As at the time of filing this report, about 45 people had been rescued and rushed to the General Hospital, while a yet to be ascertained number of trapped victims were said to have died upon recovery of their bodies from the rubble.
