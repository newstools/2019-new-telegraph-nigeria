 Scientists in the United States (US) said children who were exposed to common pesticides, either while in the womb or in the first year of life, may be more likely to develop autism. The findings of a new study published in British Medical Journal (BMJ), showed that women who lived within 2,000 meters (about 1.2 miles) of an highly pesticide sprayed area during their pregnancy were 10 per cent to 16 per cent more likely to have children diagnosed with autism. Similarly, that risk increased further, to roughly 30 per cent, in cases where the child had severe autism (with intellectual disability). Exposure to pesticides during the first year of life bumped the increased risk up to 50 per cent, the study showed. While the researchers stressed that itâ€™s premature to say that pesticide exposure actually causes autism, they pointed out that theirs was not the first investigation to sound alarm bells on the dangers that pesticides might pose to brain development. Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of conditions characterised by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviours, speech and nonverbal communication. In the study, scientists at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) tracked exposure to 11 common pesticides in an agricultural region of California among nearly 3,000 kids with autism born between 1998 and 2010. These kids were compared with more than 35,000 California residents who had been born within the same time frame, but did not have autism. According to the team led Dr. Ondine von Ehrenstein who is an associate professor in the departments of community health science and epidemiology at UCLA, all of the chemicals that the scientists tracked had previously been linked to some degree of brain toxicity risk, noted the Amanda Bakian.
