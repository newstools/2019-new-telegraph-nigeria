 Tami punched his chest but he wouldn’t relax his grip on her. “No Tume!” She screamed and he released her immediately. “How could you! Can’t you rein in your snake? I’m disappointed in you. Your wife is a sister to me. Moreover, you know I’m not into such nonsense. Please, go away,” she screamed. She was shocked. Tume watched her as she backed off. “Tami, I’m not as bad as you think. I know I have been misbehaving and I really want to change,” he said, observing her closely. “I have been bearing a burden in my heart for years. I need to talk to you. I can’t say it to another person…” “Abeg go tell your secret to your wife. I don’t want to hear,” Tami said. He ignored her and continued, “As a young boy, we had an auntie who was taking care of my siblings and I at home. My parents were working class and were seldom at home. Our auntie took advantage of that to set me on the wrong path. By the time I was eight years, <img class="size-medium wp-image-196811 alignleft" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sweet-smelling-evil-3.png?resize=300%2C158&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="158" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sweet-smelling-evil-3.png?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sweet-smelling-evil-3.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1">Auntie had taught me what I shouldn’t know.” Tami turned and stared at him. “When I got into the secondary school, I got introduced to another lifestyle. We were all boys and we did all sort of things. I was a boarder. Of course, Auntie got me addicted to behind closed door activities and it was easy for me to join likeminds in the hostel. The problem was that we were all boys!” Tume said quietly. Tami opened her mouth in shock and asked, “You mean you are gay? Tume, answer me. Are you gay?” Tume’s shoulders drooped as he continued, “I became a bi when I entered the university. But I knew what I was doing was wrong. I resolved to go straight by going after girls a lot. I felt that was the only way I could stop my yearning for fellow bones. It worked but I got addicted to supple flesh. I’m sorry. I couldn’t have told my wife this. It would kill her. That’s why I didn’t want her to call me ‘BIG Tee’. It reminds me of those days.” His shoulders were heaving now. Tami knew he was going through a very emotional moment. “Sorry Tume. You have to get yourself together. Your past is in the past. The present is what matters now. You have to think of your pregnant wife. You have to make her happy all the time,” she said, moving towards him. He looked so vulnerable. He looked up and she saw his shiny eyes. Tears were welling up there. “Sorry Tume,” she said again for want of something better to say and patted his shoulders. He wiped his eyes with the back of his right palm and her heart melted. He stood up, held out his right palm and she took it. They embraced. That sealed the secret, their secret. After that incidence, they talked more on the phone. Two or three times each week, they had lunch together. Tume no longer showed much interest in women. Tami was still visiting Nessa at home. During one of such visits, Nessa told her friend, “Babe, I have some Ankara materials I’ll like you to take to your tailor for me. I want to make some funky maternity outfits that I can wear when going to the hospital for antenatal.”
“No problem babes,” Tami replied. As she was about to leave, the rain came down hard. “You’ll have to wait for Tume to take you home. He’ll soon be back,” Nessa told her. After dinner, Tume took Tami home. By the time they got to her house, visibility was very poor. Driving would be suicidal. He had to wait until the rain abated and they decided to go into her flat. They jumped out of the car and dashed into the building. They got a bit wet and she was cold. When they entered her flat, she went straight to her bedroom to change into a dry gown. Tume removed his shirt and draped it on the back of a dinning chair. She made two hot mugs of tea and they drank and watched a film. The rain continued pouring down on the roof but now accompanied by lightening and Thunder. Tami shivered and he drew her towards him. He felt her stiffen but he held her tightly until she relaxed. Tami’s mind was in turmoil. She didn’t know what to think. “This is wrong,” her mind told her, but her body had taken on a life of its own. She felt his warmth. She couldn’t remember the last time she felt a man’s warmth. “What am I getting into? I shouldn’t be doing this but I have always wanted to do this. Tami, why are you such a good friend? Why…,” Tume agonised in his mind. “Tami,” he whispered and she turned her face to him and their lips met! Tami froze. What! This was so wrong, her mind told her. Run, run, her mind told her and she made to stand up, but her limbs wouldn’t move. Tume drew her into his arms and kissed her deeply. When she didn’t resist again, he ran his fingers all over her. When he got to the mounds on her chest, he massaged them gently. Tami moaned softly. He unbuttoned the first four buttons on her dress and pulled it down her shoulders, exposing velvety skin. Her nipples were taunt. Her bulbous tits were tempting. He played with the nipples for a while, then lowered his lips on them. Tami moaned aloud. Her mind warned her to stop him. She wiggled and he left her. She managed to stand on her feet but her gown, which had nothing holding it, slipped off her body and framed her feet. The cold weather made her shiver. Tume stared at the nude form standing before him and reason flew off his mind. He drank in the curves as his eyes dwelled on her hairy mound. His snake was knocking, it wanted to be let out. He couldn’t remember the last time he saw a bush baby. Adrenalin pumped up his groin. Tami’s mind went berserk. This wasn’t her plan. She had forgotten that he had unfastened her buttons! She shivered again and he reach out and grabbed her. She couldn’t resist his touch. Her cave was juicing. She was slippery wet! Tume sat her on the couch and went on his knees, between her legs. He went for those tempting bulbs again and fed on them like a hungry newborn. His fingers traced an invincible pattern down her body until they got to the bushy mound. The feel of the slippery wet grass did something to him. He shivered uncontrollably as he worked his fingers in there. Tami, eyes closed tightly, threw her limbs apart. She was no longer in control of anything in her body. Tumi’s tongue traveled down her body, tarried on her belly button awhile and then proceeded downward to its final destination. She jerked as his lips landed lightly on her mound. Tiny sweet needles pierced her body as he lapped up her juice. Then, he raised her thighs, pulled them up and buried his face in there. She screamed in pleasure as his tongue found her mumu knob therein. She pushed his head to go deeper into her as the rain pelted the roof with vigour…  #####  This is getting more interesting.
