According to Kachikwu, DPR is contributory to income generation. Kachikwu said that the highest bid was about N3 billion.
The petroleum minister noted that the total projected potential cost for the building when it is done is about N35 billion. “So, if you look at that as a percentage of the work, it is absolutely insignificant. In international terms, it is very justifiable; it is less than two per cent. “The FCT did mention in our deliberation that because of the new zoning policies, the previous plan, which was to build a car park of another five floors along with the 12 floors, have to be changed a little bit because they are taking possession of additional green area that were assigned to them. “So, they will build a lot of parking lots within the building and I think because of the amount of work to be done and in line with international practice, it is quite very reasonable.
“Let me also say that part of the programmes we have pursued in the ministry is how to get a lot of our parastatals to become independent and financial-generating agency and so get out of federal budget. NSNB has done that, DPR is the one to do that next. So a lot of funding for this development is going to come out of DPR itself, not out of federal budgeting. “The plan is that if we continue the way we are doing, a lot of federal agencies will be out of federal budgeting and be self-reliant, be it PPPRA, DPR, PEF, that is the game plan. So far we have exited NCDB and we are near existing DPR and then PEF,” he added.
In his remarks, the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Dr. Okechukwu Enelemah, told reporters that FEC also approved a contract to engage a Programme Management Office Consultant and System Provider, for Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP) at the cost of N1.556 billion. GEEP is part of the social investment programmes of the Federal Government.
According to him, the contract, which is for provision of services for 4.6 million people, is a viable contract.
Enelemah said that the programme has provided credit for over 1.5 million Nigerians. FEC also approved the establishment of a committee to come up with alternative ways to add to what government is doing in financing infrastructure. It will be a committee of Ministers and Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC), Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) and some private sector players. The minister of trade and investment is expected to chair the committee with the ministers of finance, budget and national planning, transportation, water resources, state for aviation and power, works and housing as members. He said the target of government is to achieve between $10 and $20 billion per year over the next five to 10 years.
The amount will be channelled into development of critical infrastructure over the anticipated period. “Obviously, government cannot do it alone and will like to partner others and it is expected to be done as part of the concluding work of this administration,” he said.
The report is expected to be submitted within the next one month. Also speaking, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said council approved contracts for the procurement of cameras, television packs and other broadcast equipment at a cost of N283.8 million for the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA); 15 Peugeot vehicles for News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) at the cost of N151.4 million.
