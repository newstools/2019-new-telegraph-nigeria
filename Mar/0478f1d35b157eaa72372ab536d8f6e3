 An unforgettable epic that is guaranteed to buzz for a long time. That aptly described the just-concluded GTBank 2019 Lagos International Polo Tournament that crowned new champions, with Abuja Almat winning the highly revered Majekodunmi Cup at the first time of asking.
The prestigious polo carnival that pitched over 34 teams and top Nigerian and foreign players left in its glowing trail many memorable highpoints both on and off the pitch. One such glittering highlight was the curtain drawing final game that decided the winners of the event’s biggest prize and Nigeria’s oldest polo trophy, the Independence Cup.
The final game that was decided before loaded galleries of the foremost Ikoyi Polo Club saw Bode Makanjuela’s Centaurs taking an early lead with two quick goals through Diego White and held on till the third chukka, when Maurice Ekpenyong’s Almat responded with two goals.
Almat fought back gallantly to draw level 6-6 in the fifth chukka, but their rally came rather late as Centaurs added two more goals in the dying minutes to stun their Abuja-based opponents for an 8-6 final score. Almat completed a memorable tournament by also carting home the Italian Ambassador’s Cup with a 11-8 win over Lagos STL.
The Low Cup final that preceded the final game, also produced a new winner as Bello Buba pivoted Sublime team out gun Aplus RCF 51/2-5 in a closely fought final game to win Low Cup, while Kano Ibah got the better of Lagos Agad team to clinch the subsidiary prize.
In the first phase, Kaduna Trapcco won the Open Cup while Lagos NRT won the Silver Cup. A Plus won the Oba of Lagos Cup.
