Controversial former Big Brother Naija housemate, Cee-C, has disclosed why she engaged in so many fights with Tobi.
You’d recall that Tobi and Cee-c were emotionally involved and fought at every given opportunity while in ‘Double Wahala’ edition of BBNaija 2018 reality show.
But, speaking during ‘DoubleWahalaReloaded’ reunion show, Cee-c admitted to Ebuka that she fought with Tobi a lot because she was jealous and always wanted him for herself.
She said: “Yea, I fought a lot of times with Tobi because I wanted him to myself, but he is a socialite and wanted to mix with everyone. I was really jealous but the viewers were not easy on us following fights we had.”
On why her relationship with Tobi did not work out, Cee-C added that they were not compatible.
“I did everything I had to do to get us together but we were not meant together,” she added.
