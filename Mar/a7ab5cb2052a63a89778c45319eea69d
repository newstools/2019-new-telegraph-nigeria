The Minister of Youth and Sports Solomon Dalung, has congratulated Nigeria’s U-19 Cricket Team, the Junior Yellow Greens for picking the country’s first ever spot at the Cricket World Cup after topping the weeklong qualifying series held in Windhoek, Namibia on Saturday March 23, 2019. Nigeria defeated Sierra Leone with two wickets in a tension soaked encounter that was the highlight of the weeklong run of victories against Africa’s Division one Cricket powerhouses including Namibia, Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. Dalung said that the qualification had proven that Nigerian sportsmen and women can do exploits if given the right support to compete. “I congratulate the Junior Yellow Greens for clinching Nigeria’s first ever Cricket World Cup ticket. We have recorded another first. This is a great feat and also shows that a great future lies ahead of our youthful sportsmen and women with the right leadership and administration. “I also congratulate the Nigeria Cricket Federation especially the President Dr Adams Yahaya Ukwenya for the new lease of life being pumped into the development of the game of Cricket in the Country. Just last month, the Cricket World Cup Trophy was brought to Nigeria to create awareness of the game and encourage the players.”
