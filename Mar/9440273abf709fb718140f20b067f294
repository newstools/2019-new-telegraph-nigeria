The Oyo State Police Command has halted proposed meeting of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) scheduled for Ibadan, the State capital, worsening the crisis rocking the union. This is followed a petition filed by acting Chairman of the IPMAN in the South-West geopolitical zone, Oba Olufemi Ogbaro, the Odoka of Obe Ogbaro in Ilaje Local Government area of Ondo State. The South-West chapter of IPMAN has earlier disowned the factional meeting called for today at Ibadan, Oyo State capital. Ogbaro had in the petition said the meeting called by factional chairman, Mr Kunle Bamigboye was unknown to the National Executive Council (NEC) of the body. A factional zonal Secretary, Mark Alaba Obu has issued a notice of meeting for IPMAN, house in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. However, Oba Ogbaro said anybody who attended the meeting did so at his risk as the National Executive Council (NEC) of IPMAN had given him letter of appointment as the zonal acting chairman. The zonal Chairman, however, warned the faction to stop parading themselves as executive of the union so as not to risk arrest by law enforcement agents. The letter signed by the National President, Elder Chinedu Okoronkwo and Secretary, Alhaji Danladi Pasali recognized the monarch from Ilaje in Ondo State as the zonal acting chairman. The letter reads: “National Executive Council (NEC) of IPMAN has approved your appointment as the acting zonal Chairman, Southwest zone The National Executive Council (NEC) of IPMAN expects high level performance from you on this assignment. “You are to ensure effective and smooth uninterrupted supply and distribution of petroleum products within your zone.”
