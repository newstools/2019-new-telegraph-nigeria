One of the leading contenders in the race to the Senate Presidency and Leader of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, yesterday gave insight into the colour and character of the ninth Senate. Lawan, who represents Yobe North senatorial district, told reporters in Abuja that the 9th Senate and by extension the 9th National Assembly, would be one in synergy and on the same page with the executive arm of government on the next level agenda.  He said the 9th Senate would have a positive disposition to the aspirations and policy direction of the executive arm of government. According to him, the next Senate would focus more on productivity for the growth and development of the country than hostility with any arm of government.  He said: “All in all, the 9th Senate and by extension, the 9th National Assembly, will be one that will be on the same page with the executive on the next level agenda that will be characterised by robust and smooth business of governance and seamless relationship.”  The ranking lawmaker, who thanked God that they went for the February 23, 2019 election and came out victorious, said the All Progressives Congress (APC) senators did not only win but also gained more seats at the National Assembly than it had in the 8th Senate. He said such positive development for the ruling party, would bring the required synergy between the Senate, the National Assembly as a whole and the executive arm, particularly the Presidency.  Lawan added that their prayer was that the oil price in the international market should increase than it currently was and the daily oil production should increase from 1.9 million barrels per day to the projected 2.3 million barrels per day in the 2019 budget.  The politician said with the expected increase in the oil price and production level, the executive could realise the projected revenue for a friendly National Assembly to give the required appropriation.
