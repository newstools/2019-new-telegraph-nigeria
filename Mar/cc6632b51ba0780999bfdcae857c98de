 Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi may be the most famous soccer players on the planet, but their transfer value is waning with age and they have been leapfrogged by the sport’s brightest talents. Identifying a player’s transfer value is never easy, but a prominent research group in Switzerland the CIES Football Observatory has done just that by updating its list of 100 big-five league players with the highest valuations according to its own algorithm. Only considering players from England’s Premier League, Spain’s La Liga, Italy’s Serie A, Germany’s Bundesliga, and France’s Ligue 1, in order to calculate a player’s value in the current transfer market, the Observatory has been monitoring soccer transactions since 2010, speaking to market actors (club executives operating in elite soccer), and studying factors like playing activity, the club the athlete plays for, the athlete’s age, playing position, and economic level of the releasing club. The findings are interesting, not least because there are now 37 players worth $100 million or more, but also because there are a number of new faces and teenagers who are capable of improving further and enhancing their worth in the transfer market. Here are the 37 most valuable soccer players competing in Europe right now, ranked in ascending order: 37: Atletico Madrid midfielder Sal Guez is worth 90.2 million ($103.9 million). 36: Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford is worth 90.4 million ($104.2 million). 35: Inter Milan striker Mauro Icardi is worth 91.8 million ($105.8 million). 34: Tottenham Hotspur defender Davinson Sanchez is worth 93.6 million ($107.9 million). 33: Tottenham Hotspur forward Son Heung-Min is worth 93.9 million ($108.2 million). 32: Liverpool FC defender Virgil van Dijk is worth 95 million ($109.5 million). 31: Arsenal FC striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is worth 95.4 million ($109.9 million). 30: Manchester City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne is worth 95.6 million ($110.1 million). 29: Chelsea midfielder N’Golo Kant is worth 97.2 million ($112 million). 28: FC Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andr ter Stegen is worth 98 million ($113 million). 27: Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson Moraes is worth 100.1 million ($115.4 million). 26: Manchester City defender Aymeric Laporte is worth 104.3 million ($120.3 million). 25: AS Napoli striker Lorenzo Insigne is worth 104.7 million ($120.7 million). 24: Liverpool FC goalkeeper Alisson Becker is worth 105.6 million ($121.7 million). 23: FC Barcelona striker Luis Surez is worth 109.3 million ($126 million). 22: Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho is worth 112.6 million ($129.75 million). 21: Liverpool FC defender Trent Alexander-Arnold is worth 117.2 million ($135 million). 20: FC Barcelona forward Ousmane Dembl is worth 120.3 million ($138.5 million). 19: Juventus striker Cristiano Ronaldo is worth 127.2 million ($146.5 million). 18: Chelsea forward Eden Hazard is worth 129 million ($148.5 million). 17: Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba is worth 130.3 million ($150 million). 16: Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva is worth 133.2 million ($153.4 million). 15: Manchester City striker Gabriel Jesus is worth 134.6 million ($155 million). 14: Liverpool FC winger Sadio Man is worth 137.4 million ($158.4 million). 13: Liverpool FC striker Roberto Firmino is worth 145.6 million ($167.9 million). 12: Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Dele Alli is worth 150.2 million ($173.3 million). 11: Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann is worth 155.2 million ($179 million). 10: Manchester City winger Leroy San is worth 156.1 million ($180 million). 9: FC Barcelona playmaker Philippe Coutinho is worth 157 million ($180.8 million). 8: Manchester United striker Romelu Lukaku is worth 162 million ($185.8 million). 7: FC Barcelona forward Lionel Messi 171.2 million ($196.3 million). 6: Juventus forward Paulo Dybala 171.9 million ($197.2 million). 5: Liverpool FC striker Mohamed Salah is worth 184.3 million ($211.4 million). 4: Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling is worth 185.8 million ($212.7 million). 3: Paris Saint-Germain striker Neymar is worth 197.1 million ($225.6 million). 2: Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane is valued at 200.3 million ($229.4 million). 1: Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe is currently the most valuable player, worth a whopping 218.5 million ($250.2 million). *Courtesy: pulse.com.gh
