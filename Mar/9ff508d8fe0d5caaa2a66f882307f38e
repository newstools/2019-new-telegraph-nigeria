The National Examinations Council (NECO) yesterday said the council would soon be self-sufficient and would not be needing allocation from the federation account soon. Acting Registrar of the Council, Mr. Abubakar Gana, who made this known when he appeared before the Senate Committee on Basic Education for the defense of NECO’s 2019 budget in Abuja, called for support from the Senate to achieve the feat. Gana, who expressed commitment to deepen the gains recorded within his stint in office, noted that the agency under his supervision was poised to take its place as a transparent body. While disclosing that the council returned about N1 billion to the nation’s Consolidated Revenue Account as operational surplus from its internally generated revenue (IGR), he expressed desire to firm up the reforms being carried out in NECO, adding that the 2019 budget of the agency as presented to the National Assembly, would be judiciously implemented. Recall that under Gana’s leadership, the Federal Government recently slashed NECO registration fees from N11, 350 to N9, 850, thus paving the way for more participation by candidates in its Senior School Certificate Examinations (SSCE).
