The Imo state governorship candidate of the Sustainable National Party (SNP), Mr. Ikechukwu Munonye whose party’s logo was allegedly omitted during the election has said he would not pursue the matter any further in the interest of the state. Munonye made good his resolve by deposing to an affidavit, stating that he had no intention whatsoever of seeking redress in court in spite of his exclusion from the contest. Munonye, who also stated that he had not instructed any person or given consent to any person to take any legal action on his behalf, maintained that any legal process purporting to carry his name as a petitioner or facilitator did not emanate from him. The SNP governorship candidate, however, noted that his decision to back down from seeking legal redress on the matter was predicated on his commitment to the greater good of Imo state. He said: “I have wholeheartedly accepted the election of Rt. Hon. Emeka Ihedioha as the governorelect of Imo state. I dissociate myself from any move or step from any person or my party, to challenge the election and the return of Rt. Hon. Emeka Ihedioha as the governor-elect of Imo state.
