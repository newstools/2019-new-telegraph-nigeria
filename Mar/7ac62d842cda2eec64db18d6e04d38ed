Veteran Nollywood actress, Joke Silva, has hit back at critics who called her out over her congratulatory message to President Muhammadu Buhari on his re-election. Joke Silva had congratulated the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its presidential candidate, Muhammadu Buhari, on their victory in the 2019 elections hours after the declaration of the Independent National Electoral Commissioner, (INEC) in the early hours of Wednesday. Her message, not totally unexpectedly, sparked a fury of replies from some of her followers in the comment section and the 57-yearold actress, who recently lost her younger sister, Bisi Silva, reacted to the trolls via an Instagram post on Thursday. “To the Hounds of the Baskerville who were unleashed on my page yesterday, please unfollow me if you cannot put forward your opinion without being insulting. “Throwing insults is beneath you and tells me you are not solutions driven. Get off my page. If you want to fan the embers of tribalism…get off my page. If you want to fan the embers of religious bigotry please get off my page,” she wrote as part of her post.
