Beautiful actress, Beverly Naya, was born in London but relocated back to Nigeria eight years ago to join Nollywood. She quickly made her mark in the industry and has featured in many blockbuster movies such as, ‘Wedding Party’ and ‘Chief Daddy’. Beverly is also an entrepreneur and was named by Forbes as one of Africa’s most promising entrepreneurs under the age of 30. The British-born Nigerian actress, who recently produced a documentary feature, ‘Skin’ that focused on teaching young girls to love their natural skin colour, speaks to VANESSA OKWARA on her budding career and the kind of man she wants  You recently produced a documentary feature, ‘Skin’. What is it all about? The documentary, ‘Skin’, with theme on colourism is aimed at opening a discourse around self-discovery, self-confidence and preservation of self-identity. In Nigeria, about 77% of our women bleach. So it’s basically a documentary to teach people about self-love and the fact that you are perfect the way God made you. The 80 minutes film is not a campaign against bleaching, even though most of the people being interviewed, including Bobrisky, wish they could go back to their natural skin colour; he admits his regrets on bleaching his skin in the documentary. I concluded it with a trip to my home town, Ibusa, Delta State, where I visited for the first time, exploring the rich cultural heritage. ‘Skin’ is directed by Daniel Etim Effiong, it features interview snippets from Hilda Dokubo, Eku Edewor, Bobrisky and Phyno, as well beauty entrepreneurs, school children, traders and sex workers.  It’s a lovely piece of work, seamlessly stringing together opinions on bleaching, which has created a thriving market in the Nigerian beauty space and my aim is to teach young girls to love their natural skin colour and not join the growing number of Nigerian women bleaching their skin.  What personal experience made you want to do a documentary on skin colour? For me, I got bullied when I was young and it wasn’t because of my skin colour but about the shape of my teeth, I also had eczema and you know how that can be for a child when other children make fun of you, so it affected my self-esteem for a while. As I got older, I didn’t feel beautiful or <img class="size-medium wp-image-200148 alignleft" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Beverly-Naya.png?resize=300%2C153&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="153" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Beverly-Naya.png?resize=300%2C153&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Beverly-Naya.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1">desirable in any way. Even though I had blossomed, I still didn’t feel beautiful. I didn’t believe I was beautiful. So I became an adult with that mindset. It was until I got older I was able to build back my self-confidence. That was when I was about 22 years and even at that some damage has been done on my mindset. That’s why I decided to help young girls to learn early in life to be proud of their skin colour and not be influenced by what they see on social media persuading them to think that ‘light skin is better’.  What do you want the documentary, ‘Skin’ to achieve in the society? I hope that ‘Skin’ is globally impactful. I hope I can encourage young girls, especially in our nation to practice colour acceptance and to love themselves no matter what and not to be easily enticed by what they see in the media and the films or what anyone tells them regarding what beauty is. So I hope the documentary inspires people to just love themselves as they are whatever their skin colour is.  While filming the documentary, you visited your home town, Ibusa for the first time. What was the experience like for you personally? It was an interesting experience for me. It was my first time going to the village. Before going to the village, I didn’t know what to expect because of how villages are kind of depicted in films and in the media. So I wasn’t sure what to expect. When I got there, it exceeded my expectations. I had a very tranquil and peaceful experience the time I was there.  You’re also an entrepreneur. How did it all start? My company is called Be Naya Limited. I’ve few businesses under that company. I’ve got Naya Garri; I also have a honey business under that company as well. I’m about to launch something that has to do with natural herbs. I can’t disclose much about it just yet. There will be an announcement about it by the middle of the year. It is important to have multiple streams of income. Multiple source of income is very crucial for an actor. I’ve always been ambitious; I’ve always had an entrepreneurial spirit which I got from my mother and mother got it from my grandmother who got it from my great grandmother; so it runs in the family. My great grandmother always used to say to my grandmother and then to my mother that even when you are married, a woman should always have her own. So my mum instilled those values in me and that is the reason why I am the way I’m today.  Who are your greatest role models? My mum is my greatest role model. I also have other role models that are famous. But my mum represents for me a woman with strength and resilience. Apart from my mum, I love Oprah Winfrey. I think she’s very inspiring; she managed to achieve a lot in society and she never used the fact that she’s a woman as an excuse. I’m inspired by her success and she has inspired a lot of people both male and female along the way.  For your acting career, who are your role models? There are lots of great actresses that are doing very well in the industry. Rita Dominic is a lady that is doing incredibly well; she’s not just acting, she’s producing as well. She’s definitely admirable for that reason. Genevieve Nnaji is also on the same path and she’s internationally acclaimed for her work and I respect that about her also.  You’re one of the best dressed actresses in Nollywood. What inspires your style? I think it’s just my mood. There are two things that have to happen; one, if I have an event, it is important for me to stand out. I love to standout at events with my fashion. My style is classic. I love standing out in a classy way. If I have to attend a really big event, I’ll go for statement pieces. I love to wear outfits that you will not forget in a hurry. But on a day to day basis, I really love just casual stuff. I love simplicity and to be comfortable but I always wear heels as well.  Who are your greatest designers both here and abroad? In Nigeria, I really love Western Franklin. He’s a fantastic designer. There’s another one called Fablane by Derin and Wana Sambo, she’s perfect when I’ve meetings and cocktail events. Other ones I’ll like to collaborate with in future are Jewel by Lisa and Lanre Da Sliva.  What can you not do for fashion? I don’t think there’s a need for excesses like skin showing, going seminude all in the name of fashion.  You’ve been scandal-free since joining Nollywood, how have you been able to do that? I’ve been in Nollywood for eight years now. I think that’s easy; I’m never in the wrong places. I’m not usually in the environment where people will feel the need to speak negatively about me. That is how I handle myself and always maintain my dignity at all times.  What do you do with your social time? I like to go out to restaurants, explore the bars. I like to go to the cinemas and I also love traveling and go shopping.  What’s your best vacation location? The place I really loved was Abu Dhabi. I went there late last year and I really loved it; that was my first time. Another place I would love to go to is Tokyo and Cuba.  What’s your favorite food? My favorite Nigerian food is Banga soup with pounder yam.  Can you prepare it? No, I can’t but I can prepare the pounded yam.  Do you love cooking? No, I don’t but I can cook. In fact, I’m an amazing cook but I just don’t like cooking; it’s stressful.  Are you in a relationship? I’d rather not say anything on that at the moment; so no comment!  What are the qualities you look out for in your ideal man for marriage? He has to be ambitious. He has to be a gentleman, hardworking. He has to know how to make me feel special and happy and also God fearing. He has to be an amazing human being all round.  Have you ever been in love before? No, I haven’t actually. I believe it will come at some point.  But are you approachable? Do guys find it easy to come to you? Yes, I’m definitely approachable. There’s a quote by Chimamanda Adichie I love so much and it says, ‘Just because a woman is ambitious should not intimidate a man. If the man is intimidated by the woman, then he’s the kind of man she shouldn’t be with’, that’s what Chimamanda said and I totally agree with her.  You are a feminist then? No, I’m not.  Would you marry someone you’re richer than? I’m a very ambitious person and I expect that the person I’m going to be with is just as ambitious as I am or even more ambitious than me. That means the person I marry will be more successful than me ideally because I don’t intend to be the one keeping the entire home.  When in a relationship, are you the romantic type? I’m very romantic; so it’s important for me to be with a romantic person for that reason.  Who are your best wristwatch and bag designers? For wristwatch, that will be Marc Jacobs. I’m definitely a bag person and I love Salvatore Ferragamo. I love Jimmy Choo as well.
