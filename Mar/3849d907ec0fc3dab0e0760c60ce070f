…says Moses maintains retirement decision  Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, has explained the reason why the technical crew decided not to invite the national team captain, Mikel Obi, for the next two games of the team later this month – the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Seychelles and international friendly game against Egypt. While speaking with the official website of Confederation of African Football, Rohr said Mikel was not ready for the games after just returning to ac-tion for his new club Middlesbrough. “He (Mikel) has arrived in Middlesbrough recently. He told me he was not ready and needed to work after his knee injury in China,” Rohr said. “He did not play all winter either. He is not ruled out for the AFCON but could not make that match in Asaba. We will see for the future.” On Victor Moses, the former Niger national team coach said the player was still maintaining his stance on his retirement. The Chelsea loanee who made 37 appearances for the Super Eagles and won the 2013 AFCON with the national team announced his retirement immediately after the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia and has not made himself available for selection since then. The former England U-17 player is currently enjoying a new lease of life at Turkish side Fenerbahce, for whom he has scored two goals in the last six matches in the Super Lig. There was speculations recently that he might be returning to the Super Eagles but Rohr has maintained that the decision must come from the player himself. Rohr said: “I was against his international retirement and, if he changed his mind, he must tell me but I have no information about it. We’ll see.”
