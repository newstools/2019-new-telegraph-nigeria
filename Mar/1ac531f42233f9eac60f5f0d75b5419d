‘Skin’, a feature documentary produced by Nollywood actress, Beverly Naya and directed by Daniel Etim Effiong, exploring the true meaning of beauty in all complexions with emphasis on the different shades of black will be premiered today. The documentary theme centers on colourism which Beverly says, “Colourism affects both women and men in African countries, but it has negatively influenced the beauty standards associated with a woman’s ability to find success. The number of women across Africa using bleaching products has increased with 77 percent of them being Nigerian.” Speaking on the documentary sponsored by Nivea, the beautiful actress said, “ I hope I can encourage young girls, especially in our nation to practice colour acceptance and to love themselves no matter what and not to be easily enticed by what they see in the media and the films or what anyone tells them regarding what beauty is. So I hope the documentary inspires people to just love themselves as they are whatever their skin colour is.” It is set in present day Lagos, where Nollywood actress Beverly Naya goes on a journey to learn about contrasting perceptions of beauty. Through the campaign, she has been able to inspire and empower a lot of people, especially young females who feel insecure about themselves because of their skin colour. Also speaking at the press conference, organised by 100SME, director of ‘Skin’, Daniel Effiong, explained that the documentary features interviews with Eku Edewor, Hilda Dokubo, Bobrisky, Phyno, as well as school children, traders, artists, beauty entrepreneurs and sex workers and its aimed at revealing how colourism continues to shape the face of the entertainment industry in Africa. The star studded event is sponsored by Nivea and Moet and Chaddon.
