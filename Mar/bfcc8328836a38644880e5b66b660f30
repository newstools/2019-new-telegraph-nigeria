At least four people lost their lives yesterday while 12 others sustained injuries in an accident at Awka, Anambra State.
The accident, which occurred at Agu Awka close to the Government House about 1.30a.m., involved a tanker loaded with fuel and a bus carrying yam.
It was learnt that the bus rammed into the tanker coming from Onitsha and heading to Enugu. A witness said the tanker had lost control while descending the hill owing to break failure but the bus was negotiating from the Enugu-Onitsha old road and rammed into the tanker. Two people died on the spot at Agu Awka while the other two died on getting to the hospital. Other injured victims were said to be responding to treatment.
The state Police Public Relations Office (PPRO), Mr. Mohammed Haruna, confirmed the accident. The state Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), Mr. Andrew Kumajayi, said the command had in the past held meetings with heavy duty truck drivers and their union on ways to reduce accidents.
Kumajayi said the command had commenced zero tolerance for reckless driving by buses and heavy duty truck drivers.
Meanwhile, men of the state Fire Service Department in Awka were stationed at Agu Awka in event of any fire incident while efforts were being made to trans-load the fuel to another tanker.
