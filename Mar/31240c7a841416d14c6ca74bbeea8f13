Going by the display of a wife of the governorship candidates in the March 9 election, a particular state in the southern part of the country, may experience another Margaret Thatcher as First Lady by the time her husband is sworn in as governor. Like late Margaret Thatcher, the longest-serving British Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 and Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990, who was described by a Soviet journalist as “The ‘Iron Lady,” a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style, the incoming ‘First Lady’ proved beyond doubt that she might be next “Iron Lady” of Nigeria’s politics. Politricks was amazed during the governorship election by the way the wife of Governor-elect dished out instructions and gave marching orders to her spouse’s supporters on election day. She even went to the extent of blocking those who refused to obey her instruction from having access to “His Excellency.”
