In this report, AKEEM NAFIU seeks lawyers’ views on whether a tribunal is empowered to alter election results as in instance Osun case by the State Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal which declared Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke, winner of the election conducted by INEC on 22nd September, 2018  Lawyers at the weekend rose in defence of the decision of the Osun State Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal to alter final results of votes gathered by the two leading candidates in the 2018 governorship election in Osun State after voiding supplementary polls conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Two of the three members of the Osun election tribunal; Justices Peter Obiora and Adegboye Gbolagunte, had in a unanimous judgement set aside rerun election conducted by INEC in seven polling units on 27th September, 2018, for being unlawful. In the lead judgement delivered by Justice Obiora, it was held that the polls conducted in seven units was unknown to law because the Returning Officer had no power to cancel and order a rerun of an election. It was further held that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke, had established beyond reasonable doubt that INEC did not comply substantially with the Electoral Act in 17 polling units. Consequently, over 2,000 votes credited to the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate, Gboyega Oyetola were deducted from the total votes credited to them by INEC, while over 1,000 votes said to have been gathered by the PDP and its candidate, Ademola Adeleke, were also removed from the total votes. The two panelists, however, rejected the application of the PDP with regard to over-voting saying no sufficient facts have been provided by the petitioner to prove the allegation. The election of the incumbent governor of the state, Gboyega Oyetola, was subsequently annulled while INEC was directed to immediately issue certificate of return to the PDP candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke, as the elected governor of Osun <img class="size-medium wp-image-198793 alignleft" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Adeleke-Oyetola.png?resize=300%2C145&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="145" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Adeleke-Oyetola.png?resize=300%2C145&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Adeleke-Oyetola.png?w=665&amp;ssl=1 665w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1">State. “The petitioner (Mr. Adeleke) having fulfilled the constitutional requirements and scored the majority lawful vote is declared winner and returned as governor”, the two panelists held. However, in a minority judgement, the Chairman of the panel, Justice Ibrahim Sirajo, held that INEC was in order to conduct a rerun after declaring the election inconclusive at the first ballot. In dismissing the petition and upholding the election of Governor Oyetola, Justice Sirajo held that the petitioners, PDP and Adeleke, could not show how the non-compliance of non-recording in the columns of accredited votes and account of ballots in the result sheets substantially affected the final results. The judge further noted that even when non-substantial compliance affects the outcome of the election, the tribunal, by virtue of Section 140(2) of the Electoral Act, did not have the power to subtract the votes affected by the non-compliance from the scores of the candidates and announce a winner. He said the Tribunal was only empowered to nullify the results of the polling units affected by the non-compliance and order a supplementary poll. Justice Sirajo however directed his court assistants to note the submissions of the majority judgement and regard them as binding.  Tribunal The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had declared the Osun State governorship election conducted on 22nd September, 2018, inconclusive. The electoral umpire premised its decision on the fact that the margin of difference in the votes gathered by the two leading candidates was less than the total number of cancelled votes. At the end of the collation of votes after the first ballot, Senator Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) gathered 254,698 votes while Gboyega Oyetola of the All Progressive Congress (APC) had 254,345 votes in second position. The margin of difference in the votes gathered by the two candidates was 354 votes. After announcing the results, INEC’s returning officer, Joseph Fuwape, the Vice Chancellor of the Federal University of Technology, Akure, disclosed that it was impossible to name an outright winner of the election without organizing a rerun. He consequently declared the election inconclusive. “Unfortunately as the returning officer, it’s not possible to declare anybody as the clear winner of the election on the first ballot”, Fuwape said. He explained that the total registered voters in the polling units where elections were cancelled is 3,498 votes and that since that figure was higher than the difference between the votes of the leading candidates, a rerun election had to be conducted. Following that declaration, a supplementary election was conducted by INEC in seven polling units on 27th September, 2018. At the end of the election, Gboyega Oyetola of the All Progressive Congress (APC) was declared the winner and returned elected as Osun State Governor with 255,505 votes while Senator Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party had 255,023 votes. Dissatisfied with the outcome of the election, Adeleke and his party, the PDP, filed a petition at the Election Petitions Tribunal accusing the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of colluding with the All Progressives Congress (APC) to subvert his victory at the elections. They had earlier rejected the declaration by INEC that the first ballot was inconclusive saying the electoral umpire had run foul of the law by organizing a supplementary poll. Adeleke’s lawyers, led by a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Onyeachi Ikpeazu, also accused INEC of allowing the APC to manipulate voting figures in its favour.  Tribunal’s power to alter election results Issues have been made out with regard to the power of the Tribunal to alter the results of the election as was raised in the minority judgement delivered by Justice Sirajo. Some senior lawyers have also been speaking on the propriety of the decisions taken by the two other Justices which culminated in the majority judgement. The lawyers believed the Tribunal’s decision to revisit the results of the election were borne out of the voiding of the supplementary elections conducted by INEC on 27th September, 2018. According to them, in the eyes of the Tribunal, every votes cast during the rerun election are unlawful. Speaking on the issue, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Chief Mike Ahamba, disclosed that the Tribunal is empowered to alter the results of the election if it is convinced that part of it came from invalid votes. He said: “The Tribunal has power to alter election results. That is why every candidate must ensure that his or results from the base to the bottom of the electoral pyramid are intact. The results must tally or else if this was discovered by the Tribunal, it will reject such results. So, the Tribunal has the power to adjust the result if it is convinced invalid votes were part of the results.” In his own submissions, another Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Dr. Biodun Layonu, said since all the votes gathered at the rerun polls were voided by the Tribunal, it is only logical that the voided votes should be deducted from the total votes in order to know what was left. “If the law says a candidate must have majority of lawful votes to be declared the winner and the Tribunal found out that something contrary, it will take action on it. This might involve addition or subtraction of figures. “Besides, if the Tribunal is saying the rerun election should not have held, it means all the votes recorded by each of the candidates during the rerun will have to be deducted from the total votes gathered by each of the candidates. In the eyes of the Tribunal, the votes gathered by the candidates during the rerun are unlawful votes and that was why it had to remove them. “But, as far as I am concerned, the issue of whether or not the rerun should have held is more fundamental than the issue of tampering with the result”, the silk said. In his own views, a former Vice-President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Mr. Adekunle Ojo, also believed the Tribunal’s action was in order saying it has the right to either add or remove votes gathered by either of the two candidates. He said; “Yes, the Tribunal’s action is in order. It was also done in Fayemi’s case. It’s like there was a calculation and in looking at the entire process, the Tribunal had the right to either add or remove votes gathered by both candidates, especially if the votes were wrongly ascribed or wrongly deducted. “I think basically, if the judgement centered on the fact that the supplementary election was illegal, it then logically followed that whatever is ascribed to the candidate of the APC who was declared winner after the rerun should be deducted from the entire votes. “However, the judgement is not cast in iron because it was a split decision which means that it could still go either way at the appellate courts. The issue determined solely by the Tribunal was whether the rerun conducted by INEC is proper or improper and that may likely be the main issue to be looked into by the appellate courts. This has actually narrowed down the basis for anyone to appeal against the Tribunal’s ruling”. The National President of the Campaign for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR), Mr. Malachy Ugwummadu, noted that the decision of the might not be unconnected with the facts and evidences presented to it by parties in the case.
“It is the responsibility of the collation officers to understand what happened at the polling units and then declare the results in line with what they got. This is why elections are presumed to have occurred at the polling units as declared by the collation officers. “It becomes illegal when returning officers are allowed to carry out the functions of the collation officers. This was the basis upon which the Tribunal did what it did. If the Tribunal has found that what happened was not done by authorized officers, it then falls on members to determine the correct thing that ought to be done. “This showed that the Tribunal has found a credible basis for annulling the declared election and there was no way they could have ascertain those figures. There’s no other way they could do so except by looking at the evidence before them and do the proper calculation before arriving at that decision. So, it is difficult to fault them. “However, it is not the Electoral Act that empowers the Tribunal because it is a court. The Tribunal is guided by a set of rules beyond the Electoral Act, which is a statute that regulates the conduct of the election. The Tribunal is a properly constituted judicial body and it was guided by the Constitution, evidence before it as well as the jurisprudence and equity of the law,” Ugwummadu said.
