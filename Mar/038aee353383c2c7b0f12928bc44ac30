A 53-year-old businessman, Aci Blackson, yesterday appeared before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court over alleged theft of N1.7 million.
Blackson, who resides at Ikeja area of Lagos, is facing a two-count charge of obtaining under false pretences and stealing. The prosecutor, ASP Peter Nwangwu, told the court that the defendant committed the offence sometimes in February 2018 at Oregun, Ikeja, Lagos. Nwangwu said that the defendant obtained N1.7 million under the pretext of helping to procure a Toyota Corolla car for the complainant, Mr. Sunday Michael.
He said: “The defendant fraudulently obtained the money from the complainant and promised to buy the car, but failed to do so.
“Blackson converted the money to his personal use and absconded. “All efforts made by the complainant to get the defendant to refund the money proved abortive.” Nwangwu said the offence contravened Sections 287 and 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Section 287, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), provides a three-year jail term for offenders. The Chief Magistrate, Yewande Aje-Afunwa, granted the defendant a N400,000 bail with two responsible sureties in like sum. Aje-Afunwa said that the sureties must be blood relations of the defendant.
She said that the sureties should show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State government.
The chief magistrate adjourned the case till May 5 for mention.
