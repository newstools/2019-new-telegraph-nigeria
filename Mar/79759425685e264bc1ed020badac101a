 Tume raised his eyebrows and squinted at Tami, willing her to communicate with him in sign language. But Tami stared at him, eyes misty with tears. He could read nothing from her blank stare. His heart fluttered and he had a sudden headache and swayed. He wanted to bolt, but his legs felt like jelly. “Tume!” his wife shouted and his heart missed several beats. He felt as if he was choking. “Tume!” His wife called again and stared at him. His eyes looked haunted. He swayed and leaned on his wife and they walked to the couch. “What’s the problem?” Tami, who had stopped crying, asked as she moved to the couch where Tume was sitting, immobile. Nessa was distraught. “Baby, speak to me! What’s happening to you? Are you alright? Tami, get him a glass of water,” she told her friend. “He needs a doctor,” Tami suggested. “Get him water first,” Nessa said. Tami disappeared into the kitchen and when she returned with a glass of water, Tume was looking better. He accepted the glass of water and drank it. He noted that whatever the women were crying over had been forgotten. He sighed: he almost had a heart attack! “You have to see a doctor. You’re not feeling fine,” Nessa told him. “I’m okay dear. I’m cool. Been working too hard lately but believe me, I’m okay,” he said with a smile. Really, he was okay but didn’t want the ladies to know. He needed to understand the situation first. If it required accepting to go to the hospital, he might just do that. A few days in the hospital would certainly calm the storm building around him. Moreover, he wouldn’t lose <img class="size-medium wp-image-195120 alignleft" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sweet-smelling-evil-2.png?resize=300%2C146&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="146" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sweet-smelling-evil-2.png?resize=300%2C146&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Sweet-smelling-evil-2.png?w=666&amp;ssl=1 666w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1">anything business-wise, because the ongoing general elections had lulled everything. He prayed that the governorship election and its aftermath wouldn’t be as bloody as the presidential. He stretched out on the couch and squinted as he searched their faces, trying to read their minds. But the only expression on their faces was concern. They were worried. He closed his eyes. It had been a very busy day and he was tired. He yawned a number of times as weariness washed over him. He closed his eyes and relaxed. In no time, sleep took over.
Nessa and Tami stared at him, then at each other, puzzled. “He scared the hell outta me a while ago,” his wife told her friend. “I was scared too,” her friend replied. Of a truth, Tami was scared. Tume wasn’t just her best friend’s hubby, he was responsible for her own pregnancy. She winced as she recalled how it all started. That was months ago, after the doctors had placed her best friend, Nessa, on bed rest in an attempt to save her pregnancy. Each time Nessa became pregnant, there was always a complication and she would lose it. Tume and Nessa had been married for years and still had no child. The doctors told them she needed one hundred per cent rest. Tume would do anything for them to have a baby. He banished her to her room. Once in a while, Nessa would need her hubby’s warmth but Tume wouldn’t oblige her. It got to a point that she would beg for a kiss. ***** Tami was a regular visitor to Nessa’s home. Really, Nessa needed her because she wasn’t going out often; so she popped in most evenings on her way from work and spent most weekends in Nessa’s house. Nessa had had reasons to express her fears about Tume’s nonchalance to romance. Of course, Tami had an idea of what was happening outside Nessa’s home. She had seen Tume with ladies a number of times. He seemed to favour the Ikeja red light district. She decided to take the issue up with her friend’s husband. On hindsight, she wished she never did. She recalled the day she discussed it with Tume. It was a Wednesday evening and she had gone on a dinner date with a colleague. The dinner wasn’t particularly a success because she was still smarting from her last relationship. It was almost a year after she broke up with Dele. Dele was a player but at the point she met him, she was too sad to notice anything. Her fiancé was involved in an auto crash and he didn’t survive it. She was heartbroken and mourned him for so long. Nessa and Tume talked her into giving another man a chance, after four years. That was when Dele came by. They dated for two years before she realised that Dele was a player. She broke down in tears anytime she remembered their final quarrel. She had asked Dele about Iyabo. It was then that Dele shocked her with the news that he was married and that his wife and two children were based in the UK, which explained his frequent ‘business trips’ to Britain. She shook off the thought. She needed to talk to Tume. If she did her homework very well, he would visit the guesthouse this evening. He did! ***** Tume drove towards the gate of the guesthouse with the young lady seated beside him. He was in high spirit. He called his companion ‘the temptress’. She had an uncanny way of getting him restless down there and she knew the exact pressure to apply anywhere to calm him… Of course, a storm was already gathering around his groin. “Today is gonna be a bang,” he muttered to himself as he eased his treasured SUV towards the gate. “Sorry wifey, I can’t hold on for so long. Don’t wanna get rusty or old,” he hummed and glanced at the beauty sitting beside him with her eyes closed. She wasn’t sleeping for she had her left hand draped over his headrest and was caressing his neck.
Tami crossed the road and walked towards them. As Tume honked for the gateman, she gently tapped on his window. Tume stared at her in bewilderment; he opened his mouth and closed it without uttering a sound. The gateman had thrown the gate wide open. The young lady opened the passenger’s door, got out of the car and scurried away.
Tami went to the passenger’s side and entered the car. Tume engaged the gear in reverse mode and drove back into the street. “Look Tami, this never happened. PLEASE. I couldn’t hold it any longer. Please. I am…please don’t tell my wife. You know the challenge at home. I’m a man and I need to let off steam once in a while. I promise I’ll try not to allow it happen again…” Tume was incoherent.
He looked down at his trousers and noticed a wet patch spreading slowly and looked at Tami whose eyes had followed his gaze. “Tume, your wife needs you more at home now. She doesn’t go out and she’s always lonely. The best you can do for her is to get home early. She’s complaining,” she told him gently. Tume promised to be a better companion to his wife and life continued. Tami still visited most evenings and stayed until very late one evening. Tume took her home. As they were driving through Allen Avenue in Ikeja, Lagos, he ogled at the ladies hawking their ‘wares’ by the side of the road.
Tami coughed discreetly and he turned to her. “You know I’m on sabbatical at home. As a human being, I need to let off steam once in a while. If I can’t do that, I can at least feed my eyes. I have blood running in my veins…,” he said apologetically and they chatted about politics and sundry issues till they got to Tami’s house. The building was in darkness. It was not surprising because power supply in that area was a mess. Everyone had resorted to self help. Noise from generators was deafening. Tume went in with her to help put on her generator. When he did, Tami turned on the switches but no light. She fished out a torch from her bedroom. Tume fiddled with the main switch for sometime before the light came on. He was sweating by now. “Thank you, Tume. Nessa is right. You are really handy in the house,” she said. “And what else has your friend said about me? You women love gossip,” he replied. A drink wasn’t out of place and he accepted one. Tami turned on the television and they sat on the couch and watched a Nollywood film showing on one of the channels. There was an awkward moment when Ramsey Nouah reached out and grabbed Genevieve Nnaji in a romantic scene. “Ah, it’s almost time for the 10pm news,” Tume observed. He loved the news at 10. So, instead of leaving, he decided to wait till after the news. “Where’s the remote control?” He picked it and searched the channels. Tami’s mobile phone beeped on the table. She reached for it and her hand brushed his lap. She withdrew her hand immediately. Tume picked the phone and stretched it towards her. But instead of giving it to her, he grabbed her hand and drew her to his chest in an embrace. She pushed him away and stood up but he grabbed her left hand and she landed on his laps. He held her tightly while she squirmed. “Tami, please help me. Your friend can’t help me now. Please…” he whispered into her ears… ******* Let’s continue this journey on Sunday! •Send your observations to: julietbumah@gmail.co
