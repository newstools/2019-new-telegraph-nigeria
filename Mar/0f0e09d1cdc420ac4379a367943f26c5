Nigeria’s junior international, Umar Sadiq, has criticised exboss Steven Gerrard‘s management technique. He also says the Ibrox side still owes him money. The 22-year-old striker started just one match during during his extremely disappointing loan spell from Roma during the first-half of the campaign, before being sent back to the Italian club. He’s been sent out on another loan to Perugia, where his form seems to have improved somewhat, but Umar still has a bee in his bonnet when it comes to his failed spell in Scotland. He told the Sunday Post: “Gerrard proved to be very different from what I believed he would be. “At the beginning, I didn’t know anything about the Rangers move. The negotiations were all between Roma and my representatives. “And when my agent told me about it, I expressed my doubts. “I wasn’t sure it was the right thing to do. But he kept arguing it would be good for me and my career. “Then it was Steven Gerrard himself who convinced me.” Umar, who featured prominently in Nigeria’s team that won bronze at the Rio 2016 Olympics, continued: “He phoned me three or four times, complimenting me and saying he’d back me to be a success. “It made me feel important and convinced me to agree to the loan switch. “At that point, I knew the club the same way football fans all over the world know Rangers – for its history and the passion of its fans. “But when I arrived, I didn’t even have any time to settle down before they brought in another striker, Kyle Lafferty. “That was when the problems started, and my situation soon degenerated into a real nightmare. “All of a sudden, I was told that I could not use the first-team dressingroom any more. Instead I had to go change with the kids. “Then, after a few days, I was also forbidden to park my car inside the training centre. “I felt humiliated and kept asking what was the reason for the change of attitude. But I never received any answer.”
