 Super Falcons coach, Thomas Dennerby, has read the riot act to his players as he charges them to improve on their performance if they are to make any reasonable impact at the fast approaching FIFA Women World Cup in France. The team just finished participating at an invitational championship in Cyprus where they finished seventh after losing to Austria and Belgium while defeating Slovakia and Thailand. “It’s been a little bit of up and down as we’ve been very good in periods and weak in some,” Dennerby told Goal. “Overall, we have a really good defence in open play but there is a need to be more stable on set pieces defensively. “We also have good quick and counter-attacks but need to work with build up from the midfield to have more variation in attacks. “We defeated Slovakia and should have scored more goals despite the incidents in the match. We won 3-0 against Thailand and were very stable. “We equally had a strong performance against Austria even though we lost badly due to the early red card. We had a weak game against Belgium. “All the players need to keep improving. “We still need to improve in all departments -both defensively and offensively. We need to link it all together.” The African queens have now played six games so far this year ahead of their preparations for the Women’s World Cup in France and they are expected to regroup early next month.
