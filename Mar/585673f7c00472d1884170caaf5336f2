An Ilorin Magistrate Court on Thursday remanded a man, Akeem Jiddah, in prison, accused of defrauding one Tolu Bankola of N1.8 million. The prosecutor, Insp. Folorunsho Zacheaus, told the court that the accused fraudulently collected N1.8 million from Bankola under the pretext of selling 12 plots of land to him at Ogele via Eiyenkorin in Asa Local Government Area of Kwara State. He said the defendant presented a fake land transfer agreement to the complainant, who only realised that he was duped when the labourers he assigned to work on the land were chased away. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. The prosecutor said the defendant was brought before the court on a two-count charge of criminal breach of trust and cheating contrary to sections 312 and 322 of the penal code. He prayed the court to remand the accused in prison cus-tody pending the completion of investigation. The Magistrate, Ibrahim Dasuki, ordered the remand of the accused at Okekura Prison Yard, Ilorin and adjourned the case until March 15, for mention.
