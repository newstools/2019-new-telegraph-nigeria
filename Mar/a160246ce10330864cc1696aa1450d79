Imo state Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Prof. Francis Ezeonu has said that the nation’s electoral system had come to a point it urgently needed to embrace electronic voting system with a view to eliminating various deficiencies of the present system. Ezeonu, who spoke during an interactive election review session with newsmen in Owerri, the Imo state capital also noted that trust was the highest currency in elections in any democratic system. He said: “The end of one election cycle begins the new cycle. It had been a challenging and demanding process. Where we were wrong, we admitted we were wrong and where we were right, we insisted we were right. There have been a lot of lessons to learn and we have noted them and will escalate them to the Commission. “But honestly, where we are today as a nation, I think what we need is the electronic voting system. We have witnessed the level of desperation with which politicians approach elections and we must move towards reducing to the barest minimum, the interference of human elements in the election process. “It will eliminate thuggery, voter-intimidation, ballot box snatching, ballot stuffing, doctoring of results and other unpredictable impunities at collation centres. “We must begin to decapitalize political offices, most of which are rather too juicy, if we must be able to neutralize the desperation of politicians who are willing to kill and maim people to get into political offices. It may not be automatic, but we must keep pressing toward the mark.”
