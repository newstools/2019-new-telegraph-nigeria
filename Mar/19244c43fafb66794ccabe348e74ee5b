The Secretary to Uzo -Uwani Local Government Area of Enugu state, Dr. Nnamdi Ogueche has been murdered by suspected Fulani Herdsmen. Ogueche was killed on Wednesday along Ezeagu – Umulokpa axis at about 5 pm by the herdsmen between Olo and Umulokpa. According to a source, “I arrived at the scene of the tragedy a couple of minutes after the gory incidence”. The gunmen reportedly opened fire on a vehicle conveying the deceased and two other persons leading to stampede and tension while the occupants of the vehicle jumped out in different directions for safety. The assailants were however said to have pursued the council scribe shooting him in the process. It was said that the herders attacked them and shot Nnamdi Ogueche on the head. He hailed from Adaba and was on his way back to Enugu after attending a meeting at Adaba. The meeting was between the Adaba people and the herdsmen. The discussion was on the menace of the Fulani herdsmen in Adaba. They were three people in the taxicab but he was the only person shut. The two roads leading to Umulokpa (Nkporogu / Uvuru / Ukpata road and 9th mile / Ezeagu road) have become terribly risky to ply, according to indigenes of the area. Contacted for comment over the killing, the chairman Uzo-Uwani local government area Mr. Fidelis Ani confirmed the killing of the council scribe along Olo community road while returning from a peace meeting, adding that immediate cause of the killing has not been ascertained but the entry has been lodged at Ezzeagu police division at Aguobu Owa for investigations. Enugu State commissioner of police Sulaiman Balarabe who confirmed the incident during a press briefing Thursday said there was an ambush against the deceased. The CP, however, refused to confirm the involvement of herdsmen until after investigations. Ends
