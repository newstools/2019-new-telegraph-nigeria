LaLiga table toppers and defending champions, Barcelona, will on Saturday, seek to continue their march to yet another title when they take on relegationthreatened Rayo Vallecano at the Camp Nou. The match is one of Week 27 matches to air live exclusively to GOtv MAX subscribers. The match will be air at 6.30 pm on SuperSport Select 4 (channel 34). Barcelona is currently on a hot streak; last week, the defending champions defeated their fierce rivals, Real Madrid, 3-0 away from home in the El Clasico, following an earlier 1-0 victory over the same opponents in the Copa del Rey semi-final, also at the Santiago Bernabeau. Barcelona will hope to win their 19th match of the season and maintain a seven-point lead over second-placed Atletico Madrid. Vallecano could not have had more difficult opponents after the home battering in the hands of Girona in their last match, their fifth loss in as many matches. They have also conceded 45 goals, an unwanted tally the rampaging Barcelona frontline of Lionel Messi Luis Suarez and Ousmane Dembele are well placed to increase. Second-placed Atletico Madrid is in action on Saturday when they host 11thplaced Leganes in what is expected to be a tough game. The match will be live at 4:15 pm on SuperSport Select 4.
