Members of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) attached to the Lagos State Police Command have arrested two suspects for allegedly robbing, posing as buyers in order to rob a phone dealer at the Ikotun-Egbe area of the metropolis of two android phones.
The police explained that suspects ordered the two android phones online, worth N283,000 respectively and waited for the delivery man.
The state Commissioner of Police, Zubairu Muazu, explained that the suspects ordered the phones online and asked the dealer to come and deliver them.
He said: “They said that when he comes to deliver the phones, that is when they would pay. The dealer didn’t know that the acclaimed buyer belonged to a gang of armed robbers. The victim was arrested by three armed men who had a standby motorcycle. The dealer was shot on the thigh and the two phones snatched from him.
“On receiving the report, SARS operatives swung into action. On sighting the operatives, one of the robbers fled with the operational motorcycle and the two phones. He was, however, out of luck as policemen pursued and caught him. The suspects were searched and a cut-to-size triple-barrelled gun was recovered from them.
“The two suspects, Obinna Anyanwu and Ernest Chinonso, have been arrested. During interrogation, the suspects confessed to the crime.”
