A socio-cultural group, Ochetoha ‘K’ Idoma, formerly known as Idoma National Forum (INF) has called on the police to carry out a thorough investigation into the killing of an Idoma indigene, Mr. Ochigbo Ogar Jumbo, an Assistant Superintendent of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). Jumbo was allegedly killed by policemen on traffic control in Abuja. A statement by the group’s president, Amali Adoya Amali, yesterday, condemned the killing, saying it was sad. The statement read: “We are shocked that Jumbo was in uniform and was conveying his family members in his vehicle when policemen on traffic control duty around Nyanya area of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, on Wednesday, March 20, killed him. “Now, where is the esprit-d -corps among service personnel? The least acceptable standard is that the Nigeria Police should immediately arrest the policemen alleged to be involved in the dastardly act and commence internal disciplinary actions against them, preparatory to appropriate legal actions against them in the court of law to ensure that justice is done. “This extra-judicial killing must stop. Punishment for traffic offences should not be death. Therefore, example must be made of the officers to serve as deterrence to others. “We reject in its entirety, the claim by the Force Public Relations Officer, ACP Frank Mba, that the deceased slumped and died during interrogation. Therefore, we request that a proper autopsy be conducted. We commiserate with Jumbo’s family and call for calm among our people.”
