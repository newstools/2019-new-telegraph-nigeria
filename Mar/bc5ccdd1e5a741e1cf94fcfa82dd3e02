Residents of Aba, the commercial hub of Abia State, have expressed fear over the continued attack on security personnel which again has led to the death of a police inspector. The residents also expressed fear over the constant robbery attacks on warehouse owners which they said were becoming alarming and could cripple businesses in the city. A mobile police sergeant was recently killed around a popular hotel on Azikiwe Road by East Street. Barely a few days later, a similar incident occurred at the same axis. This time around, the police inspector was killed by a group of yetto- be identified gunmen who attacked one of the warehouses in Aba. The police officer, according to sources at the Aba Area Command, was known among his colleagues as Nma Agha (Battle Sword). It was learnt that before the incident, the gunmen had gone to a warehouse located on ever-busy Clifford Road by East Street where they robbed and carted away huge sums of cash from the owners.The gunmen reportedly shot a worker at the warehouse who was later rushed to a private hospital at East Street where he was said to be receiving medical attention. The hoodlums had finished robbing the warehouse and were on their way when they sighted the police officer and his team who were said to have gone for another duty not too far from the scene of the incident. It was learnt that the policemen, who were apparently taken by surprise, could not respond to the robbersâ€™ shooting. When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr. Geoffrey Ogbonna, confirmed the death of the police officer, adding that investigation into the matter had commenced.
