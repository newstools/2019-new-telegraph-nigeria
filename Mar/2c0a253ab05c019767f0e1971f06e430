 Consumers’ cooperatives in the South-East and South-South geopolitical zones have reiterated their call on the Federal Government to ban the importation of palm oil and others things the country has the capacity to produce locally, saying that will encourage local producers and farmers and boost domestic production. This was the highpoint of a recent four-day capacity building workshop organised by the cooperatives in Awka with the resolve to develop cooperative industry in the two zones. Arising from the workshop held at the Federal Cooperative College, Oji River, Enugu State, participants agreed that there was need for the Federal Government to create a separate ministry of Cooperative, Rural Development and Poverty Reduction. The participants noted that the establishment of Cooperative and Commerce Bank has become necessary for a vital development of the cooperative industry in the two zones. They said this would allow for easy access to funds for the members. “Federal Government should establish Marketing Boards that will put in place price control mechanism to reduce waste and regulate cost of produce, “ he said. There is also the need to reduce monopoly of agencies or middle men,” they said.  They were of the opinion that cooperative education, especially among the rural farmers should be vigorously pursued by the state directors of cooperative. They also want the Federal Government to encourage the services of professional bodies like the Institute of Cooperative Professionals of Nigeria (ICOPRON), “which should be allowed to be registered.”
