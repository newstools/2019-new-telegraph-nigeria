Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, has offered N5 million to any person or persons with information on those behind the assassination of the Head of Nursing Services at the Federal Psychiatric Hospital, Enugu, Mrs. Maria Amadi. Ugwuanyi made the offer when members of the National Association of Nigerian Nurses and Midwives, Enugu State Chapter, accompanied by Joint Health Sector Union and Association of Resident Doctors, visited him at the Government House, Enugu, to seek his intervention towards the unraveling of the assassins. The governor who disclosed that the money will be made available immediately to the State Commissioner of Police, Suleiman Balarabe, stressed that it will go a long way in ensuring that those who perpetrated the dastardly act were apprehended and made to face the wrath of the law. Ugwuanyi condemned the unfortunate incident and promised “to get to the root of this crime.” He also commiserated with the families of the deceased and her colleagues, saying: “I am sincerely saddened by the gruesome murder of your colleague. I share in your grief. It is a solemn moment for all right-thinking persons”. The governor, who dis-closed that he had made several interventions to ensure peace in the hospital, said he didn’t know that the crisis in the establishment had taken a new dimension. He said: “To tell you that we are serious, I am making available the sum of N5 million to the Commissioner of Police, Enugu State Command for any person or persons that will provide information about the people that killed this nursing officer
