The Controller of Nigerian Prison Service (NPS), Enugu State Command, Mr. Ndubuisi Ogbodo yesterday called on outgoing 8th National Assembly to ensure that Prison Reform Act before it was passed before its tenure expired in June. Speaking in an exclusive chat with New Telegraph at the end of his quarterly visitations to prison formations under his command in Enugu, Ogbodo said that the Prison Reform Act when passed and signed into law, would bring about improvement in the mandate of the Service as well as change the name from Nigerian Prison Service to Nigerian Correctional Service. The State Controller of Prison, however, lauded effort and innovations brought about by the current Controller-General of Prisons, Alhaji Ja’Afaru Ahmed in terms of improved educational, health and correctional facilities and programmes within the prisons. He said: “What we are now trying to do is if the National Assembly will be kind enough before the end of the 8th National Assembly, to pass the comprehensive Prison Reform Act. That will help us a lot because there are some Awaiting trial persons that have stayed in prison up to 10 years and by law they are presumed innocent until they are convicted.”
