Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has asked the Court of Appeal, Abuja division to reverse majority judgment of the state GovernorshipElectionPetition TribunaldeliveredonMarch22 which nullified his governorship victory in the election. The tribunal had by a majority judgment delivered by two of its three members, voided Oyetola’s election and declared Prince Ademola Adeleke of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) winner of the governorship election just as it asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to issue a certificate of return to the PDP’s candidate. In a 39-ground notice of appeal filed on 26th March, 2019 by his team of lawyers, led by Wole Olanipekun (SAN), Oyetola faulted the majority judgment delivered by Justices Peter Obiora and Ayinla Gbolagunte on the grounds that it was perverse, replete with contradictions and not supported by evidence led by the petitioners. Besides, Oyetola further submitted that his appeal was against the entire majority judgment, except where the tribunal held that it lacked jurisdiction to set aside INEC’s guidelines that allegation of over voting was not proved as the petitioners did not prove voided votes and other parts of thejudgmentwherethetribunal agreed with their arguments. On ground one, Oyetola contended that majority judgment was a nullity because it was written and delivered by Justice Obiora “who did not participate in all the proceedings of the tribunal and who was not present when all the witnesses gave evidence.” Meanwhile, PDP Campaign Organisation yesterday affirmed that no amount of antics and conspiratorial move of the APC would save Oyetola from being booted out of power. In a statement signed by its Director-General, Akogun ‘Lere Oyewumi, the group contended that the judgement restoring Adeleke’s mandate was valid and lawful. It reads: “It could be seen from evidence and cross-examinations throughout the duration of the hearing that the usurpers are jittery and desperate over the restoration of people’s mandate.”
