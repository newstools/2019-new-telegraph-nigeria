Bauchi State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has called on the electorate to come out en masse to cast their votes in the forthcoming governorship rerun election that would take place in Tafawa Balewa Local Government and some polling units in 15 affected local government areas of the state.  The call was made by Deputy Director, Bauchi State APC Campaign Council, Alhaji Aminu Mohammed Danmaliki, while interacting with newsmen. Danmalikii, who was hopeful that the bye-election would favour the party, having won majority of the state assembly elections in the March 9 Governorship and House of Assembly elections.  He said: “We once again call on the electorate to remain committed, resolute and supportive of the APC as the party of the moment, not to think of retarding the wheel of progress by retreating to the old crew that many of the states are now struggling to move out of to the Next Level,” he said. Danmaliki denied the allegation by the PDP that Governor Mohammed Abubakar ordered thugs to disrupt the collation of the result in Tafawa Balewa Local Government that had led to its cancellation.  According to him, “The APC hold no malice against anyone and respect the opinion of electorate to make their choice, but wish to add that the good citizens of Bauchi State, especially the electorate in the affected areas of cancellation should see reason to support APC to keep Bauchi State in the main stream of Nigerian politics as we are being ushered in into the next level under President Muhammadu Buhari’s watch in which a lot of transformational programmes were expected to be bankrolled immediately.”
