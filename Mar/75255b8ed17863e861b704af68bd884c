Nigeria has suffered 257 ruptures and breaches on its pipeline network across the country in just one month. This is despite a surge in pipeline surveillance investments including the $18.48 million contract for the surveillance of the 87-kilometre Trans-Forcados Pipeline (TFP) to Ocean Marine Solution Limited on September 26, 2018. The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which declared in a statement yesterday that it suffered this “whopping 34 percentage point,” in one month, noted that it “appears to be no let-up in the activities of vandals who in December last year pushed pipeline breaches across the country.” The upward swing in the breaches, which was captured in the corporation’s Monthly Financial and Operations Report for December 2018, shows that within the period, 257 pipeline points were vandalized, out of which one pipeline point failed to be welded and six pipeline points were ruptured. “NNPC recorded 197 breaches on its pipelines in November last year,” the corporation spokesman, Ndu Ughamadu, said. Ibadan-Ilorin, Mosimi- Ibadan, and Atlas Cove-Mosimi network accounted for 90, 69 and 57 compromised points respectively or approximately 34 per cent, 26 per cent and 22 per cent of the vandalized points respectively. Aba-Enugu pipeline link accounted for seven per cent, with other locations accounting for the remaining 11 per cent of the pipeline breaks. Despite the activities of the pipeline vandals, the NNPC said it continued to diligently monitor the daily stock of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), otherwise called petrol, to achieve smooth distribution of petroleum products and zero fuel queues across the nation. It disclosed that 1.8 billion litres of PMS, translating to 58.17m litres/ day were supplied for the month. Overall, during the month under review, 1.96 billion litres of white products (petrol, diesel and kerosene) were distributed and sold by NNPC Downstream subsidiary, Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC), compared with 1.09 billion litres in the market in the November 2018. This comprised 1.94 billion litres of PMS, 0.007 billion litres of kerosene and 0.014 billion litres of diesel. Total sale of white products for the period, December 2017 to December 2018,stood at 21.84 billion litres and PMS accounted for 20.17 billion litres or 92.36 per cent. In terms of value, N241.46 billion was made on the sale of white products by PPMC in December 2018, compared to N146.56 billion sales in November 2018. Total revenues generated from the sales of white products for the period December 2017 to December 2018 stood at N2,778.32 billion, with PMS contributing about 89.63 per cent of the total sales with a value of N2,490 billion. NNPC said that despite the disturbing reports of breaches on its assets, the corporation on the whole posted a positive outlook in December 2019. The Monthly Financial and Operations Report said NNPC posted trading surplus of N12.13 billion in December last year, a leap from recent past performances.
