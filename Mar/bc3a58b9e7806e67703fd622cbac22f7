The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)’s gubernatorial returning officer in Kano State, Prof. Balarabe Shehu, yesterday declared Governor Umar Abdullahi Ganduje of the All Progressives Congress (APC) winner of the governorship election in the state. Ganduje scored 1,033,695 votes to defeat his closest challenger, Abba Kabir Yusuf of the Peoples Demorcatic Party (PDP) who polled 1,024,713. The margin between Ganduje and his PDP’s Abba stood at 8,902 votes. Announcing the results, Shehu said the elections had a total number of registered voters of 5,423,929, while accredited voters stood at 2,269,305. Similarly, he said the total valid votes stood at 2,191,535 and rejected votes was 50,861 while the total votes casts was 2,242,396. Earlier, Ganduje had won the supplementary election held on Saturday with 45,876 votes against the PDP’s 10,239 votes; making him coast to victory in the most crisis-prone election in the state. The rerun election was conducted at 28 local government areas of the state, which has a total registered voters of 131,073 and accredited voters of 57,777. Announcing the results of the rerun results, Shehu said the total valid votes stood at 56,407 while total votes casts was 57,507. However, there was a mild drama between PDP agents, led by a former Secretary to the State Government, Suleiman Bichi and APC agents, led by Senator Barau Jibrin, when they engaged in verbal attack and calling of names against each other. Bichi said what happened was nothing but a sham and comedy, which would never be accepted by the PDP. He insisted that there was no election in Kano because thugs took over the events. Another PDP agent and a former commissioner in the cabinet of Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso, Yusuf Dambatta, described INEC as an institution of thuggery promotion. But Senator Jibrin said the attitude of the PDP agents was nothing but a clear display of barbaric tendencies, which should be rejected by all. He said the ideal things that could be done by the PDP if not satisfied with the elections was to approach Election Petitions Tribunal, rather that engaging in a show of shame. It would be recalled that the governorship election was earlier declared inconclusive following the high number of cancellation of votes as a result of violence and over-voting. According to the collation officer, the total number of votes cancelled – 128,572 – during the earlier election which led to the declaration of the poll as inconclusive was beyond the margin between the PDP candidate who was leading with 26,000 votes and that of the APC candidate. Kabir had 1,014,474 against Ganduje who garnered 987,819 votes in the March 9 election.
