The Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday debunked rumours that the All Progressives Congress (APC) led the Federal Government agreed to give out Abia and some other states to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in return for votes from the February 23 presidential election.  Osinbajo, who was in Aba for a Town Hall Meeting, said such rumours were mere propaganda and should be disregarded by everyone. He added that Abia was important to APC and would be claimed through the ballot by the grace of God.  The vice-president, who was answering questions from Abia people, urged them to troop out on Saturday, March 9 to sack the PDP government, which he said had left the state underdeveloped for 16 years.  Most of the questions thrown at the vice-president demanded that he cleared the air on the rumours that his constant visit to Abia meant alliance had been formed with the PDP, that his absence in the APC Abia rally connoted support for PDP as alleged. Others questions include that; whenever he visited Abia only PDP members were there to meet him.  The questions of Islamisation and alleged hatred for Ndigbo by the president were also raised. Answering their questions, the vice-president said: “Abia made a historic contribution in our election as we got 25 per cent votes. We know it was not all our votes that were counted. Come March 9, we shall prove that Abia is APC. “Abia deserves to benefit from the centre. There’s no reason for Abia to play opposition politics. By the grace of God, Abia shall join the centre on Saturday.  “That I didn’t attend the Abia APC rally in Aba had nothing to do with any agreement. It is because I cannot be with the president at a certain location at the same time for security reasons. I can only attend if it was in the South West because I’m from there.
