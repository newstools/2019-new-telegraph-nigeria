…arrests 115 motorcycles, riders  Lagos State Task Force has impounded 115 motorcycles belonging to Gokada, an on-demand motorbike hailing service and other commercial motorcyclists for flouting the 2012 Road Traffic Law.
The task force also directed owners/operators of commercial ‘Gokada’ and ‘Maxokada’ to immediately comply with the Lagos State Road Traffic Law of 2012 to avoid frequent arrests. Speaking during an enforcement operation on motorcyclists operating on restricted routes, its Chairman, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi, said the motorcyclists were apprehended for taking one-way around Ikeja, Ojota, and Maryland.
Egbeyemi said out of 115 motorcycles impounded during the enforcement operation, 23 were branded commercial ‘Gokada and Maxokada’. He said the activities of the newly branded commercial motorcycle operators were illegal, adding that many of them were operating without valid documentation from government.
The task force chairman disclosed that, in accordance, with the law no commercial motorcycle operator was allowed to operate around 475 restricted routes, including highways and bridges across the state.
He said: “Government enjoined members of the public to henceforth desist from patronising commercial motorcyclists on all restricted routes as passengers are as well liable for prosecutions. “It was an eye-sore seeing operators of these newly branded commercial motorcycles (Gokada/Maxokada) competing for right of ways with motorists on highways and bridges across the state.” Egbeyemi, however, said the state Commissioner of Police, Zubairu Muazu, had directed that 10 arrested riders be immediately charged to court for prosecution.
One of the ‘Gokada’ riders, who claimed to be paying N3,000 per day to company, said they were not aware of documentations with the government.
Another rider, Mr. Adebayo Adeniran, said he collected one of the newly branded commercial motorcycles ‘Maxokada’ on higher purchase from the management after he presented a guarantor.
