A group, Cultural and Societal Value for Development Initiatives (CSV4DI), has asked President Muhammadu Buhari, to exercise sufficient political will along with other leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to make lasting changes in the political orientation of the country during the second term in office. Specifically, the Ilorin, Kwara State-based group wants President Buhari to muster the political courage to drastically reduce the security votes currently being enjoyed by many political office holders and also undertake a constitutional review that will change the current sharing formula of the federal revenue. According to a statement issued by the group, in Ilorin, the group noted that President Buhari needs to be assertive in his second term and implement such drastic changes to save the nation’s resources from being routinely plundered under the guise of security votes, a development that has been in existence for long without meeting the real security needs of the people. The statement signed by the Chairman, Prof. Samuel Ibiyemi, and the Secretary, Gabriel Olaoye, also canvassed a reduction in the take-home of federal legislators, saying whatever is saved from such meassures can be easily used to augment the payment of an even much enhanced minimum wage to civil servants without an increase in the Value Added Tax (VAT). The statement reads: “We believe the President must not miss the opportunity for these critical reviews; they are the basic things he can do to leave Nigeria in a better state when he will be stepping down in May 2023. “If he can do these three things, that is, reduce what our governors and some other political office holders take as security votes, reduce the amount of money being spent on federal legislators and review the federal allocation formula to favour the local governments more, then he would have given Nigeria a sure foundation. “He will not need to be afraid of what happens after his departure from office in 2023. The beginning of a new term, with the federal legislative houses hosting many green horn lawmakers, is a bright opportunity to launch the kind of reform that will make that level of political leaders truly amenable to the public good.
