Organisers of Gidi Fest have revealed that this year’s event will be going back to where it took off from originally.
Speaking on behalf of the organisers at the unveiling of headlining artistes for the sixth edition of the event which represents urban youth culture and encompasses music, art, food, games, and travels, Chin Okeke said the exciting thing about this edition of the event is that it would be promoting the future of African music.
“When we started we couldn’t do big names; Gidi Fest didn’t grow based on big names, it was based on experience, and how people identified with the platform and what it represented. I think we are still one of the few platforms where people buy their ticket not necessarily because of the artistes, but because of the experience they know they will get when they come to Gidi Fest.”
Speaking on the importance of discovering Africa’s future talents, Okeke said “I do a lot of work in the UK and US, and the question in the last few months has been who is next, what is next because all we see is the top three, top four. So, we are here, but where is the next generation of artistes? Someone asked me why I seem to do shows with unknown or new artistes and I say somebody has to help. I want to be a part of the journey to when they become a Wizkid, they become a Davido. I used to be an A&R manager and for me that development is important.”
Themed Your Voice Your Choice, unveiled as the first line-up of headlining artistes for the event slated for Saturday, April 20, are acts such as Wande Coal, Patoranking, Niniola, and Teni The Entertainer, Moonchild Sanelly and DJ Neptune.
Others are Lax, Zlatan Ibile, DJ Nana, DJ Cuppy, while the Next Gen acts includes BlaqBonez, Boogey, Dami Oniru, Mich Straaw, Mo’ Belive, Ogaranya and Tems.
